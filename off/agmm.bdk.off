Thus his teachings were always appropriate for the particular suffering individual and for the time at which the teaching was given, and over the ages not one of his prescriptions has failed to relieve the suffering to which it was addressed.$Ever since the Buddha’s Great Demise over twenty-five hundred years ago,$his message of wisdom and compassion has spread throughout the world. 
Yet no one has ever attempted to translate the entire Buddhist canon into English throughout the history of Japan. 
It is my greatest wish to see this done and to make the translations available to the many English-speaking people who have never had the opportunity to learn about the Buddha’s teachings.$Of course, it would be impossible to translate all of the Buddha’s eighty￾four thousand teachings in a few years. 
I have, therefore, had one hundred thirty￾nine of the scriptural texts in the prodigious Taishō edition of the Chinese Buddhist canon selected for inclusion in the First Series of this translation project.$It is in the nature of this undertaking that the results are bound to be criticized.$Nonetheless, I am convinced that unless someone takes it upon himself or herself to initiate this project, it will never be done. 
At the same time, I hope that an improved, revised edition will appear in the future.$It is most gratifying that, thanksto the efforts of more than a hundred Buddhist scholars from the East and the West, this monumental project has finally gotten off the ground. 
May the rays of the Wisdom of the Compassionate One reach each and every person in the world.$ NUMATA Yehan$ Founder of the English$August 7, 1991 Tripiṭaka Project vii$Editorial Foreword$In January 1982, Dr. 
NUMATA Yehan, the founder of Bukkyo Dendo Kyokai$(Society for the Promotion of Buddhism), decided to begin the monumental task of translating the complete Taishō edition of the Chinese Tripiṭaka (Buddhist canon) into the English language. 
Under his leadership, a special preparatory committee was organized in April 1982. 
By July of the same year, the Translation$Committee of the English Tripiṭaka was officially convened.$The initial Committee consisted of the following members: (late) HANAYAMA$Shōyū (Chairperson), (late) BANDŌ Shōjun, ISHIGAMI Zennō, (late) KAMATA$Shigeo, (late) KANAOKA Shūyū, MAYEDA Sengaku, NARA Yasuaki, (late) SAYEKI$Shinkō, (late) SHIOIRI Ryōtatsu, TAMARU Noriyoshi, (late) TAMURA Kwansei,$URYŪZU Ryūshin, and YUYAMA Akira. 
Assistant members of the Committee were as follows: KANAZAWA Atsushi, WATANABE Shōgo, Rolf Giebel of New$Zealand, and Rudy Smet of Belgium.$After holding planning meetings on a monthly basis, the Committee selected one hundred thirty-nine texts for the First Series of translations, an estimated one hundred printed volumes in all. 
The texts selected are not necessarily limited to those originally written in India but also include works written or composed in China and Japan. 
While the publication of the First Series proceeds, the texts for the Second Series will be selected from among the remaining works; this process will continue until all the texts, in Japanese as well as in Chinese, have been published.$Frankly speaking, it will take perhaps one hundred years or more to accom￾plish the English translation of the complete Chinese and Japanese texts, for they consist of thousands of works. 
Nevertheless, as Dr. 
NUMATA wished, it is the sincere hope of the Committee that this project will continue unto completion,$even after all its present members have passed away.$Dr. 
NUMATA passed away on May 5, 1994, at the age of ninety-seven, entrust￾ing his son, Mr. 
NUMATA Toshihide, with the continuation and completion of the$Translation Project. 
The Committee also lost its able and devoted Chairperson,$viii$Professor HANAYAMA Shōyū, on June 16, 1995, at the age of sixty-three. 
After these severe blows, the Committee elected me, then Vice President of Musashino$Women’s College, to be the Chair in October 1995. 
The Committee has renewed its determination to carry out the noble intention of Dr. 
NUMATA, under the lead￾ership of Mr. 
NUMATA Toshihide.$The present members of the Committee are MAYEDA Sengaku (Chairperson),$ICHISHIMA Shōshin, ISHIGAMI Zennō, KATSURA Shōryū, NAMAI Chishō, NARA$Yasuaki, SAITŌ Akira, SHIMODA Masahiro, Kenneth K.

The$Publication Committee members have worked to ensure that this volume, as all other volumesin the series, has gone through a rigorous process of editorial efforts.$The initial translation and editing of the Buddhist scriptures found in this and other BDK English Tripiṭaka volumes are performed under the direction of the Editorial Committee in Tokyo, Japan. 
Both the Editorial Committee in Tokyo and the Publication Committee, headquartered in Berkeley, California, are ded￾icated to the production of accurate and readable English translations of the$Buddhist canon. 
In doing so, the members of both committees and associated staff work to honor the deep faith, spirit, and concern of the late Reverend Dr.$Yehan Numata, who founded the BDK English Tripiṭaka Series in order to dis￾seminate the Buddhist teachings throughout the world.$The long-term goal of our project is the translation and publication of the texts in the one hundred-volume Taishō edition of the Chinese Buddhist canon,$along with a number of influential extracanonical Japanese Buddhist texts. 
The list of texts selected for the First Series of this translation project may be found at the end of each volume in the series.$As Chair of the Publication Committee, I am deeply honored to serve as the fifth person in a post previously held by leading figures in the field of Buddhist studies, most recently by my predecessor, John R.

Madhyamāgama, T. 
26), which is translated here, is one of the four major canonical collections of early Buddhist sutras preserved in$Chinese.$2 The sutras grouped in this collection were deemed to be of “middle length” (Ch. 
zhong, Skt. 
madhyama: “middle”). 
The Chinese Ahan (Skt. 
Āgama)$collections correspond to the better-known Nikāyas of the Pāli canon. 
While the latter texts (the Dīghanikāya, Majjhimanikāya, Saṃyuttanikāya, and Aṅguttara￾nikāya) have long been available in English translation, none of the equally impor￾tant Āgamas has so far been rendered into English, or indeed any Western lan￾guage.$3 The Āgamas and Nikāyas constitute the Sūtra-piṭaka4 for the northern and southern transmission5 of Buddhism respectively, and they are the primary sources for what we know about early Buddhist doctrine. 
They remain of immense importance for the study and practice of Buddhism in both academic and religious contexts. 
With this translation we aim to make accessible another important wit￾ness, a view back onto the earliest period of the Buddhist tradition.$In the following I will outline the development of the text translated here,$from its beginning in the oral tradition, through its Indian and Chinese “incarna￾tions,” up to the present English translation. 
Our focus will be on the history of the text. 
For summaries and discussions of the content of individual sutras, the reader should refer to the works by Minh Chau and BhikkhuAnālayo cited below.$Āgamas and Nikāyas$It is not yet possible to give a comprehensive account of how exactly the Āgamas relate to the Nikāya corpus; the general outline, however, is clear. 
The four$Āgamas, all of which are now preserved intact only in Chinese, represent por￾tions of the Sūtra-piṭakas of various northern schools of Buddhism, which were transmitted in various Indian dialects and then made their way to the Buddhist xvi kingdoms of Central Asia and along the Silk Road into China. 
The Nikāyas contain the sutra texts of the southern tradition that were transmitted to Sri$Lanka and preserved in the Pāli canon, whose formative period was from the first century B.C.E. 
to the fifth century C.E.$Regarding the relationship between the Zhong ahan jing and the$Majjhimanikāya, Minh Chau’s groundbreaking 1964 study, The Chinese$Madhyama Āgama and the Pāli Majjhima Nikāya (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass,$1991, reprint), describes a number of differences in doctrinal and narrative content.$6 Bhikkhu Anālayo’s A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya$(Taipei: Dharma Drum Publishing, 2011) discusses in great detail all Chinese parallels to the sutras of the Majjhimanikāya, many of which are represented in our translation. 
In the course of his research Bhikkhu Anālayo has also translated and discussed a large number of sutras from the Zhong ahan jing.$In view of the extent of his contribution, the relevant citations are listed in an addendum to the bibliography.$As the translation work for this volume has shown again and again, com￾parison with the Pāli versions is often essential for an understanding of difficult passages. 
Although most Āgama sutras preserved in Chinese do have counterparts in the Pāli canon and vice versa, they are frequently found in different collections. 
According to Akanuma Chizen’s catalogue, Kanpa shibu shiagon goshōroku—The Comparative Catalogue of Chinese Āgamas and Pāli Nikāyas (Nagoya: Hajinkakushobō, 1929), of the two hundred and twenty-two sutras of T. 
26, only one hundred and three have their counterpart in the Majjhimanikāya; fourteen have their counterpart in the Dīghanikāya,$seventeen in the Saṃyuttanikāya, and eighty-seven in the Aṅguttaranikāya.$7$Fourteen of the two hundred and twenty-two sutras of T. 
26 have no known parallel in the Pāli corpus.$Madhyamāgama(s)$After the death of the founder, Buddhist texts were transmitted orally in$Middle Indo-Aryan dialects (Prakrits). 
While the southern tradition eventually settled on one of these dialects, Pāli, as its canonical language, in India and$Central Asia Buddhist texts were successively Sanskritized and/or translated into other languages such as Chinese, Tokharian, Khotanese, Sogdian, and$Tibetan.$8 Also, new Buddhist texts in India, from at least the third century$Introduction xvii onward, were directly composed in standard Sanskrit. 
Manuscripts from the northern tradition, especially those of Central Asian provenance, are therefore often in Prakrit (especially Gāndhārī)$9 or some nonstandard form of Sanskrit,$sometimes called Buddhist Sanskrit, an intermediate stage between some$Prakrit and standard Sanskrit.$Unfortunately, we do not have a complete Madhyamāgama in either$Sanskrit or Prakrit. 
Only for the Dīrghāgama do we have a (largely) complete$Indic manuscript;$10 for the other three collections there are only numerous manuscript fragments containing sometimes one or more sutras but more commonly only a few lines of text. 
These fragments stem from different peri￾ods and locations. 
As yet there is no combined edition of this material for any Āgama, nor is there general bibliographic overview. 
For the Mad￾hyamāgama, however, Jin-il Chung and Takamichi Fukita have catalogued all available Sanskrit fragments in A Survey of the Sanskrit Fragments Cor￾responding to the Chinese Madhyamagama, Including References to Sanskrit$Parallels, Citations, Numerical Categories of Doctrinal Concepts, and Stock$Phrases (Tokyo: Sankibo, 2011).$11$As with most other long texts that have been transmitted orally, and since the first century B.C.E. 
with the support of writing, we have to assume that no two instances of a text were ever fully identical, even though the$Indian oral tradition is known for preserving texts over long periods with very little variation.$12 If nothing else, the fact that the Madhyamāgama and the Majjhimanikāya share only about one hundred sutras out of two hundred and twenty-two (MĀ) and one hundred and fifty-two (MN), shows that the$Āgamas/ Nikāyas as collections were still in flux for a considerable time. 
In their current form the collections can be attested to the fourth to fifth centuries.$Only for the period since the translation into Chinese in the north (fourth century C.E.) and Buddhaghosa’s commentaries in Sri Lanka (fifth century$C.E.) can we be confident that the gestalt of the four major sutra collections has remained more or less unchanged. 
Generally, it is only after that time that it is possible to date further changes in either tradition.$13$The Sanskritized texts circulating in Central Asia continued to evolve after the fifth century, as is evident from the differences between later Sanskrit remains and the Chinese versions, but owing to the fragmentary nature of the$Sanskrit materials our knowledge about these changes is extremely limited.$14$Introduction xviii$The picture that emerges when the Sanskrit fragments are compared with the Chinese and Pāli versions is that several versions of the texts collected in the Āgamas/Nikāyas did exist between the first century B.C.E. 
and the fourth century C.E. 
During this time, when the oral tradition began to be sup￾ported by writing in both the northern and southern traditions, each document instance would have differed slightly, reflecting school affiliation, local tra￾ditions, linguistic environment, nonstandardized scripts, or any combination of these factors. 
Moreover, the manuscript evidence shows that some sutras contained in the Āgamas/Nikāyas circulated independently as well, a fact that is also borne out by the many instances of individual translations of$Āgama/Nikāya sutras available in Chinese.$To illustrate the situation with one example: the Shansheng jing (sutra$135 of T. 
26) exists in a cluster with at least thirteen other instances of the text: the Siṅgālovāda-sutta of the Dīghanikāya (DN, no. 
31), the Shansheng jing of the Chinese Dīrghāgama (T. 
1, no.16), the various Sanskrit fragments of the Śikhālaka-sūtra, two other individual Chinese translations (T. 
16 and$T. 
17), and a quotation in the Mahākarma-vibhaṅga.$15 There exist complex stemmatic relationships among these texts, which—as for most sutra clus￾ters—have not yet been clarified and perhaps will never be.$We are therefore faced with the fact that the collection of sutras translated in this volume is but one witness that has survived and attained prominence,$like a snapshot of the development of the text taken at a certain time at a certain place. 
The composition of the text is therefore to a degree arbitrary,$in the sense that T. 
26 would in all likelihood have looked rather different if the Chinese translation had been done earlier, or later, or from a version of another school. 
In this light, the statement “the Majjhimanikāya has one hun￾dred and fifty-two sutras and the Madhyamāgama two hundred and twenty￾two” loses some of its apodictic edge. 
It so happened that the Majjhima￾nikāya found closure with one hundred and fifty-two sutras, while incidentally the only surviving Madhyamāgama (preserved in Chinese as T. 
26) found closure with two hundred and twenty-two sutras.$This angle is emphasized here because all too often doctrinal statements are made on the basis of a single passage in a single instance of a text. 
To remember that some randomness is part of tradition does not amount to rel￾ativism or to the belief that there is no message at all in these texts; it means,$Introduction xix rather, that there is no final authoritative foundation on which to build one’s argument beyond the multiplicity and careful navigation of the text-clusters.$Before I turn to the translation of the Madhyamāgama into Chinese and the history of the Chinese text, a few remarks regarding the language of the source text for T. 
26 are in order. 
P. 
V. 
Bapat (“Chinese Madhyamāgama and the Language of its Basic Text,” in B. 
P. 
Sinha, ed., Dr. 
Satkari Mookerji$Felicitation Volume, pp. 
1–6 [Varanasi: Chowkhamba Publications, 1969])$compares certain passages of T. 
26 with the Pāli and with a Sanskritized ver￾sion of the verses of Upāli. 
He gives a number of examples showing that the source text for T. 
26 was identical neither with the Pāli nor with the Sanskri￾tized version. 
Regarding the original idiom, he concludes that it was “some form of Prakrit closer to Pāli, or some imperfect or corrupt form of a language using Sanskrit orthography but dominated by Prakrit grammar.”$Oskar von Hinüber (“Upāli’s Verses in the Majjhimanikāya and the$Madhyamāgama,” in L.A. 
Hercus, ed., Indological and Buddhist Studies,$Volume in Honour of Professor J. 
W. 
de Jong on his 60th Birthday, pp. 
250f$[Canberra: Faculty of Asian Studies 1982]), while not citing Bapat, compares some of the same passages in their Pāli, Sanskrit, and Chinese versions.$Independently, he too finds that the source text for T. 
26 was in nonstandard$Sanskrit. 
More precisely, he concludes that T. 
26 was translated from a text that had passed through a Gāndhārī stage and was in the process of being$Sanskritized.$On the basis of this and other research findings, Ernst Waldschmidt$(“Central Asian Sūtra Fragments and their Relation to the Chinese Āgamas,”$in H. 
Bechert, ed., The Language of the Earliest Buddhist Tradition [Göttingen:$Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1980], p. 
137) summarizes:$[T]he Ch’ang-a-han-ching (Chang ahan jing) as well as the Tseng-i￾a-han-ching (Zengyi ahan jing) have been recognized as obviously not translated from the Sanskrit, but from some Middle Indic or mixed dialect of Prakrit with Sanskrit elements.$This conclusion has been corroborated by our own observations made during the process of translation into English. 
That the language of the original text was not standard Sanskrit is evident from many transcriptions of names.$For instance, the name transcribed in T. 
26 as A li tuo16 (Pāli Ariṭṭha) cannot$Introduction xx have already been fully Sanskritized to Ariṣṭa, since the Chinese transcription includes no character representing a sibilant. 
This is in contrast to the tran￾scription A li se tuo17 used for the same name in the Chinese Saṃyuktāgama$(T. 
99).$From Madhyamāgama to Zhong ahan jing$The Madhyamāgama was translated into Chinese twice. 
The earliest infor￾mation concerning the history of these translations is preserved in the Chu sanzang jiji, a collection of records concerning early Buddhist texts in China by Sengyou (445–518). 
The Chu sanzang jiji preserves a preface (or possibly a postscript) to T. 
26 written by the monk Daoci (fl. 
398),$18 who himself par￾ticipated in the second translation.$The First Translation by Dharmanandin and Zhu Fonian$From the preface to the Ekottarikāgama written by Dao’an (314–385),$we learn that the monk Dharmanandin arrived in Chang’an in 384, having traveled along the Silk Road from Tocharistan (Bactria), which is located between the Pamir Mountains and the Hindu Kush. 
Most travelers who took the land route from India to China had to pass through Bactria and it therefore played an important role in the transmission of Buddhism.$19 Dharmanandin had memorized a Madhyamāgama and an Ekottarikāgama, two large col￾lections that had never been translated. 
Chang’an was at that time both a center of political power and a stronghold of Buddhism. 
Supported by the ruler Fu Jian (337–385) and members of the gentry, for some years Buddhism found a safe haven there at a time when most of northern China was in con￾stant upheaval.$The famous Dao’an, who organized many translation teams, and Zhu$Fonian (fl. 
365–410), who was one of the few fully bilingual Chinese monks in Buddhist translation history, were residing in Chang’an at the time Dharma￾nandin arrived. 
Soon Dharmanandin was asked to recite both of the Āgamas he had memorized, and Zhu Fonian translated them into Chinese. 
The Chinese monk Huisong served as scribe and recorded what Zhu Fonian dictated. 
In this role Huisong probably exercised considerable influence on the final wording of the text. 
This collaboration lasted from the summer of 384 to the$Introduction xxi spring of 385 and the task was probably completed, since a number of cat￾alogue records speak of a Zhong ahan jing in fifty-nine fascicles.$20 However,$in the fall of 385, Fu Jian was killed in the aftermath of his defeat in the battle of Fei River and the Chang’an region descended into chaos. 
It became impos￾sible for the monks to continue their work there. 
To make matters worse,$Dao’an, the group’s mentor, had died in the spring of 385. 
Shortly before his death he had written a preface to the newly translated Zhong ahan jing, which unfortunately has not survived.$21 After Dao’an’s death and in view of the deteriorating situation in the Chang’an region, the group of translators dis￾persed. 
Dharmanandin returned to the “Western Regions” and we hear no more of him.$The translation produced by Dharmanandin, Zhu Fonian, and Huisong was eventually superseded by a new translation produced by Saṅghadeva and his team just thirteen years later. 
According to Kōgen Mizuno, twenty￾four sutras of the first translation have survived and were preserved as indi￾vidual texts, which were never recognized as one distinct group by the cat￾alogue tradition.$22 Dated 515, Sengyou’s Chu sanzang jiji lists twenty-three of these sutras under “translator unknown,” and in 597 the Lidai sanbao ji,$as it so often does, provides spurious attributions for some of them. 
The fact is that until Mizuno’s research it was not noticed that the twenty-four sutras belonged together. 
With the help of computational stylistic analysis, it has recently been possible to corroborate Mizuno’s assumption that the twenty￾four sutras do indeed belong to one distinct group and were therefore translated by the same person(s).$23 The second part of Mizuno’s argument, however,$that the group of twenty-four is a remainder of the first translation by Dhar￾manandin and Zhu Fonian, remains a hypothesis.$As Mizuno has shown in “Kanyaku no Chūagonkyō to Zōichiagonkyō,”$Bukkyōkenkyū, vol. 
18, pp. 
7–9, at least one of the five Madhyamāgama quo￾tations in the Jinglü yixiang (T. 
2121, completed in 516) was taken from the group of twenty-four individual sutras. 
This and the other four quotations not only fail to accord with the corresponding passages in T. 
26; the juan references given for the passages are also clearly not those of T. 
26. 
This means that the Zhong ahan jing referenced in the Jinglü yixiang was not T. 
26,$and Mizuno assumes that the other four quotations from a Zhong ahan jing$Introduction xxii stem from the now lost part of the first translation of which he believes the group of twenty-four to be remnants.$However, there are reasons to doubt this.$24 There remains the problem that Sengyou in 515 still lists both translations of T. 
26 as extant,$25 while the individual sutras of the group of twenty-four are listed in the chapter on “mis￾cellaneous sutras by unknown translators” (T.55.2145:21b17). 
Moreover, in the case of the one passage that can be shown to stem from a sutra of the group of twenty-four (T. 
79), the reference does not simply say “Zhong ahan jing” but mentions the text, Yingwujing, by name. 
This is similar to another$Madhyamāgama reference in the Jinglü yixiang, where both a “Zhong ahan”$and a single sutra are mentioned.$26 There the Jinglü yixiang quotes or excerpts from a sutra cited as Pimoshi Mulianjing. 
In the group of twenty-four this corresponds to the Mo raoluan jing (T. 
66), and if Mizuno’s thesis is correct and the Madhyamāgama references in the Jinglü yixiang are based on the group of twenty-four, it seems that this passage in the Jinglü yixiang too should be based on T. 
66. 
However, none of the key terms of the Jinglü$yixiang passage appear in the considerably longer T. 
66. 
Considering that the narratives of the Yingwu jing and the Mo raoluan jing were rather popular and are attested in several versions, it seems very possible that the Jinglü$yixiang drew on individual translations (e.g., T. 
79 from the group of twenty￾four) as well as referencing the first translation of the Madhyamāgama. 
It does not necessarily follow, therefore, that the group of twenty-four is a rem￾nant of the first translation.$In any case, the Zhong ahan jing translated by Dharmanandin and Zhu$Fonian was still available to Sengyou in 515 and to Baochang, the main author of the Jinglü yixiang, in 516. 
The first catalogue in which it is recorded as lost is Yanzong’s Zhongjing mulu of 602.$27$The Second Translation by Saṅghadeva and His Team$After war and turmoil had dispersed the group of Buddhist translators working at Chang’an in 385, some of them regrouped in Nanjing. 
There they were sponsored by Wang Xun (350– 401), the eminent calligrapher and Mar￾quis of Dongting, who had established a vihāra for the study and translation of Buddhist texts. 
It was here that the Madhyamāgama was turned into the$Zhong ahan jing that we know today as T. 
26.$Introduction xxiii$Both the account given in the Gaoseng zhuan and the high level of con￾sistency in T. 
26 indicate that on this occasion the translation was done from a manuscript. 
According to Daoci’s preface, the project was again a team effort, with two Indian monks and three Chinese Buddhists working closely together. 
Saṅgharakṣa ascertained the Indian text from a manuscript and read it out; Saṅghadeva translated it orally into Chinese; Daoci set it down and probably decided on the final Chinese wording; and Li Bao and Tang Hua28$made final copies and took care of the resulting manuscript.$29 The team worked on the task for only seven months, between December 15, 397 and$July 24, 398, and the translation was nearly completed when their work was again interrupted by war. 
It was not until three years later, in 401, that a final version could be produced, containing the two hundred and twenty-two sutras in sixty fascicles. 
The swift pace of the translation work of these early masters puts us to shame; it has taken our team five years to complete only the first third of an English version of their translation, which was completed in less than a year’s time.$Why was it decided to retranslate the text? Saṅghadeva and most other members of the vihāra at Nanjing would have known Dharmanandin and$Zhu Fonian personally. 
Saṅghadeva and Dharmanandin had worked together in Chang’an as part of a translation team led by Saṅghabhūti in the same year that Dharmanandin and Zhu Fonian translated the Madhyamāgama for the first time (384).$30 It seems, however, that the translation by Dharmanandin and Zhu Fonian was not considered successful by the Nanjing team. 
According to Daoci, the first translation was “...
not true to the original, losing its mean￾ing. 
The names were not correctly realized, it was unclear and too lyrical,$while the expressions lacked taste.”31 This was because “the Chinese of the translators was not yet good enough.” This is surprising, considering the involvement of Zhu Fonian, who was widely praised as an able translator.$32$School Attribution of the Zhong ahan jing (T. 
26)$Concerning the attribution of the Zhong ahan jing to one of the early$Buddhist schools, there is a broad and long-standing consensus that the text is part of early Sarvāstivādin literature. 
The monk Hōdō (1740–1770) was the first commentator to analyze the Āgama citations found in the Abhi￾dharmakośa and with their help attempt to attribute the Āgamas to the various$Introduction xxiv schools. 
In his commentary on the Kośa he writes: “The Zhong ahan jing and the Za ahan jing both belong to the Sarvāstivādin school.”$(SAT/T.64.2252:440c). 
Hōdō was not always correct in his assessments,$33$but in this case later scholars have generally concurred with this statement.$Evidence discussed by Shōkū Bando (“Kanyakuzōagon-gyōkō,” Journal of$Indian and Buddhist Studies 30/2 [1982]: 856) and Fumio Enomoto (“On the Formation of the Original Texts of the Chinese Āgamas,” Buddhist Studies$Review 3/1 [1986]: 21) indicates that the source text for T. 
26 belonged to the Kashmiri Sarvāstivādin tradition. 
This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that Saṅgharakṣa, who provided the Indic text used for the second trans￾lation, was said to be from Kashmir.$34 Mizuno (“Kanyaku no Chūagonkyō$to Zōichiagonkyō,” p. 
6) also considers both Chinese Madhyamāgama trans￾lations to be Sarvāstivādin texts. 
In A Survey of Sanskrit Fragments Corre￾sponding to the Chinese Madhyamāgama, Chung and Fukita discuss the attribution of T. 
26 in great detail. 
They cautiously conclude that, however likely, the current consensus is not yet proven and in the absence of a clear understanding of the exact relationship between the various scriptures within the Sarvāstivādin corpus, much remains to be done.$35$Textual History of the Zhong ahan jing (T. 
26)$After the first translation went missing in the sixth century, the second translation became the Madhyamāgama translation that was included in the$Chinese canonical editions. 
The transmission history of this textus receptus is comparatively uncomplicated. 
Unlike the longer Chinese Saṃyuktāgama$(T. 
99), the original order of which became confused soon after its translation,$36$or the shorter Chinese Saṃyuktāgama (T. 
100), of which two differently ordered versions exist (Roderick S. 
Bucknell, “The Two Versions of the Other$Translation of Saṃyuktāgama,” Chung-Hwa Journal of Buddhist Studies 21$[2008]: 23–54), T. 
26 retained its structure during the six hundred years of its transmission in manuscript form. 
The text is still in the form that Daoci describes in his foreword: sixty fascicles containing two hundred and twenty￾two sutras grouped into eighteen divisions (Ch. 
pin, Pāli vagga), which again are grouped into five recitations.$At least since the eleventh century a character count was included in the colophon for each sutra.$37 Sampling the figures and comparing them with character counts done on the Taishō text shows that the average discrepancy$Introduction xxv is less than 0.001 percent. 
This indicates that the text has changed only min￾imally through the last thousand years, as is to be expected given that the$Taishō text is to a large degree identical with that of the second edition of the Tripiṭaka Koreana (carved 1236 to 1251).$For the Zhong ahan jing, the earliest manuscript witnesses are fragments preserved among the Dunhuang manuscripts stemming from the sixth to tenth centuries. 
These fragments, which are of varying length, rarely contain more than a few lines of text. 
The oldest complete witness of the Zhong ahan jing currently available is the Fangshan stone inscription.$38 Carved from 1153$to 1155, it is more than a hundred years earlier than the first complete printed versions preserved in the second edition of the Tripiṭaka Koreana and the$Qisha Edition (1216–1322).$39 The Tripiṭaka Koreana became the basis for the Taishō edition (published 1924–1932), which added punctuation and a rudimentary apparatus that collates the text with later Chinese editions and,$for some texts, with early manuscripts preserved in Japan.$The text translated here is the Zhong ahan jing of the Taishō edition, as presented in CBETA versions 2007 and 2009, where the Zhong ahan jing is shown with new punctuation provided by Yang Yuwen. 
The CBETA edition also transparently corrects printing mistakes in the Taishō and adds to the apparatus by referencing the form found in the second edition of the Tripiṭaka$Koreana in cases where the Taishō editors have silently emended the text.$Like the fourth-century Chinese translation of the Madhyamāgama, this$English translation was produced by a team. 
I have elsewhere explained in detail the process and rationale of this translation project (“Problems and$Prospects of Collaborative Edition and Translation Projects in the Era of$Digital Text,” in Konrad Meisig, ed., Translating Buddhist Chinese: Problems and Prospects [Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2010], pp. 
21–43). 
This is the first of three volumes projected for the translation of the entire text, and it contains the translation of divisions 1–6, sutras 1–71. 
The first draft translations were done by Bhikkhu Anālayo (division 1), Kin-Tung Yit (division 2), William$Chu (division 3), Teng Weijen (division 4), Marcus Bingenheimer (division$5), Shi Chunyin (division 6, fascicles 11–13) and Kuan Tse-fu (division 6,$fascicles 14–16).$All of the translations, including the footnotes, were thoroughly revised and edited by Bhikkhu Anālayo, Roderick Bucknell, and myself. 
The wording$Introduction xxvi of the draft translations was often changed substantially and I accept respon￾sibility for any remaining mistakes.$In our translation we have tried, in general, to follow the terminology and idiom that Bhikkhu Bodhi established in his translations of the Majjhima￾nikāya, The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha—A Translation of the$Majjhima Nikaya (Boston: Wisdom Publications, 1995) and the Saṃyutta￾nikāya, The Connected Discourses of the Buddha—A Translation of the$Saṃyutta Nikāya (Boston: Wisdom Publications, 2000). 
The final volume of our translation will include a comprehensive glossary that documents our choices. 
Conformity with a limited glossary of the most frequent terms was ensured by using the TransHelp program written by Jen-jou Hung.$40 This measure helped to achieve a degree of conformity at the level of terminology.$There remain, however, differences in syntax and style, from division to divi￾sion, a reminder of the collaborative nature of the project.$We follow Bhikkhu Bodhi in the belief that readers of the Āgamas will probably also be interested in the Nikāyas; we would like the texts to be easily comparable. 
For the same reason, we chose to give personal and place names in Pāli, not in Sanskrit. 
Considering that the Indian base text was written in a Prakrit, Sanskrit versions of these names too would have been somewhat different from the original. 
Most of the Indic terms included in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (e.g. 
Dharma, karma, or nirvana) have been used as English terms in the translation (without diacritics, in normal font, and taking the plural “s”).$Considering that this is the first translation of this text, we have faithfully reproduced all repetitions, i.e., no new elisions have been introduced. 
Elisions found in the Zhong ahan jing have, of course, been preserved as such.$We have omitted the character counts at the end of each sutra. 
These were added at some point before 1029 C.E., when the first Tripiṭaka Koreana was printed, to help preserve the Chinese text and it would have been mean￾ingless and potentially confusing to include them in the English translation.$Apart from the occasional double vocative, we have tried to translate every single term, even where words could—and perhaps for stylistic reasons should—have been omitted. 
In general we favored literalness over style, in the belief that the task of a first translation is to model the wording and syn￾tactic structures of the original as closely as possible. 
Obviously, there is$Introduction xxvii plenty of room for stylistic improvement in future English versions of these sutras. 
Interpolations to the text made by the translators generally appear in brackets. 
In the interest of minimizing endnotes, we have often abstained from making additional relevant comments that scholars might have appreciated.$Work on this volume started in 2006, roughly sixteen hundred years after the translation of the Madhyamāgama into Chinese, and was completed in 2009. 
Work on Volume II (divisions 7–12) and Volume III (divisions 13–$18) has begun and will continue until the successful completion of the project.$Venerable Anālayo has kindly agreed to take over as general editor for the successive volumes, freeing myself for a number of other projects that need my attention.$I am grateful to all those who have helped to bring this project to this stage. 
Ken Tanaka, Brian Nagata, and Yoshiyasu Yonezawa from BDK kindly answered many questions, and Marianne Dresser took good care of the copy￾editing and production. 
Venerable Huimin provided crucial support at several stages of the project. 
Jan Nattier and Jin-il Chung helped with bibliographic advice and made suggestions for the introduction. 
Yun-hee Oh provided me with information about the earliest print witness of the Zhong ahan jing. 
Jen￾jou Hung wrote the TransHelp program that helped us ensure a degree of con￾sistency. 
Hans-Ludwig Dürner read through parts of the final draft. 
I am espe￾cially grateful to my fellow editors and friends VenerableAnālayo and Roderick$Bucknell; without them “what was to be done, could not have been done.”$On behalf of all the translators and editors, I express the hope that this translation may contribute to the continuation and growth of the Buddhist tradition and the happiness of all sentient beings.$Introduction$Introduction$Abbreviations$AN Aṅguttaranikāya.

When thinking of leaving the household life, the noble disciple is reckoned as having withered leaves, like the withered leaves of the coral tree of the thirty-three gods.$Again, the noble disciple shaves off [his] hair and beard, dons the yellow robe, and, out of faith, leaves the household life, becomes home￾less, and practices the path. 
At this time the noble disciple is reckoned as one whose leaves have fallen, like the falling of the leaves of the coral tree of the thirty-three gods.$Again, the noble disciple, separated from desires, separated from evil and unwholesome states, with initial and sustained application of the mind, with joy and happiness born of separation, dwells having attained the first absorption. 
At this time the noble disciple is reckoned as one whose new leaves have appeared, like the appearing of the new leaves on the coral tree of the thirty-three gods.$Again, the noble disciple, through the calming of initial and sus￾tained application of the mind, with inward stillness and mental one￾pointedness, without initial and sustained application of the mind, with joy and happiness born of concentration, dwells having attained the second absorption. 
At this time the noble disciple is reckoned to have grown buds, like the growing of the buds on the coral tree of the thirty￾three gods.$Again, the noble disciple, separated from joy and desire, dwelling in equanimity and not seeking anything, with right mindfulness and right attentiveness, experiencing pleasure with the body, dwells having attained the third absorption, which the noble ones speak of as noble equanimity and mindfulness, a happy abode.$47 At this time the noble disciple is reckoned to have grown [buds] resembling a bird’s beak,$like the [buds] resembling a bird’s beak on the coral tree of the thirty￾three gods.$Again, the noble disciple, with the cessation of pleasure and pain,$and with the earlier cessation of joy and displeasure, with neither-pain￾nor-pleasure, equanimity, mindfulness, and purity, dwells having attained the fourth absorption. 
At this time the noble disciple is reckoned to have grown [buds] resembling bowls, like the [buds] resembling bowls on the coral tree of the thirty-three gods.$9$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Again, the noble disciple destroys the taints, [attains] liberation of the mind, and liberation through wisdom, and in this very life, per￾sonally attains understanding and awakening, and dwells having per￾sonally realized.

There will not be another existence.”$At this time the noble disciple is reckoned to be in full bloom, like the full blooming of the coral tree of the thirty-three gods. 
This monk is one whose taints are destroyed, an arahant. 
The thirty-three gods assemble in the Hall of the True Dharma and, sighing in admiration,$praise him:$Venerable disciple So-and-so, from such-and-such a village or town, having shaved off [his] hair and beard, donned the yellow robe, and having left the household life out of faith to become a homeless one, having practiced the path, he has destroyed the taints.$He has [attained] liberation of the mind and liberation through wisdom, and in this very life [he has] personally attained under￾standing and awakening, and dwells having personally realized.$He knows as it really is: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done.

^ck The Discourse with the$Water Parable50$Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s$Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: “I shall teach you about seven persons in the water. 
Listen closely, listen closely and pay careful attention!”$The monks listened to receive instruction.$The Buddha said:$What are the seven?$Suppose there is a person who remains lying in the water [below the surface].$And suppose there is another person who surfaces but then sinks again.$17$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$And suppose there is another person who surfaces and remains standing [in the water].$And suppose there is another person who surfaces and remains standing; and, having remained standing, observes. 
And suppose there is another person who surfaces and remains standing, and having remained standing, observes; and, having observed, crosses over [toward the farther bank].$And suppose there is another person who surfaces and remains standing; and, having remained standing, observes; and, having observed,$crosses over; and, having crossed over, reaches the farther bank.$And suppose there is another person who surfaces and remains standing; and, having remained standing, observes; and, having observed, crosses over; and, having crossed over, reaches the farther bank; and, having reached the farther bank, is called a “person dwelling on the [farther] bank.”$In the same way, I shall repeat to you the parable of seven persons in the water. 
Listen closely, listen closely and pay careful attention!$The monks listened to receive instruction.$The Buddha said:$What are the seven?$Suppose there is a person who remains lying [in the water].$And suppose there is another person who, having surfaced, sinks again.$And suppose there is another who, having surfaced, remains standing.$And suppose there is another who, having surfaced, remains stand￾ing, and having remained standing, observes. 
And suppose there is another who, having surfaced, remains standing; and, having remained standing, observes; and, having observed, crosses over.$And suppose there is another who, having surfaced, remains stand￾ing; having remained standing, observes; having observed, crosses over; and having crossed over, reaches the farther bank.$And suppose there is another person who, having surfaced, remains standing, having remained standing, observes; having observed, crosses$18^taisho424b Division 1$over; having crossed over, reaches the farther bank; and having reached the farther bank, is called a “brahmin dwelling on the [farther] bank.”$I have taught in brief this parable of seven people in the water. 
As it has been set out and described above, do you know what its meaning is, how to explain it, and what its moral is?$The monks said to the World-honored One:$The World-honored One is the source of the Dharma, the World-honored$One is the master of the Dharma, the Dharma comes from the World￾honored One. 
May he explain it! Having heard, we will come to know its meaning fully.$The Buddha said: “[Then] Listen closely, listen closely and pay careful attention! I shall explain its meaning to you.”$Then the monks listened to receive instruction.$The Buddha said:$What is [the meaning of] the person that remains lying [in the water]?$Here, a person is obstructed by unwholesome states, defiled by defile￾ments, experiencing the consequences of evil states, which create the root cause for birth and death.$This is what is meant by the person that remains lying [in the water]. 
Like a person who, having sunk and drowned, remains lying in the water, just so, I say, is this [defiled] person. 
This is what is meant by the first person in the water parable. 
Such [people] are really to be found in the world.$What is the person who, having surfaced, sinks again? Here, a person has “surfaced” by gaining faith in the true Dharma, keeping the precepts, practicing generosity, learning much, and [developing] wis￾dom, [thereby] practicing the true Dharma.$At a later time, [however,] he loses faith, which [then] becomes unstable, gives up keeping the precepts, practicing generosity, learning much, and [developing] wisdom—[these practices] thus become unstable.$This is what is meant by the person who, having surfaced, sinks again. 
Like the person who, having [nearly] drowned in the water,$19$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$surfaces but then sinks again—just so, I say, is this [backsliding] person.$This is what is meant by the second person in the water parable. 
Such people are really to be found in the world.$What is the person who, having surfaced, remains standing? Here,$a person has “surfaced” by gaining faith in the true Dharma, keeping the precepts, practicing generosity, learning much, and [developing]$wisdom, [thereby] practicing the true Dharma.$At a later time his faith [remains] firm and is not lost, and his keep￾ing of the precepts, practice of generosity, learning much, and [devel￾oping of] wisdom [remain] stable and firm and are not lost.$This is what is meant by the person who, having surfaced, remains standing. 
Like the person who, having [nearly] drowned in the water,$surfaces and remains standing—just so, I say, is this [stable] person.$This is what is meant by the third person in the water parable. 
Such people are really to be found in the world.$What is the person who, having surfaced, remains standing; and,$having remained standing, observes? Here, a person has “surfaced”$by gaining faith in the true Dharma, keeping the precepts, and practicing generosity, learning much, and [developing] wisdom, [thereby] prac￾ticing the true Dharma.$At a later time, his faith remains firm and is not lost, and his keep￾ing of the precepts, practice of generosity, learning much, and [devel￾oping] wisdom [remain] stable and firm and are not lost. 
Being estab￾lished in the true Dharma, he knows suffering as it really is, knows the arising of suffering, knows the cessation of suffering, and knows the path to the cessation of suffering as it really is. 
Through such knowing and seeing, three fetters are eliminated: namely, personality view, clinging to precepts, and doubt; and through the cessation of these three fetters, he attains stream-entry.$51 He is assured of progress toward full awakening within at most seven existences, without falling into evil states. 
Having passed through [at most] seven existences in heavenly or human realms, he will attain the ending of suffering.$This is what is meant by the person who having surfaced, remains standing, and having remained standing, observes. 
Like the person who, having [nearly] drowned in the water and having surfaced remains$20^taisho424c Division 1$standing, and having remained standing observes—just so, I say, is this person [who attains stream-entry]. 
This is what is meant by the fourth person in the water parable. 
Such people are really to be found in the world.$What is the person who, having surfaced, remains standing; having remained standing, observes; and having observed, crosses over? Here,$a person has “surfaced” by gaining faith in the true Dharma, keeping the precepts, practicing generosity, learning much, and [developing]$wisdom, [thereby] practicing the true Dharma.$At a later time, his faith [remains] firm and is not lost, his keeping of the precepts, practice of generosity, learning much, and [developing]$wisdom [remain] stable and firm and are not lost. 
Being established in the true Dharma, he knows suffering as it really is, knows the arising of suffering, knows the cessation of suffering, knows the path to the cessation of suffering, as it really is. 
Through such knowing and seeing,$three fetters are eliminated: namely, personality view, clinging to pre￾cepts, and doubt; and, having eliminated these three fetters, he [also]$reduces sensual desire, anger, and ignorance, and attains once-returning.$Having passed through one existence in a heavenly or human realm,$he will attain the ending of suffering.$This is what is meant by the person who, having surfaced, remains standing; having remained standing, observes; and having observed,$crosses over. 
Like the person who, having [nearly] drowned in the water and having surfaced, remains standing; having remained standing,$observes; and having observed, crosses over—justso, Isay, isthis person$[who attains once-returning]. 
This is what is meant by the fifth person in the water parable. 
Such people are really to be found in the world.$What is the person who, having surfaced, remains standing; having remained standing, observes; having observed, crosses over; and having crossed over, reaches the farther bank? Here, a person has “surfaced”$by gaining faith in the true Dharma, keeping the precepts, practicing generosity, learning much, and [developing] wisdom, [thereby] prac￾ticing the true Dharma.$At a later time his faith [remains] firm and is not lost, his keeping of the precepts, practice of generosity, learning much, and [developing]$21$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$wisdom [remain] stable and firm and are not lost. 
Being established in the true Dharma, he knows suffering as it really is, knows the arising of suffering, knows the cessation of suffering, knows the path to the cessation of suffering as it really is. 
Through such knowing and seeing,$the five lower fetters are eliminated—namely, lustful desire, ill will,$personality view, clinging to precepts, and doubt. 
With these five lower fetters eliminated, he will be born in another[, heavenly] realm and there attain final nirvana,$52 having attained the condition of non-return￾ing, not coming back to this world.$This is what is meant by the person who, having surfaced, remains standing; having remained standing, observes; having observed, crosses over; and having crossed over, reaches the farther bank. 
Like the person who, having [nearly] drowned in the water and having surfaced, remains standing; having remained standing, observes; having observed, crosses over; and having crossed over, reaches the farther bank—just so, I say,$is this person [who attains non-returning]. 
This is what is meant by the sixth person in the water parable. 
Such people are really to be found in the world.$What is the person who, having surfaced, remains standing; having remained standing, observes; having observed, crosses over; having crossed over, reaches the farther bank; and having reached the farther bank, is called a “brahmin dwelling on the [farther] bank”? Here, a person has “surfaced” by gaining faith in the true Dharma, keeping the precepts, practicing generosity, learning much, and [developing]$wisdom, [thereby] practicing the true Dharma.$At a later time, his faith [remains] firm and is not lost, his keeping of the precepts, practice of generosity, learning, and [developing] wis￾dom are stable and firm and are not lost. 
Being established in the true$Dharma, he knows suffering as it really is, knows the arising of suf￾fering, knows the cessation of suffering, and knows the path [leading]$to the cessation of suffering as it really is. 
Through such knowing and seeing, he attains liberation of the mind from the taint of desire, from the taint of becoming, and from the taint of ignorance. 
Being liberated,$he knows he is liberated; he knows as it really is: “Birth is ended, the$22^taisho425a Division 1$holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done.$There will not be another existence.”$This is what is meant by the person who, having surfaced, remains standing; having remained standing, observes; having observed, crosses over; having crossed over, reaches the farther bank; and having reached the farther bank, is called a “brahmin dwelling on the [farther] bank.”$Like the person who, having [nearly] drowned in the water and having surfaced, remains standing; having remained standing, observes; having observed, crosses over; having crossed over, reaches the farther bank;$and having reached the farther bank, is called a “person standing on the [farther] bank”—just so, I say, is this person [who has attained lib￾eration]. 
This is what is meant by the seventh person in the water para￾ble. 
Such people are really to be found in the world.$When I said earlier, “I shall teach you about seven persons in the water,” it was on account of this that I said it.$This is what the Buddha said. 
Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.$5. 
^ck The Discourse with the Parable of the Heap of Wood53$Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha, while dwelling among the people of Kosala, was traveling accompanied by a great gathering of monks.$At that time the World-honored One, while on the road, suddenly saw in a certain place a great heap of wood, all ablaze, intensely hot. 
On seeing it, the World-honored One went down from the side of the road, spread his sitting mat under a tree, and sat down cross-legged.$Having seated himself, the World-honored One addressed the monks:$“Do you see that great heap of wood, all ablaze, intensely hot?”$The monks answered: “We see it, World-honored One.”$The World-honored One said to the monks:$What do you think? To embrace, or to sit or lie [beside] that great heap of wood, all ablaze, intensely hot; or to embrace, or to sit or lie [beside]$a woman from the khattiya, brahmin, merchant, or worker [castes], a$23$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$woman who is in the full bloom of youth, who has bathed and perfumed herself, has put on bright, clean clothes, is wearing garlands, and has adorned her body with jeweled necklaces—which [of these two] would be the more pleasurable?$The monks answered:$World-honored One, to embrace, or to sit or lie [beside] that great heap of wood, all ablaze, intensely hot—that would be very painful.

If you wish to perfect the holy life, it would be better to embrace that great heap of wood, all ablaze, intensely hot, or to sit or lie [beside it]. 
Although one would, because of that, experience suffering or even death, yet, one would not, when the body breaks up and life ends, go to a bad realm and be born in hell.$If an ignorant person violates the precepts and is lax, giving rise to evil and unwholesome states, not practicing the holy life though professing to practice it,$54 not a renunciant though professing to be a renunciant, if he embraces or sits or lies [beside] a woman from the khattiya, brahmin, merchant, or worker [castes], who is in the full bloom of youth, who has bathed and perfumed herself, has put on bright clean clothes, is wearing garlands, and has adorned her body with jew￾eled necklaces—that ignorant person will, because of this unwholesome and unbeneficial [conduct], experience the fruits of his evil states for a long time.

Listen closely, listen closely and pay careful attention!$The monks listened to receive instruction.$The Buddha said:$What are the seven? A monk practices thus:$There is no self, nor is there anything belonging to a self; in the future there will be no self and nothing belonging to a self.

^ck The Discourse on [Sources of]$Worldly Merit$Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Kosambī, in$Ghosita’s park.$At that time, in the late afternoon, Venerable Mahā Cunda rose from sit￾ting in meditation and approached the Buddha. 
On arriving, he paid his respects and, sitting to one side, said: “World-honored One, is it possible to describe [the nature of] worldly merit?”$The World-honored One answered:$It is possible, Cunda. 
There are seven [sources of] worldly merit that lead to great merit, great reward, great reputation, and great benefit.$What are the seven? Cunda, a faithful son or daughter of good family offers a dwelling place or an assembly hall to the community of monks.$This, Cunda, is the first [source] of worldly merit that leads to great merit, great reward, great reputation, and great benefit. 
Again, Cunda,$a faithful son or daughter of good family offers [to those] in that dwelling place beds, seats, woolen blankets, felt mattresses, or bedding. 
This,$Cunda, is the second [source] of worldly merit that leads to great merit,$great reward, great reputation, and great benefit.Again, Cunda, a faithful son or daughter of good family offers to all [those] in that dwelling￾place new, clean robes of superior quality. 
This, Cunda, is the third$[source] of worldly merit that leads to great merit, great reward, great reputation, and great benefit. 
Again, Cunda, a faithful son or daughter of good family constantly offers to the community in that dwelling place morning rice gruel and the midday meal ...
provides monastic park$38^taisho428a Division 1$attendants to serve them ...
personally approaches the monastic park to make still more offerings, regardless of wind or rain, cold or snow$...
[ensures that after] the monks have eaten, their robes do not get soaked58 by wind or rain, cold or snow, [so that they can] enjoy med￾itation and quiet reflection by day and by night. 
This, Cunda, is the seventh [source] of worldly merit that leads to great merit, great reward,$great reputation, and great benefit.$Cunda, a faithful son or daughter of good family who has attained these seven [sources] of worldly merit, whether going or coming,$whether standing or sitting, whether sleeping or awake, whether by day or by night, their merit will continuously grow, increase, and become more extensive. 
Cunda, just as, from its emergence at its source to its entry into the great ocean, the river Ganges becomes increasingly deep and increasingly wide, in the same way, Cunda, the merit of a faithful son or daughter of good family who has attained these seven$[sources] of worldly merit, whether going or coming, whether standing or sitting, whether sleeping or awake, whether by day or by night, will continuously grow, increase, and become more extensive.$Thereupon, Venerable Mahā Cunda rose from his seat and, having bared his right shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground and, placing his palms together [in respect], said: “World-honored One, is it possible to describe [the nature of] merit that transcends the world?”$The World-honored One answered:$It is possible, Cunda. 
There are also seven [sources of] merit tran￾scending the world that lead to great merit, great reward, great repu￾tation, and great benefit. 
What are the seven? Cunda, a faithful son or daughter of good family hears that the Tathāgata or a disciple of the$Tathāgata is staying in a certain place. 
Having heard this, they are delighted and supremely inspired. 
This, Cunda, is the first [source] of merit transcending the world that leads to great merit, great reward,$great reputation, and great benefit. 
Again, Cunda, a faithful son or daughter of good family hears that the Tathāgata or a disciple of the$Tathāgata intends to come from there to here. 
Having heard this, they are delighted and supremely inspired. 
This, Cunda, is the second$39^taisho428b The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$[source] of merit transcending the world that leads to great merit, great reward, great reputation, and great benefit. 
Again, Cunda, a faithful son or daughter of good family hears that the Tathāgata or a disciple of the Tathāgata has come from there to here. 
Having heard this, they are delighted and supremely inspired ...
they personally go to see them and pay their respects with a pure mind ...
they present offerings to them ...
having paid their respects and presented offerings, they perform the threefold taking of refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma,$and the community of monks (Sangha) ...
they take the precepts.$This, Cunda, is the seventh [source] of merit transcending the world that leads to great merit, great reward, great reputation, and great ben￾efit. 
Cunda, if a faithful son or daughter of good family attains these seven [sources] of worldly merit and also these seven [sources] of merit transcending the world, their merit cannot be measured [in terms of] “so much merit,” “so much fruit of merit,” “so much result of merit”; it just cannot be encompassed, cannot be measured. 
This great merit cannot be calculated. 
Cunda, it is just as in [this land of] Jam￾budīpa there are five rivers, the Ganges being reckoned the first, the$Yamunā the second, the Sarabhū the third, the Aciravatī the fourth,$and the Mahī the fifth; and upon flowing into the great ocean, once within it, their water cannot be measured as “so many gallons”; it just cannot be encompassed, cannot be measured. 
This great water cannot be calculated. 
In the same way, Cunda, if a faithful son or daughter of good family attains these seven [sources of] worldly merit and again these seven [sources of] merit transcending the world, that merit cannot be measured as “so much merit,” “so much fruit of merit,” “so much result of merit”; it just cannot be encompassed, cannot be meas￾ured. 
This great merit cannot be calculated.$Then the World-honored One spoke these verses:$The river Ganges is pure and easily crossed,$The ocean, with its many treasures, is king of all waters.$Like the river’s water is the honor and respect of people in the world.$[Just as] all rivers reach and enter the great ocean,$So it is with people who offer robes, food and drink,$40$Division 1$Beds, couches, bedding, and seats,$Measureless is the fruit of their merit, leading them to a$ sublime realm,$Just like the rivers’ water entering the great ocean.$This is what the Buddha said. 
Venerable Mahā Cunda and the [other]$monks heard the Buddha’s words, were delighted, and remembered them well.$8. 
^ck The Discourse on Seven Suns59$Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Vesālī, in$Ambapālī’s Grove.$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks:$All formations are impermanent, of a nature not to last, quickly chang￾ing by nature, unreliable by nature.$60 Thus, one should not delight in or be attached to formations, one should loathe them as troublesome,$one should seek to abandon them, one should seek to be free from them. 
Why is that? There will be a time when it will not rain. 
At that time when it does not rain, all the trees, the hundreds of grains, and all medicinal shrubs will wither entirely, come to destruction and extinction, unable to continue existing. 
This is why [I say that] all for￾mations are impermanent, of a nature not to last, quickly changing by nature, unreliable by nature. 
Thus, one should not delight in or be attached to formations, one should loathe them as troublesome, one should seek to abandon them, one should seek to be free from them.$Again, there will be a time when a second sun will appear in the world.$When the second sun appears, the flow of all the streams and rivulets will become exhausted, unable to continue existing. 
This is why [I say that] all formations are impermanent, of a nature not to last, quickly changing by nature, unreliable by nature. 
Thus, one should not delight in or be attached to formations, one should loathe them as troublesome,$one should seek to abandon them, one should seek to be free from them.$Again, there will be a time when a third sun appears in the world. 
When the third sun appears, all the great rivers will become exhausted, unable to continue existing. 
This is why [I say that] all formations are imper￾manent, of a nature not to last, quickly changing by nature, unreliable$41^taisho428c The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$by nature. 
Thus, one should not delight in or be attached to formations,$one should loathe them as troublesome, one should seek to abandon them, one should seek to be free from them.$Again, there will be a time when a fourth sun appears in the world.$When the fourth sun appears, the great springs from which the five rivers of Jambudīpa emerge—the Ganges being the first, the Yamunā$the second, the Sarabhū the third, the Aciravatī the fourth, and the Mahī$the fifth—those great springs will all become exhausted, unable to con￾tinue existing.$This is why [I say that] all formations are impermanent, of a nature not to last, quickly changing by nature, unreliable by nature. 
Thus, one should not delight in or be attached to formations, one should loathe them as troublesome, one should seek to abandon them, one should seek to be free from them.$Again, there will be a time when a fifth sun appears in the world.$When the fifth sun appears, the water of the great ocean will recede by one hundred leagues, and continue receding gradually until it is$[only] seven hundred leagues [in extent]. 
When the fifth sun appears,$and the remaining water in the ocean is [only] seven hundred leagues$[in extent], it will continue receding gradually until it is [only] one hundred leagues [in extent]. 
When the fifth sun appears, the water of the great ocean will decrease [by the height of] one palm tree, and con￾tinue decreasing gradually until it has [a depth of only] seven palm trees. 
When the fifth sun appears and the remaining water in the ocean has [a depth of only] seven palm trees, it will continue decreasing grad￾ually until it has [a depth of only] a single palm tree. 
When the fifth sun appears, the water of the great ocean will decrease [by the height of] a person, and continue decreasing gradually until it has [a depth of only] seven persons. 
When the fifth sun appears and the remaining water in the ocean has [a depth of only] seven persons, it will again decrease gradually until it has [a depth of only] one person. 
When the fifth sun appears, the water in the ocean will decrease to the level of a person’s neck, to the level of the shoulders, of the waist, of the hips,$of the knees, to the level of the ankles, and [eventually] there will be$42^taisho429a Division 1$a time when the water of the ocean will be completely exhausted, being not sufficient to submerge [even] one finger.$This is why [I say that] all formations are impermanent, of a nature not to last, quickly changing by nature, unreliable by nature. 
Thus, one should not delight in or be attached to formations; one should loathe them as troublesome, one should seek to abandon them, one should seek to be free from them.$Again, there will be a time when a sixth sun appears in the world.$When the sixth sun appears, the whole great earth, together with Meru,$king of mountains, will be totally submerged in smoke, a single mass of smoke. 
Just as a potter’s kiln, at the time of being ignited, is totally sub￾merged in smoke, a single mass of smoke—in the same way, when the sixth sun appears, the whole great earth, together with Meru, king of mountains, will be totally submerged in smoke, a single mass of smoke.$This is why [I say that] all formations are impermanent, of a nature not to last, quickly changing by nature, unreliable by nature. 
Thus, one should not delight in or be attached to formations, one should loathe them as troublesome, one should seek to abandon them, one should seek to be free from them.$Again, there will be a time when a seventh sun appears in the world. 
When the seventh sun appears, the whole great earth, together with Meru, king of mountains, will be all ablaze, intensely hot, a single mass of flame. 
In this way, when the seventh sun appears and the whole great earth, together with Meru, king of mountains, is all ablaze,$intensely hot, a single mass of flame, [then] the wind will carry the flames even up to the Brahmā world. 
Then the gods of radiance, who have just been born as gods and have never experienced, seen, or known the world’s [cyclic] creation and destruction, on seeing that great fire will all be terrified, with their hair standing on end, and will think:$“The fire will not reach up to here, will it? The fire will not reach up to here, will it?” Those who were born as gods at an earlier time and have experienced, seen, and known the world’s [cyclic] creation and destruction will, on seeing that great fire, calm the distress of those gods, telling them, “Don’t be afraid! That fire is of such a nature that it will not reach up to here.”$43$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$When the seventh sun appears, Meru, king of mountains, will col￾lapse, will be completely destroyed and cease to be, [decreasing in height by] one hundred leagues, two hundred leagues, three hundred leagues, and so on until [decreasing in height by] seven hundred leagues,$it will be completely destroyed and cease to be.$When the seventh sun appears, Meru, king of mountains, together with this great earth, will be burned to destruction and extinction, with not even ash remaining.$61 Just as hot ghee or oil that is cooked or fried until it is completely exhausted and not even smoke or soot remains,$in the same way, when the seventh sun appears, Meru, king of moun￾tains, together with the great earth, will be [exhausted] with not even ash remaining.$This is why [I say that] all formations are impermanent, of a nature not to last, quickly changing by nature, unreliable by nature. 
Thus, one should not delight in or be attached to formations, one should loathe them as troublesome, one should seek to abandon them, one should seek to be free from them.$I have now told you that Meru, king of mountains, will collapse and be completely destroyed. 
Who can believe this? Only those who have seen the truth.$I have now told you that the water of the great ocean will be exhausted and eliminated. 
Who can believe this? Only those who have seen the truth.$I have now told you that the whole great earth will be burnt up and eliminated. 
Who can believe this? Only those who have seen the truth. 
Why is that?$Monks, in ancient times there was a great teacher called Sunetta.$He was the teacher of a school of non-Buddhist seers. 
Abandoning sensual desire, he had attained the bases of supernormal powers. 
The great teacher Sunetta had countless hundreds of thousands of disciples.$The great teacher Sunetta gave his disciples teachings about [the way to] the Brahmā world. 
When the great teacher Sunetta gave teachings about the [way to] the Brahmā world, some of his disciples did not adequately put his teaching into practice.$44^taisho429b Division 1$At the end of life, some of them were reborn among the four great kings, some were reborn among the thirty-three gods, some were reborn among the Yama gods, some were reborn among the Tusita gods, some were reborn among the gods who delight in creating, and some were reborn among the gods who delight in the creations of others. 
If, when the great teacher Sunetta gave teachings about the [way to] the Brahmā$world, all the disciples had remembered them well, they would have practiced the four divine abodes and, overcoming sensual desire, would,$at the end of life, have attained rebirth in the Brahmā world.$At that time the great teacher Sunetta had this thought, “In my next life I should not be reborn in the same place as my disciples. 
I$would now rather develop and cultivate loving-kindness.” Having developed and cultivated loving-kindness, at the end of life he attained rebirth among the gods of radiance.$At that time, the great teacher Sunetta developed and cultivated loving-kindness, and, having developed and cultivated loving-kindness,$at the end of life I attained rebirth among the gods of radiance. 
The practice of the path by the great teacher Sunetta and his disciples was not in vain; they obtained great reward.$Monks, what do you think? The great teacher in ancient times called Sunetta, who was the teacher of a school of non-Buddhist seers and who, overcoming sensual desire, attained the bases of supernormal powers, do you think this was someone else? Do not think that. 
Know that it was me.$At that time I was called Sunetta, a great teacher, the leader of a school of non-Buddhist seers. 
Overcoming sensual desire, I attained supernormal powers. 
I had countless hundreds of thousands of disciples.$I gave my disciples teachings about [the way to] the Brahmā world.$When I gave teachings about the [way to] the Brahmā world, not all of my disciples adequately put my teaching into practice. 
At the end of life, some were reborn among the four great kings, some were reborn among the thirty-three gods, some were reborn among the Yama gods,$some were reborn among the Tusita gods, some were reborn among the gods who delight in creating, and some were reborn among the$45^taisho429c The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$gods who delight in the creations of others. 
When I gave teachings about the [way to] the Brahmā world, if all of my disciples had put my teaching into practice, they would have developed the four divine abodes and, overcoming sensual desire, at the end of life they would have attained rebirth in the Brahmā world.$At that time I had this thought, “It is not proper for me to be reborn in the next world in the same realm as my disciples. 
I would now rather develop and cultivate loving-kindness.” Having developed and culti￾vated loving-kindness, at the end of life, I attained rebirth among the gods of radiance. 
Later, I developed and cultivated loving-kindness and, having developed and cultivated loving-kindness, at the end of life attained rebirth among the gods of radiance. 
The practice of the path by me and my disciples was not in vain; we obtained great reward.$At that time I personally practiced that path, which was of benefit to myself and of benefit to others, benefiting many people, out of com￾passion for the world, seeking the advantage and benefit of gods and human beings, seeking their peace and happiness. 
The teaching I gave at that time did not lead to the ultimate, was not the ultimate purity,$not the ultimate holy life, not the ultimate completion of the holy life.$At that time I was not able to abandon birth, old age, sickness, death,$sorrow, and distress. 
I was not able to attain complete liberation from suffering.$But now, monks, I have appeared in the world as a Tathāgata, free from attachment,$62 fully awakened, endowed with knowledge and [good]$conduct, well gone, a knower of the world, an unsurpassable being,$incomparable leader of persons to be tamed,$63 teacher of gods and human beings, called Buddha, protector of the world. 
I now benefit myself and benefit others, benefit many people. 
Out of compassion for the world I$seek the advantage and benefit of gods and human beings, seek [their]$peace and happiness. 
The teaching I now give leads to the ultimate, is the ultimate purity, the ultimate completion of the holy life. 
I have now abandoned birth, old age, sickness, death, sorrow, and distress. 
I have now attained complete liberation from suffering.$This is what the Buddha said. 
Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.$46$Division 1$9. 
^ck The Discourse on$Seven Chariots64$Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha, in the$Bamboo Grove, together with a great assembly of monks who were spending the rains retreat there. 
[At the same time] Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta was spending the rains retreat in the [Buddha’s] native region.$Then, a number of monks who had concluded the rains retreat in the$[Buddha’s] native region, the three months being over, having mended their robes, they put on their robes, took their bowls, and left the [Buddha’s] native region for Rājagaha. 
Traveling by stages, they reached Rājagaha, where they went to stay in the Bamboo Grove. 
Then those monks from the [Buddha’s]$native region approached the Buddha, paid their respects by bowing down their heads, and sat to one side.$The World-honored One asked them: “Monks, where have you come from, and in what place did you spend the rains retreat?”$The monks from the [Buddha’s] native region replied: “World-honored$One, we have come from the [World-honored One’s] native region, having spent the rains retreat there.”$The World-honored One asked them:$Among the monks living in [my] native region, which monk is praised by the other monks [thus]: Having few wishes and being contented himself, he speaks [to others] in praise of having few wishes and being contented; living in seclusion himself, he speaks in praise of living in seclusion; being energetic himself, he speaks in praise of being ener￾getic; having right mindfulness himself, he speaks in praise of right mindfulness; having mental one-pointedness himself, he speaks in praise of mental one-pointedness; having wisdom himself, he speaks in praise of wisdom; having himself destroyed the taints, he speaks in praise of destroying the taints; having himself exhorted, inspired, and fully delighted [others], he speaks in praise of exhorting, inspiring,$and fully delighting [others].$The monks from the [Buddha’s] native region replied:$World-honored One, the monks living in [the World-honored One’s]$47^taisho430a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$native region praise Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta [thus]: Having few wishes and being contented himself, he speaks [to others] in praise of having few wishes and being contented; living in seclusion himself,$he speaks in praise of living in seclusion; being energetic himself, he speaks in praise of being energetic; having right mindfulness himself,$he speaks in praise of right mindfulness; having mental one-pointedness himself, he speaks in praise of mental one-pointedness; having wisdom himself, he speaks in praise of wisdom; having himself destroyed the taints, he speaks in praise of destroying the taints; having himself exhorted, inspired, and fully delighted [others], he speaks in praise of exhorting, inspiring, and fully delighting [others].$At that time, Venerable Sāriputta was seated among the assembly. 
Then$Venerable Sāriputta thought:$The World-honored One has questioned those monks from [his] native region about this matter and the monks from [his] native region have given the greatest praise to Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta [thus]: Hav￾ing few wishes and being contented himself, he speaks [to others] in praise of having few wishes and being contented; living in seclusion himself, he speaks in praise of living in seclusion; being energetic him￾self, he speaks in praise of being energetic; having right mindfulness himself, he speaks in praise of right mindfulness; having mental one￾pointedness himself, he speaks in praise of mental one-pointedness;$having wisdom himself, he speaks in praise of wisdom; having himself destroyed the taints, he speaks in praise of destroying the taints; having himself exhorted, inspired, and fully delighted [others], he speaks in praise of exhorting, inspiring, and fully delighting [others].$Venerable Sāriputta thought further: “When I get to meet Venerable$Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta, I will ask him a few things. 
He would probably be com￾petent in understanding [and replying to] my questions.”$At that time the World-honored One, who had concluded the rains retreat at Rājagaha, the three months being over, having mended his robes, put on his robes and took his bowl, left Rājagaha for Sāvatthī. 
Traveling by stages, he reached Sāvatthī, where he went to stay in Jeta’s Grove,Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.$48^taisho430b Division 1$[Meanwhile,] after staying for a few days at Rājagaha, Venerable Sāriputta and the monks [who had come] from the [Buddha’s] native region put on their robes, took their bowls, and left Rājagaha for Sāvatthī. 
Traveling by stages, they reached Sāvatthī, where they went to stay in Jeta’s Grove,$Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.$At that time Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta, who had concluded the rains retreat in the [Buddha’s] native region, the three months being over,$having mended his robes, put on his robes, took his bowl, and left the$[Buddha’s] native region for Sāvatthī. 
Traveling by stages, he reached Sāvatthī,$where he went to stay in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.$Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta approached the Buddha and paid his respects by bowing down his head. 
Then he spread his sitting mat [at some distance] in front of the Buddha and sat down cross-legged.$Then Venerable Sāriputta asked some other monks: “Venerable friends,$is that Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta?”$The monks answered Venerable Sāriputta: “That is so. 
The venerable one who is seated in front of the Tathāgata, with fair skin and a prominent nose resembling a parrot’s beak, that is he.”$Then Venerable Sāriputta, having taken note of Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta’s facial appearance, retained a clear memory of it.$When the night was over, at dawn, Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta put on his robes, took his bowl, and entered Sāvatthī to beg for food. 
After having taken his midday meal, he put away his robes and bowl, washed his hands and feet, put his sitting mat over his shoulder, and went to a place for walking meditation in the Blind Men’s Grove. 
Venerable Sāriputta also, when the night was over, at dawn, put on his robes, took his bowl and entered Sāvatthī to beg for food. 
After having taken his midday meal, he put away his robes and bowl,$washed his hands and feet, put his sitting mat over his shoulder, and went to a place for walking meditation in the Blind Men’s Grove.$Then, when Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta had reached Blind Men’s$Grove, he spread his sitting mat beneath a tree and sat down cross-legged.$Venerable Sāriputta also, on reaching Blind Men’s Grove, spread his sitting mat beneath a tree not far from Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta, and sat down cross￾legged.$49$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$In the late afternoon, after rising from sitting in meditation, Venerable$Sāriputta approached Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta, exchanged friendly greetings, and, sitting down to one side, asked Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta:$“Is the venerable one practicing the holy life under the renunciant Gotama?”65$[Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta] replied: “That is so.”$[Sāriputta asked]: “How is it, venerable friend, are you practicing the holy life under the renunciant Gotama for the sake of purification of virtue?”$[Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta] replied: “Not so.”$[Sāriputta asked further]:$Are you practicing the holy life under the renunciant Gotama for the sake of purification of mind...

Once King Pasenadi of Kosala was in Sāvatthī and had some matter [to attend to] in Sāketa. 
He thought,$“Using what expedient means can I reach Sāketa from Sāvatthī in a single day’s journey?” He further thought, “I shall now have seven chariots arranged [along the road] from Sāvatthī to Sāketa.” So, he had seven chariots arranged [along the road] from Sāvatthī to Sāketa.$Having arranged the seven chariots, he set out from Sāvatthī in the first chariot. 
Riding in the first chariot, he reached the second chariot;$leaving behind the first chariot and riding in the second66 chariot, he reached the third chariot; leaving behind the second chariot and riding in the third chariot, he reached the fourth chariot; leaving behind the$52^taisho431a Division 1$third chariot and riding in the fourth chariot, he reached the fifth chariot;$leaving behind the fourth chariot and riding in the fifth chariot, he reached the sixth chariot; leaving behind the fifth chariot and riding in the sixth chariot, he reached the seventh chariot; leaving behind the sixth chariot and riding in the seventh chariot, he reached Sāketa within a single day.$When the king had dealt with the matter in Sāketa, the great courtiers gathered and surrounded the king, who was seated in the main hall, and respectfully said: “Great King, did you come in a single day from Sāvatthī to Sāketa?”$The king replied: “That is so.”$[The courtiers asked]: “Did the Great King come in a single day from Sāvatthī to Sāketa by riding in the first chariot?”$The king replied: “Not so.”$[The courtiers asked further]: “Did you come from Sāvatthī to$Sāketa by riding in the second chariot...
, by riding in the third chariot.$. 
. 
, (and so on up to) by riding in the seventh chariot?” [And to each question] the king replied: “Not so.”$What do you say, venerable friend: in what way should King Pase￾nadi of Kosala answer on being asked this by the gathering of courtiers?$[Sāriputta answered:]$The king [should] answer the gathering of courtiers: “I was in Sāvatthī$and I had some matter [to attend to] in Sāketa. 
Then I thought, ‘Using what expedient means can I reach Sāketa from Sāvatthī in a single day’s journey?’ I further thought, ‘I shall now have seven chariots arranged [along the road] from Sāvatthī to Sāketa.’ So, I had seven chariots arranged [along the road] from Sāvatthī to Sāketa. 
Having arranged the seven chariots, I set out from Sāvatthī in the first chariot.$Riding in the first chariot, I reached the second chariot; leaving behind the first chariot and riding in the second chariot, I reached the third chariot; leaving behind the second chariot and riding in the third chariot,$I reached the fourth chariot; leaving behind the third chariot and riding in the fourth chariot, I reached the fifth chariot; leaving behind the fourth chariot and riding in the fifth chariot, I reached the sixth chariot;$53^taisho431b The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$leaving behind the fifth chariot and riding in the sixth chariot, I reached the seventh chariot; leaving behind the sixth chariot and riding in the seventh chariot, I reached Sāketa within a single day.”$Thus, venerable friend, [should] King Pasenadi of Kosala reply to the questions put in this way by the gathering of courtiers.$[Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta said:]$In the same way, venerable friend, through purification of virtue, one attains purification of mind; through purification of mind, one attains purification of view; through purification of view, one attains purification$[from] the hindrance of doubt; through purification [from] the hindrance of doubt, one attains purification by knowledge and vision of [what is] the path and [what is] not the path; through purification by knowledge and vision of [what is] the path and [what is] not the path, one attains purification by knowledge and vision of the way; through purification by knowledge and vision of the way, one attains purification by knowl￾edge of the way to abandoning; through purification by knowledge of the way to abandoning, the World-honored One designates nirvana without remainder.$Then Venerable Sāriputta asked Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta: “What is the venerable one’s name? How do his companions in the holy life call the venerable one?”$Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta replied: “Venerable friend, I am called$Puṇṇa and my mother’s name is Mantāṇī;$67 therefore, my companions in the holy life call me Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta.”$Venerable Sāriputta expressed his praise:$Excellent, excellent, Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta! As befits a disciple of the Tathāgata, [the venerable one] has explained wisely, with intel￾ligence and determination, calm and without wavering, being an accom￾plished trainer who has achieved great eloquence, has attained the ban￾ner of the deathless, and dwells having himself realized the element of deathlessness—for the venerable one has been able, on being ques￾tioned, to respond fully on a profound issue.

^ck The Discourse on the Cessation of the Taints68$Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying among the Kurus,$at a Kuru town called Kammāsadhamma.$At that time, the World-honored One addressed the monks:$Through knowing and seeing, one attains the cessation of the taints,$not without knowing and seeing. 
How does one attain the cessation of the taints through knowing and seeing?$There is right attention and there is wrong attention. 
If one engages in wrong attention, then the not yet arisen taint of sensual desire will arise and the arisen [taint of sensual desire] will increase; the not yet arisen taints of existence and of ignorance will arise and the arisen$[taints of existence and of ignorance] will increase.

What are the seven? There are taints that are to be abandoned through seeing, there are taints to be abandoned through guarding, there are taints to be abandoned through$57^taisho432a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$avoiding, there are taints to be abandoned through using, there are taints to be abandoned through enduring, there are taints to be aban￾doned through removing, and there are taints to be abandoned through attending.$How are taints abandoned through seeing? The foolish worldling,$who has not got to hear the right Dharma, has not met genuine good friends, does not know the noble Dharma, and has not been trained in the noble Dharma—he does not know the Dharma as it really is. 
[Such a person,] through not practicing right attention, has the following thoughts: “I was in the past! I was not in the past! From what cause was I in the past? How was I in the past? I will be in the future! I will not be in the future! From what cause will I be in the future? How will$I be in the future?” He wonders about himself [in the present]: “What is this so-called self? How did it come to be? This present sentient being, from where has it come? Where will it go? Rooted in what cause does it exist? From what future cause will it exist?”$As he engages in wrong attention in this way, there arises [one or another of] six views. 
The view arises that there truly is a self; or the view arises that there truly is no self; or the view arises that the self perceives the self; or the view arises that the self perceives the not￾self; or the view arises that the not-self perceives the self; or the view arises that this is the self, namely that which is able to talk, able to know, able to act and to teach, and which acts and teaches, which is born in this or that realm and experiences the fruits of good and evil$[actions], which certainly has come from nowhere, certainly does not exist, and certainly will not exist.$This is called the deception of views, the agitation of views, the bondage of views, because of which the foolish worldling undergoes the suffering of birth, old age, disease, and death.$[On the other hand,] the learned noble disciple, who has got to hear the right Dharma, has met genuine good friends, and has been trained in the noble Dharma—he knows the Dharma as it really is,$knows suffering as it really is, knows the arising of suffering, knows the cessation of suffering, and knows the path [leading] to the cessation of suffering as it really is. 
Through his having come to know this as it$58^taisho432b Division 1$really is, three fetters cease: personality view, clinging to precepts, and doubt. 
Through the cessation of these three fetters, he attains stream￾entry. 
He will not fall into evil conditions and is assured of progress towards right awakening within at most seven existences. 
Having gone through [at most] seven existences in the heavens or among human beings, he will attain the ending of suffering.$If one does not know and see, then distress, vexation, dejection,$and sorrow will arise; but if one does know and see, then distress, vex￾ation, dejection, and sorrow will not arise. 
This is called abandoning the taints through seeing.$How are taints abandoned through guarding? A monk, on seeing a form with the eye, guards the eye faculty and, with right attention, con￾templates impurity. 
He is not guarding the eye faculty if, without right attention, he is contemplating purity. 
If one does not guard [the eye fac￾ulty], then distress, vexation, dejection, and sorrow will arise; but if one does guard it, distress, vexation, dejection, and sorrow will not arise.$Similarly for the ear, nose, tongue, body...
. 
On knowing a mind-object with the mind, [a monk] guardsthe mind faculty and, with right attention,$contemplates impurity. 
He is not guarding the mind faculty if, without right attention, he is contemplating purity. 
If one does not guard [the mind faculty], distress, vexation, dejection, and sorrow will arise; but if one does guard it, distress, vexation, dejection, and sorrow will not arise.$This is called abandoning taints through guarding.$How are taints abandoned through avoiding? A monk, on seeing a vicious elephant, should avoid it; ...
and similarly a vicious horse,$a vicious ox, a vicious dog, a poisonous snake, a dangerous path, a ditch or pit, a cesspool, a river, a deep spring, a mountain precipice, a bad companion, a bad friend, an evil heretic, an evil neighbor, a bad abode, [or] anything that would cause doubt to arise in his [previously]$undoubting companions in the holy life. 
A monk should completely avoid a bad companion, a bad friend, an evil heretic, an evil neighbor,$a bad abode, [or] anything that would cause doubt to arise in his [pre￾viously] undoubting companions in the holy life.$If one does not avoid these, then distress, vexation, dejection, and sorrow will arise; but if one does avoid them, then distress, vexation,$59$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$dejection, and sorrow will not arise. 
This is called abandoning taints through avoiding.$How are taints abandoned through using? A monk does not use his robes for the sake of gain, nor out of pride, nor for the sake of adorn￾ment, but for [protection against] mosquitoes, gadflies, wind, rain,$cold, and heat, and out of shame [to conceal the private parts].$He does not use food and drink for the sake of gain, nor out of pride, nor for the pleasure of growing stout, but to maintain the body and remove distress, vexation, dejection, and sorrow; for the sake of living the holy life, out of a wish to overcome former discomfort and prevent the arising of new discomfort; for the sake of living peacefully and without disease.$He does not use abodes and dwelling places, beds and bedding,$for the sake of gain, nor out of pride, nor for the sake of adornment,$but to allay fatigue and be able to meditate.$He does not use decoctions and medicines for the sake of gain,$nor out of pride, nor for the pleasure of growing stout, but to remove sickness and vexation, to preserve the life faculty and [remain] safe from disease.$If one does not use [these requisites properly], then distress, vex￾ation, dejection, and sorrow will arise; but if one does use [them prop￾erly], then distress, vexation, dejection, and sorrow will not arise. 
This is called abandoning taints through using.$How are taints abandoned through enduring? To energetically abandon evil and unwholesome [states] and develop wholesome states,$a monk continuously arouses the mind to wholehearted diligent effort,$[thinking]: “Even if the body, skin, flesh, tendons, bones, blood, and marrow should all dry up, I will not stop striving. 
Not until the goal has been attained will I stop striving.”$A monk should also endure hunger and thirst; cold and heat; mos￾quitoes, gadflies, flies, fleas, and lice; being assailed by wind and sun;$being verbally abused and being beaten with sticks—he is able to endure it [all]. 
[Even if] the body suffers disease causing such extreme pain that his life seems to come to an end—whatever is unpleasant, he is able to endure it all.$60^taisho432c Division 1$If one does not endure [such things], then distress, vexation, dejec￾tion, and sorrow will arise; but if one does endure them, then distress,$vexation, dejection, and sorrow will not arise. 
This is called abandoning taints through enduring.$How are taints abandoned through removing? When thoughts of sensual desire arise, a monk removes, discards, abandons, and gets rid of them.$69 When thoughts of ill will or harming arise, he removes, dis￾cards, abandons, and gets rid of them. 
If one does not remove [such thoughts], then distress, vexation, dejection, and sorrow will arise; but if one does remove them, then distress, vexation, dejection, and sorrow will not arise. 
This is called abandoning taints through removing.$How are taints abandoned through attending? A monk attends to mindfulness, the first factor of awakening, based on seclusion, dispas￾sion, and cessation, and leading to emancipation. 
[He attends to inves￾tigation of] phenomena ...
energy ...
joy ...
tranquility ...
concen￾tration...
; he attends to equanimity, the seventh factor of awakening,$based on seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, and leading to emanci￾pation. 
If one does not attend to [the factors of awakening], then distress,$vexation, dejection, and sorrow will arise; but if one does attend to them, then distress, vexation, dejection, and sorrow will not arise. 
This is called abandoning taints through attending.$If a monk, through seeing, abandons the taints that are to be aban￾doned through seeing; through guarding, abandons the taints that are to be abandoned through guarding; through avoiding, abandons the taints that are to be abandoned through avoiding; through using, aban￾dons the taints that are to be abandoned through using; through enduring,$abandons the taints that are to be abandoned through enduring; through removing, abandons the taints that are to be abandoned through remov￾ing; through attending, abandons the taints that are to be abandoned through attending—then he is called a monk who has abandoned all taints and has been liberated from all bondage, who has, through right knowledge, been able to make an end of suffering.$This is what the Buddha said. 
Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.$61$Division 2$On Karma$11. 
^ck The Discourse with the Parable$[of the Ounce] of Salt70$Thus have I heard: At one time, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s$Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.$At that time the World-honored One said to the monks:$[If one were to say]: “According to the actions a person does, he will experience the [exactly corresponding] result of those actions,” then in that case there could be no practice of the holy life and no attainment of the end of suffering. 
If [however,] one says: “According to the actions a person does, he will experience the result of those actions,”71 then in that case there can be the practice of the holy life and attainment of the end of suffering.$Why so? Consider the case of a person who has done an unwhole￾some action and must experience suffering as its fruit by [being reborn in] hell as a result. 
Why must a person who has done an unwholesome action experience suffering as its fruit by [being reborn in] hell as a result?$This is the case when a person has not cultivated the body, has not cultivated virtue, has not cultivated the mind, has not cultivated wisdom,$and his life span is very short. 
This is the case of a person who, having done unwholesome actions, must experience suffering as their fruit by$[being reborn in] hell as a result.$It is just as if a person were to drop an ounce of salt into a small amount of water, intending to make the water salty and undrinkable.$What do you think? Could this ounce of salt make that small amount of water salty and undrinkable?”$[The monks] replied:$63^taisho433a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Yes indeed, World-honored One. 
And why so? Because there is much salt but little water, therefore the salt can make the water salty and undrinkable.$[The Buddha continued:]$It is the same with a person who has done an unwholesome action and must experience suffering as its fruit by [being reborn in] hell as a result.

What do you think? Could this ounce of salt cause the water of the Ganges to become salty and undrinkable?$[The monks] replied:$No, World-honored One. 
And why not? Because, the water of the$Ganges is much while an ounce of salt is little, therefore the salt cannot make the water salty and undrinkable.$[The Buddha continued:]$It is the same with a person who has done an unwholesome action and$64^taisho433b Division 2$must experience suffering as its fruit by [experiencing] the result in this life.

The one who took the goat is perhaps a king or a king’s minister,$someone possessing much power. 
The owner of the goat is poor and powerless. 
Because of his lack of power, he can only hope against hope and, with his palms placed together, implore the other: “Sire! Please return the goat to me, or give me the price of the goat!” This is the case of a person who takes away another person’s goat.$In the same way, when a person has done an unwholesome action,$he must experience suffering as its fruit by [being reborn in] hell as a result.

^ck The Discourse to Vappa72$Thus have I heard: At one time, the Buddha was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu, in the Nigrodha Park.$At that time, after the midday meal, Venerable Mahā Moggallāna was sitting in the assembly hall together with a company of monks for some pur￾pose. 
Then a Sakyan by the name of Vappa, a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas, wan￾dering around after noon, approached Venerable Mahā Moggallāna and, after exchanging greetings, sat down to one side.$Then Venerable Mahā Moggallāna asked [the visitor] about this matter:$What do you think, Vappa? If a monk is restrained in body, speech,$and mind,$73 do you see any possible cause owing to which unwholesome taints might arise, leading to future existence?$Vappa replied:$Mahā Moggallāna, if a monk is restrained in body, speech, and mind,$I do see a possible cause owing to which unwholesome taints might$68$Division 2$arise, leading to future existence. 
Mahā Moggallāna, if someone has done unwholesome actions in a previous existence, then owing to that,$unwholesome taints will arise, leading to future existence.$[Soon] after this the World-honored One, who was meditating in a solitary place, heard with the purified divine ear, which surpasses that of [ordinary]$human beings, the conversation between Venerable Mahā Moggallāna and$Vappa the Sakyan, a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas. 
Hearing it, the World-honored$One rose from his afternoon meditation, went toward the assembly hall, and sat down on a prepared seat in front of the assembly of monks.$Having sat down, the World-honored One asked:$Moggallāna, what matter were you discussing with Vappa the Sakyan,$a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas? For what matter were you sitting together in the assembly hall?$Venerable Mahā Moggallāna replied:$World-honored One, today after the midday meal I was sitting in the assembly hall together with a company of monks for some purpose.$Then Vappa the Sakyan, a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas, wandering around after noon, approached me and, after exchanging greetings, sat down to one side. 
I asked him this: “What do you think, Vappa? If a monk is restrained in body, speech, and mind, do you see a possible cause owing to which unwholesome taints might arise, leading to future exis￾tence?” Then Vappa the Sakyan, a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas, replied:$“If a monk is restrained in body, speech, and mind, I do see a possible cause owing to which unwholesome taints might arise, leading to future existence.

Because of this matter,$we were sitting together in the assembly hall.$Then the World-honored One said to Vappa the Sakyan, a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas:$69^taisho434b The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$If you agree with what I say, you should say “yes”; if you disagree,$you should say “no”; and if you have any uncertainty, you should ask me further thus: “Renunciant Gotama, how is this?

May the renunciant Gotama discuss this matter with me!$The World-honored One asked:$What do you think, Vappa? Suppose that a monk has [in the past] given rise to unwholesome bodily activities, [resulting in the arising of] taints,$vexation, and worry, [but] that at a later time he ceases unwholesome bodily activities.

When there arises the feeling of life nearing its end, he knows that there has arisen the feeling of life nearing its end.$And when the body breaks up and life ends, the life span having expired,$then all that is felt in this life will be exhausted and come to an end. 
It should be understood that it will end and become cold.$Vappa, it is just like a shadow that exists in dependence on a tree.$Suppose that someone comes with a sharp axe and chops down the tree at its root, cuts it into pieces; then breaks [each piece] into ten or a hundred fragments, burns them in a fire so that they become ash,$which is then blown away by a strong wind, or carried away by water.$What do you think, Vappa? That shadow existed in dependence on the tree, so once the cause of the shadow has been cut off, will the shadow disappear and not arise again?$Vappa replied: “Indeed, Gotama.”$[The Buddha continued:]$Vappa, it should be understood in the same way in the case of a monk in whom ignorance has been extinguished and knowledge has arisen.$With ignorance extinguished and knowledge arisen, when there arises the feeling of the body nearing its end, he knows that there has arisen the feeling of the body nearing its end. 
When there arises the feeling of life nearing its end, he knows that there has arisen the feeling of life nearing its end.And when the body breaks up and life ends, the life span having expired, then all that isfelt in thislife will be exhausted and come to an end.

May the World-hon￾ored One accept me as a lay follower! From this day forth until life ends I go [to him] for refuge.$World-honored One, just as a person who raises a bad horse,$expecting to get benefit from it, only tires himself and gets no bene-$fit—World-honored One, I was like this. 
Those foolish Nigaṇṭhas lack right knowledge; they are unable to understand and know. 
Not recog￾nizing the fertile field [of the Buddha’s teaching], and not examining for myself, [I] revered them for a long time, made offerings, and paid them homage, expecting to get benefit from it; but I only suffered in vain. 
World-honored One, for a second time I now go for refuge to the$Buddha, the Dharma, and the community of monks. 
May the World￾honored One accept me as a lay follower! From this day forth until life ends I go [to him] for refuge.$World-honored One, formerly I was ignorant. 
Whatever faith and respect I had for those foolish Nigaṇṭhas has today been cut off. 
Why?$Because I was deceived. 
World-honored One, for a third time, I now go for refuge to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the community of monks.$May the World-honored One accept me as a lay follower! From this day forth until life ends I go [to him] for refuge.$This is what the Buddha said.

^ck The Discourse on [Tenets to Be]$Transcended74$Thus have I heard: At one time, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s$Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.$At that time, the World-honored One said to the monks:$73$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$There are three tenetsto be transcended, [tenets held by those] of different affiliation, different appellation, different school, and different doctrine that, despite being well accepted, firmly held, and declared to others by so-called wise men, are not beneficial. 
What are these three?$There are renunciants and brahmins who hold this view and declare:$“All that a person does is caused by what was done in previous lives.”$Again, there are renunciants and brahmins who hold this view and declare: “All that a person does is caused and created by a supreme divine being.” Again, there are renunciants and brahmins who hold this view and declare: “All that a person does is without any cause or condition.”$Herein, if there are renunciants and brahmins who hold this view and declare: “All that a person does is caused by what was done in pre￾vious lives,” then I approach them and, having approached them, I ask:$Venerable friends, is it true that you hold this view and declare:$“All that a person does is caused by what was done in previous lives?”$They reply: “Yes.” Then I say to them:$If that is so, venerable friends, then you all endorse75 killing living beings. 
Why is that? Because all is caused by what was done in previous lives[, therefore people cannot have moral responsibility for their actions]. 
In the same way, venerable friends, you endorse taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech ...
(and so on up to) wrong views. 
Why is that? Because all of that is caused by what was done in previous lives. 
Venerable friends, if the view that all is caused by what was done in previous lives were true,$then it would follow logically76 that all that one does or does not,$takes place without desire, without effort. 
Venerable friends, if in doing a deed or not doing it, a person lacks true understanding,$then he has lost right mindfulness and lacks right attentiveness,$and hence is unteachable.$If renunciants [and brahmins] proclaim such a teaching, then those renunciants and brahmins can be refuted by such reasoning.$74^taisho435b Division 2$Herein, if there are renunciants and brahmins who hold this view and declare: “All that a person does is caused and created by a supreme divine being,” then I approach them and, having approached, I ask:$Venerable friends, is it true that you hold this view and declare:$“All that a person does is caused and created by a supreme divine being?”$They reply: “Yes.” Then I say to them:$If that is so, venerable friends, then you all endorse killing living beings.

Again,$there is the teaching on the six elements, which, having known and realized it by myself, I have taught to you; it cannot be refuted, cannot be defiled, and cannot be prevailed over by any renunciant, brahmin,$gods, Māras, Brahmās, or anyone else in the world.$What is the teaching on the six sense bases, which, having known and realized it by myself, I have taught to you? [The six] are the eye sense base, the ear ...

[and] the mind sense base. 
This is the teaching on the six sense bases which, having known and realized it by myself, I have taught to you. 
What is the teaching on the six elements which, having known and realized it by myself, I have taught to you? [The six] are the elements of earth ...$water ...

and the element of consciousness.$This is the teaching on the six elements which, having known and real￾ized it by myself, I have taught to you.$Because of the combination of the six elements, there is rebirth from a mother’s womb; because of the six elements, there are the six sense bases; because of the six sense bases, there is contact; and because$76$Division 2$of contact there is feeling. 
Monks, one who has feeling will [be able to] know suffering as it really is, know the arising of suffering, know the cessation of suffering, and know the path to the cessation of the suffering as it really is.$What is knowing suffering as it really is? It is this: birth is suffering,$old age is suffering, disease is suffering, death is suffering, association with what is disliked is suffering, dissociation from what is liked is suffering, not getting what one wants is suffering; in brief, the five aggregates of clinging are suffering—this is called knowing suffering as it really is.$What is knowing the arising of suffering as it really is? It is craving for and clinging to future existence, with delight and desire, seeking after this and that [state of] existence—this is called knowing the arising of suffering as it really is.$What is knowing the cessation of suffering as it really is? It is the cutting off without remainder, abandoning, disgorging, fading away,$cessation, stopping, and disappearance of this craving for and clinging to future existence, with delight and desire, seeking after this and that$[state of] existence—this is called knowing the cessation of suffering as it really is.$What is knowing the path to the cessation of suffering as it really is? It is the noble eightfold path: right view ...
(and so on up to) right concentration, these eight—this is called knowing the path to the ces￾sation of suffering as it really is.$Monks, you should know suffering as it really is, you should cut off the arising of suffering, you should realize the cessation of suffering,$and you should cultivate the path to the cessation of suffering. 
If a monk knows suffering as it really is, cuts off the arising of suffering,$realizes the cessation of suffering, and cultivates the path to the cessation of suffering, then that monk, having abandoning all taints, having loos￾ened all fetters, is able through right attentiveness to attain the end of suffering.$This is what the Buddha said. 
Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.$77^taisho436a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$14. 
^ck The Discourse to Rāhula77$Thus have I heard: At one time, the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha, in the$Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.$At that time, Venerable Rāhula was also staying at Rājagaha, in the Hot$Spring Grove. 
Then the World-honored One, when the night was over, at dawn, having put on his robes and taken his almsbowl, went into Rājagaha to beg for food. 
Having finished begging for food, he went to the Hot Spring$Grove, the place where the venerable Rāhula was staying. 
When Venerable$Rāhula saw the Buddha coming in the distance, he forthwith went to greet him, took the Buddha’s [outer] robe and bowl, made a seat ready, and set out water for washing feet. 
The Buddha, having washed his feet, sat down on the seat prepared by Rāhula.$Then the World-honored One took the water vessel and, having poured out the water until only a little was left, asked: “Rāhula, did you see me taking this water vessel and pouring out the water until only a little was left?”$Rāhula replied: “Yes, I saw it, World-honored One.”$The Buddha told Rāhula:$In the same way, the practice of those who knowingly speak falsehood without embarrassment or regret, without shame or scruple, is of little$[worth], I say. 
Rāhula, there is no evil they would not do. 
Therefore,$Rāhula, you should train yourself like this: “Even in jest I shall not speak falsehood.”$The World-honored One again took the water vessel containing a little water and, having completely discarded the water, asked: “Rāhula, now again,$did you see me take this water vessel containing a little water, and completely discard the water?”$Rāhula replied: “Yes, I saw it, World-honored One.”$The Buddha told Rāhula:$In the same way, the practice of those who knowingly speak falsehood without embarrassment or regret, without shame or scruple, is com￾pletely discarded, I say. 
Rāhula, there is no evil they would not do.$Therefore, Rāhula, you should train yourself like this: “Even in jest I$shall not speak falsehood.”$78^taisho436b Division 2$The World-honored One again took the empty water vessel, tipped it over on the ground, and asked: “Rāhula, now again, did you see me take the empty water vessel, and tip it over on the ground?”$Rāhula replied: “Yes, I saw it, World-honored One.”$The Buddha told Rāhula:$In the same way, the practice of those who knowingly speak falsehood without embarrassment or regret, without shame or scruple, is tipped over, I say. 
Rāhula, there is no evil they would not do. 
Therefore,$Rāhula, you should train yourself like this: “Even in jest I shall not speak falsehood.”$The World-honored One again took the tipped water vessel and, having turned it bottom up, asked: “Rāhula, did you see me again take the toppled water vessel and turn it bottom up?”$Rāhula replied: “Yes, I saw it, World-honored One.”$The Buddha told Rāhula:$In the same way, the practice of those who knowingly speak falsehood without embarrassment or regret, without shame or scruple, is turned bottom up, I say. 
Rāhula, there is no evil they would not do. 
Therefore,$Rāhula, you should train yourself like this: “Even in jest I shall not speak falsehood.”$Rāhula, it is just as if a king had a great elephant who, when going into battle, uses his forefeet, his hindfeet, his tail,shoulders, back, flanks,$neck, head, ears, and tusks— everything except histrunk, which he keeps protected. 
Seeing this, the elephant trainer would think in this way:$The king’s great elephant still cherishes his life. 
Why so? Because when going into battle, the king’s great elephant uses his forefeet,$his hindfeet, his tail, shoulders, back, flanks, neck, head, ears, and tusks—everything except his trunk, which he keeps protected.$Rāhula, if when going into battle, the king’s great elephant uses his forefeet, his hindfeet, his tail, shoulders, back, flanks, neck, head, ears,$tusks, and also his trunk—if he uses everything—then on seeing this the elephant trainer would think in this way:$79$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$The king’s elephant no longer cherishes his life. 
Why so? Because when going into battle, the king’s great elephant uses his forefeet,$his hindfeet, his tail, shoulders, back, flanks, neck, head, ears,$tusks, and also his trunk; he uses everything.$Rāhula, if the king’s great elephant, when going into battle, uses his forefeet, his hindfeet, his tail, shoulders, back, flanks, neck, head, ears,$tusks, and also his trunk—if he uses everything—then Rāhula, I say that when going into battle, there is no evil that the king’s great elephant would not do. 
So too, Rāhula, those who knowingly speak falsehood without embarrassment or regret, without shame or scruple, Rāhula, I$say that there is no evil they would not do. 
Therefore, Rāhula, you should train yourself like this: “Even in jest I shall not speak falsehood.”$Then, the World-honored One uttered the following verses:$He who transgresses this one law$Against speaking falsehood:$Not fearing the next world,$There is no evil he would not do.$Better to swallow an iron ball,$Burning hot like fire,$Than to transgress the precepts$While accepting the offerings of the faithful.$If you fear suffering,$Not even wishing to think of it,$Whether secretly or openly,$Perform no evil deed.$An unwholesome deed,$Already done or being done,$Can never be escaped;$One cannot hide from [its result].$Having uttered these verses, the Buddha asked Rāhula further: “What do you think, Rāhula? For what purpose do people use a mirror?”$80^taisho436c Division 2$Venerable Rāhula replied: “World-honored One, they wish to examine their face, to see if it is clean or not.”$[The Buddha continued:]$Similarly, Rāhula, if you are about to perform a bodily action, then examine that bodily action: “I am about to perform a bodily action.

You should confess and declare it, being careful not to hide it, and you should exercise greater restraint [in the future].$[But,] Rāhula, if on examining it you know: “I have performed a bodily action, which is already past, having ceased completely or changed.$That bodily action was pure, either for myself or for another; it was wholesome, has happiness as its fruit, and will result in the experience of happiness”—then, Rāhula, you should dwell happily day and night,$with right mindfulness and right attentiveness.$(It is the same for verbal actions.)$Rāhula, if with a past deed as its condition a mental action arises,$then examine that mental action: “With a past deed as its condition, a mental action arose.

That mental action, which is already past,$having ceased completely or changed, was impure, either for myself or for another; it was unwholesome, has suffering as its fruit, and will result in the experience of suffering”—then, Rāhula, you should aban￾don that past mental action.

^ck The Discourse on$Intention80$Thus have I heard: At one time, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s$Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.$84$Division 2$At that time, the World-honored One told the monks:$If a person does an action intentionally, then he will have to experience its result, either in this life or in the next life, I say. 
If a person does an action unintentionally, then he will not have to experience the result,$I say. 
In this connection, there are three intentionally done bodily actions that are unwholesome, have suffering as their fruit, and result in the experience of suffering. 
There are four [intentionally done]$verbal actions and three [intentionally done] mental actions that are unwholesome, have suffering as their fruit, and result in the experience of suffering.$What are the three intentionally done bodily actions that are unwholesome, have suffering as their fruit, and result in the experience of suffering? The first is killing living beings: someone is extremely evil and bloodthirsty, has the desire to harm, and has no compassion toward [any kind of] living being, including insects.$The second is taking what is not given: someone has attachment to another’s property and, with thieving intent, takes it.$The third is sexual misconduct: someone has sexual relations with a woman who is under the protection of her father, or under the protection of her mother, or under the protection of both father and mother, or under the protection of her sisters, or under the protection of her brothers, or under the protection of her parents-in-law, or under the protection of her relatives, or under the protection of her clan; or with a woman who is married to another man, [in spite of] the fear of being punished, or with$[a woman] who has been garlanded as a sign of betrothal.$These are the three intentionally done bodily actions that are unwholesome, have suffering as their fruit, and result in the experience of suffering. 
What are the four intentionally done verbal actions that are unwholesome, have suffering as their fruit, and result in the expe￾rience of suffering?$The first is false speech: someone, perhaps in an assembly, or among one’s retainers, or in the king’s palace, on being told “Say what you know!”, claims to know what he does not know, or claims not to know what he does know; claims to have seen what he has not seen,$85^taisho437c The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$or claims not to have seen what he did see; be it for his own sake, or for the sake of others, or for the sake of profit, he knowingly speaks falsehood.$The second is divisive speech: someone wishes to divide others;$hearing something from this person he tells it to that person, in order to harm this person; hearing something from that person he tells it to this person, in order to harm that person. 
He desires to divide those who are united, and to further split those who are already divided; he creates factions, delights in factions, and praises factions.$The third is harsh speech: someone utters speech that is rough and rude in tone, offensive words that grate on the ear, that people neither enjoy nor desire; he utters such speech as causes others suffering and vexation, that is not conductive to concentration.$The fourth is frivolous speech: someone makes talk that is untimely,$untrue talk, meaningless talk, talk that is contrary to the Dharma, that is not calming; furthermore he praises what is not conductive to calming,$and teaches and admonishes others in an untimely and unwholesome way.$These are the four intentionally done verbal actions that are unwholesome, have suffering as their fruit, and result in the experience of suffering.$What are the three intentionally done mental actions that are unwholesome, have suffering as their fruit, and result in the experience of suffering?$The first is covetousness: someone views another’s wealth and lifestyle, constantly longing for them and wishing: “If only I could get that!”$The second is ill will: someone’s mind is filled with ill will and he thinks: “Those beings should be killed, bound, arrested, removed, or banished.” His wish is for them to experience immeasurable suffering.$The third is wrong view: someone holds distorted views. 
Views such as these, tenets such as these:$There is no offering, no sacrifice, there are no incantations; no wholesome or unwholesome actions, no results of wholesome or unwholesome actions; there is neither this world nor another world,$86$Division 2$there are no father and mother; there are no True Persons in the world who are headed for a supreme attainment, who are well gone and well directed, who have known and realized for themselves this world and the other world, and who dwell having personally realized.$These are the three intentionally done mental actions that are unwholesome, have suffering as their fruit, and result in the experience of suffering.$A learned noble disciple abandons unwholesome bodily actions and practices wholesome bodily actions; he abandons unwholesome verbal and mental actions and practices wholesome verbal and mental actions. 
That learned noble disciple, endowed with diligence and virtue in this way, achieves pure bodily actions, pure verbal actions, and pure mental actions. 
He abandons ill will and quarrel, discards sloth and torpor, is without restlessness and conceit, he cuts off doubt; he tran￾scends arrogance, has right mindfulness and right attentiveness, and is without confusion.$With a mind imbued with loving-kindness, he dwells pervading one direction, likewise the second, the third, and the fourth direction,$and also the four intermediate directions, above, and below, all around,$everywhere. 
With a mind imbued with loving-kindness, free from fetters or resentment, without ill will or quarrel, he dwells pervading the entire world [with a mind] that is boundless, exalted, immeasurable and well cultivated. 
He thinks: “Formerly my mind was narrow and not well cul￾tivated; now my mind is immeasurable and well cultivated.”$If the learned noble disciple, whose mind is [now] thus immeas￾urable and well cultivated, had earlier neglected his practice because of bad friends and done unwholesome actions, then he will no longer be led along by them. 
They cannot corrupt him and will not accompany him further.$Suppose there were a young boy or a young girl who, since birth,$had been able to practice liberation of the mind through loving-kindness.$Would he or she later perform unwholesome bodily, verbal, or mental actions?$The monks replied: “No, World-honored One. 
And why not? Since he or she has never done an evil deed, how could evil deeds arise?”$87^taisho438a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$[The Buddha continued:]$Therefore, a man or woman, whether layperson or renunciant, should always diligently practice liberation of the mind through loving-kind￾ness.

^ck The Discourse to the$Kālāmas81$Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha, who was wandering in the territory of the Kālāmas together with a great company of monks, having arrived at$Kesaputta, was staying in a rosewood grove north of Kesaputta.$At that time, the Kālāmas of Kesaputta heard that the renunciant Gotama,$a son of the Sakyans, who had gone forth from the Sakya clan to train in the path, was wandering in the territory of the Kālāmas together with a great company of monks and, having arrived at Kesaputta, was staying in a rose￾wood grove north of Kesaputta.$[They also heard that] the renunciant Gotama had a great reputation,$which had spread in all the ten directions:$The renunciant Gotama is a Tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, a Well-gone One,$a knower of the world, an unsurpassed one, a trainer of those to be tamed, a teacher of gods and human beings, and known as the Buddha,$the Fortunate One.$In this world, with its gods, Māras, Brahmās, renunciants, and brah￾mins, from human beings to gods, he has [attained] understanding and awakening by himself, and dwells having personally realized it. 
The$Dharma he teaches is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and$89$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, revealing a holy life endowed with purity.$If one visits such a Tathāgata, who is free from attachment and fully awakened, [if one] pays homage to him respectfully and serves him, then one will quickly get good rewards.$[They thought:] “We should go together to see the renunciant Gotama and pay homage to him.”$Having learned [of the Buddha], the Kālāmas of Kesaputta left Kesaputta,$relatives walking in groups together. 
They went north toward the rosewood grove to visit the World-honored One and pay homage to him. 
Having approached the Buddha, some of the Kālāmas paid respect with their heads at the Buddha’s feet and sat to one side; some exchanged courteous greetings with the Buddha and sat to one side; some saluted the Buddha with their palms placed together and sat to one side; and some, having seen the Buddha from a distance, sat down silently.$When each of the Kālāmas was seated and settled, the Buddha taught them Dharma, exhorting, encouraging, and delighting them. 
Having, by countless skillful means, taught them Dharma, having exhorted, encouraged,$and delighted them, he remained silent.$Then the Kālāmas, having been taught Dharma by the Buddha, having been exhorted, encouraged and delighted, rose from their seats, arranged their clothes so as to bare one shoulder, saluted the Buddha by placing their palms together, and said to the World-honored One:$Gotama, some renunciant or brahmin approaches [us] Kālāmas and just praises what he himself has come to know and see, while denounc￾ing and disparaging what others have come to know and see. 
And then,$Gotama, another renunciant or brahmin approaches [us] Kālāmas and also praises what he himself has come to know and see, while denounc￾ing and disparaging what others have come to know and see. 
Gotama,$having heard these, we have come to doubt: Which of these renunciants or brahmins is right, and which is wrong?$The World-honored One told them:$90^taisho438c Division 2$Kālāmas, do not doubt! Why? When there is doubt, hesitation arises.$Kālāmas, you yourselves do not have clear knowledge about whether there is a next life or whether there is no next life. 
Kālāmas, you your￾selves also do not have clear knowledge about what action is an offense and what action is not an offense. 
Kālāmas, you should know that all actions have three causes, sources, roots, causal conditions. 
What are the three?$Kālāmas, desire is a cause, a source, a root, a causal condition of actions. 
Kālāmas, hatred and ignorance are causes, sources, roots,$causal conditions of actions.$Kālāmas, someone who has desire becomes overwhelmed by desire; their mind is never satisfied. 
Such a one may kill living beings,$or take what is not given, or engage in sexual misconduct, or knowingly speak falsehood, or drink intoxicating liquor.$Kālāmas, someone who has hatred becomes overwhelmed by hatred; their mind is never satisfied. 
Such a one may kill living beings,$or take what is not given, or engage in sexual misconduct, or knowingly speak falsehood, or drink intoxicating liquor.$Kālāmas, someone who is ignorant becomes overwhelmed by ignorance; their mind is never satisfied. 
Such a one may kill living beings, or take what is not given, or engage in sexual misconduct, or knowingly speak falsehood, or drink intoxicating liquor.$Kālāmas, a learned noble disciple abstains from killing, gives up killing, discards blade and cudgel. 
He has shame and scruple, and a mind [full of] loving-kindness and compassion, [wishing to] benefit all [beings], including insects. 
He purifies his mind with regard to killing living beings.$Kālāmas, a learned noble disciple abstains from taking what is not given, gives up taking what is not given. 
He takes [only] what was given and delights in taking [only] what was given. 
He is always fond of generosity, rejoicing in it, without stinginess, and not expecting a reward. 
He purifies his mind with regard to taking what is not given.$Kālāmas, a learned noble disciple abstains from sexual activity, has given up sexual activity. 
He diligently practices celibacy, is energetic in$91^taisho439a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$this good conduct, pure, without blemish, having abandoned sensual desires, having given up sexual desires. 
He purifies his mind of sexual activity.$Kālāmas, a learned noble disciple abstains from false speech, has given up false speech. 
He speaks the truth, delights in the truth, is unshakably established in the truth, is completely trustworthy, and would not deceive [anyone in] the world. 
He purifies his mind with regard to false speech.$Kālāmas, a learned noble disciple abstains from divisive speech and abandons divisive speech. 
He does not engage in divisive speech and does not harm [the relationships of] others. 
Hearing something from this person he does not tell it to that person, in order to harm this person; hearing something from that person he does not tell it to this person, in order to harm that person. 
He has the wish to unite those that are divided, delighting in unity. 
He does not belong to any faction and does not delight in or praise factions. 
He has purified his mind with regard to divisive speech.$Kālāmas, a learned noble disciple abstains from harsh speech,$has given up harsh speech. 
He has given up the type of speech that consists of words that are rough and rude in tone, offensive words that grate on the ear, that people neither enjoy nor desire, that cause others suffering and vexation, and that are not conducive to concen￾tration. 
He speaks the type of speech that consists of words that are pure, peaceful, gentle, and beneficial, that are pleasant to the ear and enter the mind, that are enjoyable and desirable, that give others hap￾piness, words endowed with meaning, that do not make others afraid and that help others to attain concentration. 
He purifies his mind with regard to harsh speech.$Kālāmas, a learned noble disciple abstains from frivolous speech and abandons frivolous speech. 
He speaks at the [proper] time, speak￾ing what is true, what is Dharma, what is meaningful, what is calming,$delighting in speaking what is calming. 
[In regard to any] matter he teaches well and admonishes well, in accordance with the [proper]$time and in a proper way. 
He purifies his mind with regard to frivolous speech.$92$Division 2$Kālāmas, a learned noble disciple abstains from covetousness and abandons covetousness; his mind is not full of envy on seeing another’s wealth and lifestyle, he does not long for them, wishing: “If only I$could get that!” He purifies his mind with regard to covetousness.$Kālāmas, a learned noble disciple abstains from hatred and aban￾dons hatred; he has shame and scruple; his mind is full of loving-kind￾ness and compassion for the welfare of all beings, including insects.$He purifies his mind with regard to hatred.$Kālāmas, a learned noble disciple abstains from wrong view and abandons wrong view. 
He holds right view, view that is not distorted.$He has these views and makes these declarations:$There is offering, there is sacrifice, there are incantations; there are wholesome and unwholesome deeds, there are results of whole￾some or unwholesome deeds; there is this world and the other world, there are father and mother; there are True Persons in the world who are headed for a supreme attainment, who are well gone and well directed, who in this world and another world have$[attained] understanding and awakening by themselves, and dwell having personally realized it.$He purifies his mind with regard to wrong view.$In this manner, Kālāmas, a learned noble disciple achieves purity of bodily actions, achieves purity of verbal and mental actions. 
He aban￾dons ill will and quarrel, discards sloth and torpor, is without restlessness or conceit, and cuts off doubt; he transcends arrogance, has right mind￾fulness and right attentiveness, and is without confusion.$With a mind imbued with loving-kindness, he dwells pervading one direction, likewise the second, the third, and the fourth direction,$and also the four intermediate directions, above, and below, all around,$everywhere. 
With a mind imbued with loving-kindness, free from fetters and resentment, without ill will or quarrel, he dwells pervading the entire world [with a mind] boundless, exalted, immeasurable and well cultivated.$It is the same with compassion, empathic joy, and equanimity;$free from fetters and resentment, without ill will or quarrel, he dwells$93^taisho439b The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$pervading the entire world [with a mind] boundless, exalted, immeas￾urable and well cultivated.$In this way, Kālāmas, the mind of a learned noble disciple is free from fetters and resentment, without ill will or quarrel, and he obtains four assurances. 
What are the four?$[He thinks:]$[If] there is this world and another world, [if] there are results of wholesome and unwholesome actions, then upholding and being endowed with this right view and action in conformity with it, at the breaking up of the body, after my death, I will certainly go to a good realm of existence, be reborn in a heavenly realm.$Thus, Kālāmas, this is the first assurance obtained by a learned noble disciple whose mind is free from fetters and resentment, without ill will or quarrel. 
Again, Kālāmas, [he thinks:]$[If] there is neither this world nor another world, [if] there are no results of wholesome and unwholesome actions, then in this case,$in this lifetime I am not censured by others for this belief, but am praised for having right attentiveness, as one who is diligent and one who is said to have right view.$Thus, Kālāmas, this is the second assurance obtained by a learned noble disciple whose mind is free from fetters and resentment, without ill will or quarrel. 
Again, Kālāmas, [he thinks:]$Whatever I have done, I have certainly done no evil, and I recollect no evil. 
Why? Since I have done no evil, whence could suffering arise?$Thus, Kālāmas, this is the third assurance obtained by a learned noble disciple whose mind is free from fetters and resentment, without ill will or quarrel. 
Again, Kālāmas, [he thinks:]$Whatever I may have done, I have certainly done no evil, and I$have not violated the [customs of the] world, either out of fear or without fear; I have always had compassion and empathy for the$94$Division 2$entire world. 
My mind has been free of contention with beings,$untainted, and delighted.$Thus, Kālāmas, this is the fourth assurance obtained by a learned noble disciple whose mind is free from fetters and resentment, without ill will or quarrel. 
These, Kālāmas, are the four assurances obtained by a learned noble disciple whose mind is free from fetters and resentment,$without ill will or quarrel.$The Kālāmas[, repeating the teaching,] said to the World-honored One:$Indeed, Gotama, the mind of a learned noble disciple whose mind is free from fetters and resentment, without ill will or quarrel obtains four assurances. 
What are the four?$[If] there is this world and another world, [if] there are results of wholesome and unwholesome actions, then upholding and being endowed with this right view and with action in conformity with it, at the breaking up of the body, after my death, I will certainly go to a good realm of existence, and be reborn in a heavenly realm.$Thus, Gotama, this is the first assurance obtained by a learned noble disciple whose mind is free from fetters and resentment, without ill will or quarrel. 
Again, Gotama,$[If] there is neither this world nor another world, [if] there are no results of wholesome and unwholesome actions, then in this case,$in this lifetime, I am not censured by others for this belief, but am praised for having right attentiveness, as one who is diligent and is said to have right view.$Thus, Gotama, this is the second assurance obtained by a learned noble disciple whose mind is free from fetters and resentment, without ill will or quarrel. 
Again, Gotama,$Whatever I may have done, I have certainly done no evil, and I$recollect no evil.

Well-gone One, we have under￾stood it! World-honored One, we go for lifelong refuge to the Buddha,$the Dharma, and the community of monks. 
May the World-honored$One accept us as lay followers! From this day forth until life ends we go [to him] for refuge.$This is what the Buddha said. 
Having heard the Buddha’s words, all the people of Kālāma and the monks were delighted and remembered them well.$17. 
^ck The Discourse to$Gāmaṇi82$Thus have I heard: At one time, the Buddha was staying at Nālandā, in$Pāvārika’s mango grove.$At that time, [the seer] Asita Devala had a son named Gāmaṇi, who was of majestic complexion and build, radiant and bright. 
Just before dawn$[Gāmaṇi] approached the place where the Buddha was, paid homage at the$Buddha’s feet, and stood to one side.$Gāmaṇi, the son of Asita Devala, said:$World-honored One, brahmins arrogantly claim that they serve various gods, and that they can, at will, cause beings to reach a good realm of existence after death, to be reborn in a heavenly realm.

May the World-honored One cause people to reach a good realm of existence after death, to be reborn in a heavenly realm!$The World-honored One said:$Now, Gāmaṇi, I shall ask you something. 
Answer according to your understanding. 
What do you think, Gāmaṇi?

On being urged by that crowd of people who have come, placing their palms together, praising and imploring, because of this, conditioned by this, would that large heavy rock come out?$Gāmaṇi replied: “No, World-honored One.”$[The Buddha continued:]$So it is, Gāmaṇi.

This, Sīha, is the way in$104^taisho441c Division 2$which, according to the true Dharma, one would not misrepresent [me in saying]: “The renunciant Gotama’s doctrine is based on Dharma and Vinaya, and he proclaims to people a teaching of Dharma and$Vinaya.”$Sīha, what is the way in which, according to the true Dharma, one would not misrepresent [me in saying]: “The renunciant Gotama’s doc￾trine is based on asceticism, and he proclaims to people a teaching of asceticism”?$Sīha, there are renunciants and brahmins, who go naked and unclothed, who use their hands as clothes [to cover their private parts],$or use leaves as clothes, or use beads as clothes; who will not use a pot to get water, or will not use a ladle to get water; who will not eat food [obtained by others] by robbery with blade and cudgel; who will not eat food obtained by deception, or by personally approaching [a donor], or by sending a faithful follower [to get it], or [when called thus:] “Come, venerable sir!”, or “Very well, venerable sir!”, or “Stay,$venerable sir!”$Or [there are those] who, when two are eating together, will not eat with them; or who will not eat food from a house where there is a pregnant woman, or from a house where there is a pet dog; or who will not take food from a house where flies are buzzing around excrement;$or who do not eat fish, do not eat meat, do not drink alcohol, do not drink water [considered as] evil, or do not drink at all but train in the practice of not drinking; or who eat one mouthful and are content with one mouthful, or eat two mouthfuls, or three, four ...
or at most seven mouthfuls and are content with seven mouthfuls.$Or [there are those] who eat [only the alms] they obtain at a single$[house] and are content with what they obtain at a single [house], or at two [houses], or three, four ...
or at most seven [houses] and are content with what they obtain at seven [houses]; or who have one meal a day and are content with one meal, or one meal in two days, or in three, four, five, six, or in seven days, or in a fortnight, or who have one meal in a month and are content with one meal [in a month].$Or [there are those] who eat edible roots, or wild rice, or millet,$or rice bran, or rice scum, or coarse food; who go to secluded places$105^taisho442a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$and live off [what they find] in seclusion, or eat roots or eat fruits, or eat fallen fruits.$Or [there are those] who clothe themselves in patchwork robes, or in robes made of hair, or in robes made of coarse fabric, or in robes made of hair and coarse fabric; or who wear complete hides, or wear pierced hides, or wear complete pierced hides; who keep their hair disheveled,$or keep their hair in braids, or keep their hair disheveled and in braids,$or shave their hair, or shave their beard, or shave their hair and beard, or tear out their hair, or tear out their beard, or tear out their hair and beard.$Or [there are those] who stand continuously, abstaining from sitting;$or move about in a squatting position; or lie down on thorns, using a bed of thorns; or lie down on fruits, using a bed of fruits; or who worship water day and night, pouring it out with their hands; or who worship fire, keeping it burning continuously.$Or [there are those] who worship the sun and moon, revering them as spirits of great might, and saluting them with palms together. 
In these ways they experience untold suffering in the practice of self￾mortification. 
Sīha, there is such asceticism; I do not deny it.$But, Sīha, such asceticism is lowly action, leading to suffering,$leading to distress, a practice of worldlings; it is not the noble path.$[On the other hand,] Sīha, if there are renunciants and brahmins whose method of “asceticism” consists in knowing [defilements], abandoning them, [causing them] to cease completely, rooting them out and cutting them off, so that they will never arise again, then I proclaim this “asceti￾cism.”$Sīha, for the Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened,$the method of “asceticism” consisted in knowing [defilements], aban￾doning them, [causing them] to cease completely, rooting them out and cutting them off, so that they would never arise again. 
For this rea￾son I practiced “asceticism.” Sīha, this is the way in which, according to the true Dharma, one would not misrepresent [me in saying]: “The renunciant Gotama’s doctrine is based on asceticism, and he proclaims to people a teaching of asceticism.”$Again, Sīha, what is the way in which, according to the true$Dharma, one would not misrepresent [me in saying]: “The renunciant$106$Division 2$Gotama’s doctrine is based on not entering a womb [to be reborn], and he proclaims to people a teaching of not entering a womb”?$Sīha, if there are renunciants and brahmins who [through] higher knowledge abandon future rebirth in a womb, [causing future rebirth]$to cease completely, rooting it out and cutting it off, so that it will not arise again, I proclaim that they will [indeed] not enter a womb.$Sīha, the Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened,$[through] higher knowledge abandoned future rebirth in a womb, [caused future rebirth] to cease completely, rooted it out, and cut it off, so that it will not arise again. 
For this reason, I will not again enter a womb.$Sīha, this is a way in which, according to the true Dharma, one would not misrepresent [me in saying]: “The renunciant Gotama’s doc￾trine is based on not entering a womb [to be reborn], and he proclaims to people a teaching of not entering a womb.”$Again, Sīha, what is the way in which, according to the true$Dharma, one would not misrepresent [me in saying]: “The renunciant$Gotama’s doctrine is based on attaining peace, and he proclaims to people a teaching of attaining peace”?$Sīha, [I] attained fully the summit of the holy life, for the sake of which a clansman85 shaves off hair and beard, dons the yellow robe,$leaves home out of faith, and goes forth to practice the path.$In this very life I have personally attained understanding and awak￾ening, and I dwell having personally realized. 
I know as it really is:$“Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. 
There will not be another existence.”$Having attained peace myself, I bring peace to other monks, nuns,$laymen, and laywomen. 
Having brought peace to them, I bring liberation from birth to other living beings who are subject to birth, ...
subject to old age ...
subject to disease ...
subject to death ...
I bring liberation from sorrow, sadness, and defilements to other beings who are subject to sorrow, sadness, and defilements.$Sīha, this is the way in which, according to the True Dharma, one would not misrepresent [me in saying]: “The renunciant Gotama’s doc￾trine is based on attaining peace, and he proclaims to people a teaching of peace.”$107^taisho442b The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Senior Minister Sīha said to the World-honored One:$Gotama, I have known it! Well-gone One, I have understood it! Gotama,$it is as when someone with clear vision uncovers what was covered,$exposes what was covered, or shows the way to one who was lost, or offers a light in the darkness, so that those with eyes can see forms. 
In the same way, the renunciant Gotama has taught me the Dharma using countless skillful means to reveal its meaning in various ways.$World-honored One, I now go for refuge to the Buddha, the$Dharma, and the community of monks. 
May the World-honored One accept me as a lay follower! From this day forth until life ends I go [to him] for refuge.$World-honored One, just as a person who raises a bad horse,$expecting to get benefit from it, only tires himself and gets no bene-$fit—World-honored One, I was like this. 
Those foolish Nigaṇṭhas lack right knowledge; they do not know for themselves. 
Not recognizing the fertile field [of the Buddha’s teaching], and not examining for myself, [I] long revered them, made offerings, and paid them homage,$expecting to get benefit from it; but I only suffered in vain.$World-honored One, for a second time I now go for refuge to the$Buddha, the Dharma, and the community of monks. 
May the World￾honored One accept me as a lay follower! From this day forth until life ends I go [to him] for refuge.$World-honored One, I was formerly ignorant. 
Whatever faith and respect I had for those foolish Nigaṇṭhas has today been cut off. 
Why?$Because I was deceived. 
World-honored One, for a third time, I now go for refuge to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the community of monks.$May the World-honored One accept me as a lay follower! From this day forth until life ends I go [to him] for refuge.$This is what the Buddha said. 
Having heard the Buddha’s words, Senior$Minister Sīha and the monks were delighted and remembered them well.$19. 
^ck The Discourse to the$Nigaṇṭhas86$Thus have I heard: At one time, the Buddha was staying among the Sakyans,$in Devadaha.$108^taisho442c Division 2$There the World-honored One told the monks:$The Nigaṇṭhas hold this view and declare:$Whatever one experiences is caused by what was done in the past.$If past karma is eradicated through asceticism, and no new [karma]$is created, then all karma comes to cease; all karma having ceased,$the cessation of suffering is attained; the cessation of suffering being attained, the end of suffering is attained.$I therefore approached them, and on arriving, I asked:$Nigaṇṭhas, do you hold this view and declare: “Whatever one experiences is caused by what was done in the past. 
If past karma is eradicated through asceticism, and no new [karma] is created,$then all karma comes to cease; all karma having ceased, the ces￾sation of suffering is attained; the cessation of suffering being attained, the end of suffering is attained”?$They replied: “That is so, Gotama.” I also asked those Nigaṇṭhas:$Do you personally have clear knowledge that “I existed in the past,” or “I did not exist in the past”; “I did evil in the past,” or “I$did not do evil in the past”; “This much of the suffering that I cre￾ated has already been exhausted,” or “This much of the suffering that I created has not yet been exhausted,” or “When this has been exhausted, when its exhaustion is attained, then, by practicing, I$will realize in this lifetime the eradication of all unwholesome states and the attainment of manifold wholesome states”?$They replied: “No, Gotama.” I also said to those Nigaṇṭhas:$[You have affirmed that] you do not personally have clear knowl￾edge that “I existed in the past,” or “I did not exist in the past”; “I$did evil in the past,” or “I did not do evil in the past”; “This much of the suffering that I created has already been exhausted,” or$“This much of the suffering that I created has not been exhausted,”$or “When this has been exhausted, when its exhaustion is attained,$then, by practicing, I will realize in this lifetime the eradication$109$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$of all unwholesome states and the attainment of manifold whole￾some states.” How, then, can you claim: “Whatever one experiences is caused by what was done in the past. 
If past karma is eradicated through asceticism, and no new [karma] is created, then all karma comes to cease; all karma having ceased, the cessation of suffering is attained; the cessation of suffering being attained, the end of suffering is attained”?$Nigaṇṭhas, if you personally had clear knowledge that: “I$existed in the past,” or “I did not exist in the past”; “I did evil in the past,” or “I did not do evil in the past”; “This much of the suf￾fering that I created has already been exhausted,” or “This much of the suffering that I created has not been exhausted”; or “When this has been exhausted, when its exhaustion is attained, then, by practicing, I will realize in this lifetime the eradication of all unwholesome states and the attainment of manifold wholesome states,” then, Nigaṇṭhas, you could claim: “Whatever one expe￾riences is caused by what was done in the past. 
If past karma is eradicated through asceticism, and no new [karma] is created, all karma comes to cease; all karma having ceased, the cessation of suffering is attained; the cessation of suffering being attained, the end of suffering is attained.”$Nigaṇṭhas, suppose that a man’s body has been wounded by a poisoned arrow and, because of being wounded by this poisoned arrow, extreme pain arises. 
Then, out of sympathy and concern about the wound, his kinsmen and relatives call a surgeon to pull out the arrow, for his benefit and well-being. 
The surgeon comes,$and with a sharp knife cuts the wound open; and while the wound is being cut open, extreme pain arises again. 
Having cut the wound open, the surgeon probes for the metal arrowhead; and while he is probing for the arrowhead, extreme pain arises again. 
Having probed and found the arrowhead, he pulls it out; and while he is pulling it out, extreme pain arises again. 
Having pulled out the arrowhead,$he dresses and bandages the wound; and while he is bandaging it,$extreme pain arises again. 
After the arrowhead has been pulled out,$110^taisho443a Division 2$that man regains his vigor and feels well. 
Without any damage to his faculties, he recovers and is just as he was before.$Nigaṇṭhas, that man, personally having clear knowledge,$thinks: “Formerly I was wounded by a poisoned arrow, and because of that extreme pain arose. 
Then, out of sympathy and concern about the wound, my kinsmen and relatives called a surgeon to pull out the arrow, for the sake of my benefit and well-being. 
The surgeon came, and with a sharp knife cut the wound open; and while the wound was being cut open, extreme pain arose again.$Having cut the wound open, the surgeon probed for the metal arrowhead; and while he was probing for the arrowhead, extreme pain arose again.

After the arrowhead had been pulled out, I regained my vigor and felt well. 
Without any damage to my faculties, I recovered and was just as I had been before.”$In the same way, Nigaṇṭhas, if you personally had clear knowl￾edge that “I existed in the past,” or “I did not exist in the past”; “I$did evil in the past,” or “I did not do evil in the past”; “This much of the suffering that I created has already been exhausted,” or$“This much of the suffering that I created has not been exhausted”;$or “When this has been exhausted, when its exhaustion is attained,$then, by practicing, I will realize in this lifetime the eradication of all unwholesome states and the attainment of manifold whole￾some states,” then, Nigaṇṭhas, you could claim: “Whatever one experiences is caused by what was done in the past. 
If past karma is eradicated through asceticism, and no new [karma] is created,$all karma comes to cease; all karma having ceased, the cessation of suffering is attained; the cessation of suffering being attained,$the end of suffering is attained.” I asked them in this way, but I$did not see any of the Nigaṇṭhas able to answer me, saying:$“Gotama, it is so,” or “It is not so.”$111$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Again, I asked the Nigaṇṭhas: “If the Nigaṇṭhas [engage in] strong striving and strong asceticism, will at that time strong pain arise in the$Nigaṇṭhas?”$They replied: “Yes, Gotama.”$[The Buddha said:] “If the Nigaṇṭhas [engage in] middling striving and middling asceticism, will at that time middling pain arise in the$Nigaṇṭhas?”$They replied: “Yes, Gotama.”$[The Buddha said:] “If the Nigaṇṭhas [engage in] weak striving and weak asceticism, will at that time weak pain arise in the Nigaṇṭhas?”$They replied: “Yes, Gotama.”$[The Buddha said:]$That is to say, [when] the Nigaṇṭhas [engage in] strong striving and strong asceticism, at that time strong pain arises in the$Nigaṇṭhas; [when] they [engage in] middling striving and middling asceticism, at that time middling pain arises in the Nigaṇṭhas;$[when] they [engage in] weak striving and weak asceticism, at that time weak pain arises in the Nigaṇṭhas.$When the Nigaṇṭhas [engage in] strong striving and strong asceticism, at that time strong pain is calmed by the Nigaṇṭhas;$[when] they [engage in] middling striving and middling asceticism,$at that time middling pain is calmed by the Nigaṇṭhas; [when]$they [engage in] weak striving and weak asceticism, at that time weak pain is calmed by the Nigaṇṭhas.$Whether they act like this or do not act like this to calm that extreme pain, that great and heavy pain, it should be known that the Nigaṇṭhas are [simply] producing [their own] pain in the pres￾ent life.$But the Nigaṇṭhas are enveloped by ignorance, possessed by ignorance, saying: “Whatever one experiences is caused by what was done in the past. 
If past karma is eradicated through asceticism,$and no new [karma] is created, all karma comes to cease; all karma having ceased, the cessation of suffering is attained; the cessation of suffering being attained, the end of suffering is attained.”$112^taisho443b Division 2$I asked them in this way, but I did not find any Nigaṇṭha able to answer me, saying: “Gotama, it is so,” or “It is not so.”$I also asked the Nigaṇṭhas: “Nigaṇṭhas, if there is an action whose result is to be experienced as happiness, can that action, through striving and through asceticism, be turned into having suffering as its result?”$They replied: “No, Gotama.”$[I asked them further] “Nigaṇṭhas, if there is an action whose result is to be experienced as suffering, can that action, through striving and through asceticism, be turned into having happiness as its result?”$They replied: “No, Gotama.”$“Nigaṇṭhas, if there is an action whose result is to be experienced in this lifetime, can that action, through striving and through asceticism,$be turned into having its result in a later life?”$They replied: “No, Gotama.”$“Nigaṇṭhas, if there is an action whose result is to be experienced in a later life, can that action, through striving and through asceticism,$be turned into having its result in this lifetime?”$They replied: “No, Gotama.”$“Nigaṇṭhas, if there is an action whose result has not yet matured,$can that action, through striving and through asceticism, be turned into having its result matured?”$They replied: “No, Gotama.”$“Nigaṇṭhas, if there is an action whose result has matured, can that action, through striving and through asceticism, be made otherwise?”$They replied: “No, Gotama.”$[The Buddha said:]$That is to say, Nigaṇṭhas, an action whose result is to be experi￾enced as happiness, that action cannot, through striving and through asceticism, be turned into having suffering as its result.$Nigaṇṭhas, an action whose result is to be experienced as suf￾fering, that action cannot, through striving and through asceticism,$be turned into having happiness as its result.$Nigaṇṭhas, an action whose result is to be experienced in this lifetime, that action cannot, through striving and through asceticism,$be turned into having its result in a later life.$113$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Nigaṇṭhas, an action whose result is to be experienced in a later life, that action cannot, through striving and through asceti￾cism, be turned into having its result in this lifetime.$Nigaṇṭhas, an action whose result has not yet matured, that action cannot, through striving and through asceticism, be turned into having its result matured.$Nigaṇṭhas, an action whose result has matured, that action can￾not, through striving and through asceticism, be made otherwise.$Therefore, Nigaṇṭhas, your effort is in vain, your striving is empty and futile.$Then those Nigaṇṭhas told me: “Gotama, we have a venerable teacher,$named Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, who proclaims thus:”$Nigaṇṭhas, if you created evil karma in the past, then that karma can be completely extinguished by means of this asceticism. 
[And]$if you now restrain your body, speech, and mind, then through this [restraint] you will not create any further evil karma.$Again, I asked those Nigaṇṭhas: “Do you believe in [your] venerable teacher, the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, without having any doubts?”$They replied: “Gotama, we believe in [our] venerable teacher, the$Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, without having any doubts.”$Again, I said to those Nigaṇṭhas:$There are five things, which may have a twofold result in the pres￾ent life. 
They are: belief, liking, oral tradition, memory, and well￾considered view. 
Nigaṇṭhas, a person who himself says what is untrue, could [he regard that untrue statement] as believable, as likable, as traditional, as memorable, as a well-considered view?$They replied: “Yes, Gotama.”$Then I said further to those Nigaṇṭhas:$[But given that] it is an untrue statement, how could it be believable,$how could it be likable, how could it be traditional, how could it be memorable, how could it be well contemplated? [Yet] the person who himself says what is untrue has belief [in it], has liking [for$114^taisho443c Division 2$it], has heard [it as tradition], has memory [of it], has considered$[it] well.$[Monks,] if the Nigaṇṭhas speak thus, then they incur a fivefold censure according to the Dharma and can be reproached.$87 What are the five?$If all the pleasure and pain that these beings now experience is caused by actions done [in the past, then the Nigaṇṭhas [must] have done evil in the past. 
Why? Because that would be the reason why the$Nigaṇṭhas now experience extreme pain. 
This is the first [ground] on which the Nigaṇṭhas can be reproached.$Again, if all the pleasure and pain that beings experience is caused by the company they kept, then the Nigaṇṭhas [must] have kept evil company in the past. 
Why? Because that would be why the Nigaṇṭhas now experience extreme pain. 
This is the second [ground] on which the Nigaṇṭhas can be reproached.$Again, if all the pleasure and pain that beings experience is caused by destiny, then the Nigaṇṭhas [must] have had an evil destiny in the past. 
Why? Because that would be why the Nigaṇṭhas now experience extreme pain. 
This is the third [ground] on which the Nigaṇṭhas can be reproached.$Again, if all the pleasure and pain that beings experience is caused by views, then the Nigaṇṭhas [must] have held evil views in the past.$Why? Because that would be why the Nigaṇṭhas now experience extreme pain. 
This is the fourth [ground] on which the Nigaṇṭhas can be reproached.$Again, if all the pleasure and pain that beings experience is caused and created by a supreme god, then in the past the Nigaṇṭhas [must]$have been created by an evil supreme god. 
Why? Because that would be why the Nigaṇṭhas now experience extreme pain. 
This is the fifth$[ground] on which the Nigaṇṭhas can be reproached.$If in the past the Nigaṇṭhas did evil, ...
kept evil company, ...$had an evil destiny, ...
held evil views, [if there was] an evil supreme god and they were created by this evil supreme god; and if because of this the Nigaṇṭhas now experience extreme pain—then for these reasons,$on these grounds, the Nigaṇṭhas can be reproached.$115^taisho444a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$The Dharma, which I came to know by myself and realized by myself, and which I have proclaimed to you, cannot be refuted, cannot be defiled, cannot be prevailed over by any renunciant, brahmin, god,$Māra, Brahmā or anyone else in the world. 
Why is it that the Dharma,$which I came to know by myself and realized by myself, and which I$have proclaimed to you, cannot be refuted, cannot be defiled, cannot be prevailed over by any renunciant, brahmin, god, Māra, Brahmā or anyone else in the world?$If a monk abandons unwholesome bodily actions and practices wholesome bodily actions, [if he] abandons unwholesome verbal and mental actions and practices wholesome verbal and mental actions,$then in regard to future suffering [due to present unwholesome actions]$he personally knows: “there will be no [such] future suffering for me.”$In accordance with the Dharma he attains happiness and will not dis￾card it.$Aspiring to eliminate a [particular] cause of suffering, he may prac￾tice with [that] aspiration; or, aspiring to eliminate a [particular] cause of suffering, he may practice equanimity [in regard to that] aspiration.$If, aspiring to eliminate a [particular] cause of suffering, he practices with [that] aspiration; and if he then develops his practice with [that]$aspiration and eliminates that [particular cause of suffering], then the$[corresponding] suffering comes to be extinguished.$If, aspiring to eliminate a [particular] cause of suffering, he practices equanimity [in regard to that] aspiration; and if he then develops his practice with equanimity and eliminates that [particular cause of suf￾fering], then the [corresponding] suffering comes to be extinguished.$Then, the monk has this thought:$According to one’s behavior, according to one’s deeds, unwhole￾some states arise and wholesome states cease. 
If I eliminate my suffering for myself,$88 then unwholesome states will cease and wholesome states will arise. 
Now, I would better eliminate my suffering for myself.$Then he eliminates the suffering and, once the suffering has been elim￾inated, unwholesome states cease and wholesome states arise, and he$116$Division 2$no longer needs to eliminate suffering. 
Why? Because, monks, his orig￾inal purpose has been achieved, it is not the case that he might need to eliminate suffering again.$Monks, it is just as a fletcher may use a template to straighten an arrow, but once the arrow has been straightened, he has no further use for the template. 
Why? Because that person’s original purpose has been achieved, it is not the case that he might need to use the template again.$In the same way, a monk has this thought:$According to one’s behavior, according to one’s deeds unwhole￾some states arise and wholesome states cease.

And why? That man loves the woman,$is attached to her and has high regard for her; but then that woman instead gets talking with someone else, exchanges greetings with him,$and they go off to spend the night together. 
How could, because of this, physical and mental suffering, vexation, and extreme grief and sorrow not arise in that man?89$[The Buddha:]$Monks, suppose that man thinks like this:$117^taisho444b The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$I love that woman, and have high regard for her; but that woman instead got talking with another man, exchanged greetings with him, and they went off to spend the night together. 
Because of my suffering and sadness, shouldn’t I now rather cut off my love and attachment for that woman?$Then that man, because of his own suffering and sadness, cuts off his love and attachment for that woman. 
If that woman, as before, gets talk￾ing with someone else, exchanges greetings with him, and they go off to spend the night together, would again, because of that, physical and mental suffering, vexation, and extreme grief and sorrow arise in him?$The monks replied:$No, World-honored One.

Now, I would better seek to eliminate desire!$118$Division 2$So he seeks to eliminate desire [itself]. 
In order to eliminate that desire,$he dwells alone, in seclusion, resorting to a secluded place—to the base of a tree, to an empty and quiet place, a mountain top, a cave, [a place] in the open air, a heap of straw; or he goes into a forest, or to a cemetery.$Having resorted to a secluded place—to the base of a tree, to an empty and quiet place—he spreads his sitting mat, sits down cross￾legged, with upright body and upright intention, and sets up mindfulness before him.$He abandons covetousness, his mind is free from envy. 
Seeing another’s wealth and lifestyle, he does not give rise to thoughts of cov￾etousness: “If only I could get that!”$He purifies his mind of covetousness; and similarly of hatred, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry.$He abandons doubt and overcomes confusion; without hesitation in regard to wholesome states, he purifies his mind of doubt and confusion.$Having abandoned these five hindrances, which are imperfections of the mind that weaken wisdom, having abandoned desire, abandoned evil and unwholesome states, ...
(and so on up to) he dwells having attained the fourth absorption. 
When he has attained concentration in this way, his mind being purified, without blemish, free of vexations,$malleable, well established, having attained imperturbability, he directs his mind to the realization of the higher knowledge of the destruction of the taints.$He knows as it really is: “this is suffering”; he knows: “this is the origin of suffering”; he knows: “this is the cessation of suffering”; he knows as it really is: “this is the path to the cessation of suffering.”$Again, he knows as it really is: “these are the taints”; he knows: “this is the origin of the taints”; he knows: “this is the cessation of the taints”;$he knows as it really is: “this is the path to the cessation of the taints.”$Knowing thus, seeing thus, his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire, from the taint of existence, and from the taint of igno￾rance. 
Being liberated, he knows he is liberated. 
He understands as it really is: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done; there will not be another existence.”$119^taisho444c The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$The Tathāgata who has, in this way, rightly liberated the mind,$gains five kinds of praise, [praise that is] according to the Dharma,$undisputed, desirable, and highly regarded. 
What are the five?$If all the pleasure and pain that beings now experience is caused by deeds in the past, then the Tathāgata [must] have done sublime actions in the past; and because of that, the Tathāgata now experiences a noble happiness that is free of taints. 
Quiescent and calm, he has attained happiness and awakening. 
This is the first praise gained by the Tathāgata.$Again, if all the pleasure and pain that beings experience is caused by the company they have kept, then the Tathāgata [must have] kept good company in the past; and because of that, the Tathāgata now expe￾riences a noble happiness free of taints. 
Quiescent and calm, he has attained happiness and awakening. 
This is the second praise gained by the Tathāgata.$Again, if all the pleasure and pain that beings experience is caused by destiny, then the Tathāgata [must have] had a good destiny in the past; and because of that, the Tathāgata now experiences a noble hap￾piness free of taints. 
Quiescent and calm, he has attained happiness and awakening. 
This is the third praise gained by the Tathāgata.$Again, if all the pleasure and pain that beings experience is caused by holding views, then the Tathāgata [must have] held good views in the past; and because of that, the Tathāgata now experiences a noble happiness free of taints. 
Quiescent and calm, he has attained happiness and awakening. 
This is the fourth praise gained by the Tathāgata.$Again, if all the pleasure and pain that beings experience is caused and created by a supreme god, then the Tathāgata [must have been cre￾ated by] a good supreme god in the past; and because of that, the Tathā-$gata now experiences a noble happiness free of taints. 
Quiescent and calm, he has attained happiness and awakening. 
This is the fifth praise gained by the Tathāgata.$Thus, because of the Tathāgata’s former good actions, good com￾pany, good destiny, good view, and the existence of a good supreme god, the good supreme god by which the Tathāgata was created—$because of these the Tathāgata now experiences a noble happiness free$120^taisho445a Division 2$from taints, is quiescent and calm, having attained happiness and awak￾ening. 
For these reasons, the Tathāgata now gains five kinds of praise.$There are five causes and conditions owing to which sorrow and suffering arise in the mind. 
What are the five?$[The first is] entanglement in sexual desire; because of entangle￾ment in sexual desire, sorrow and suffering arise in the mind. 
Similarly entanglement in hatred, ...
sloth and torpor, ...
restlessness and worry,$entanglement in doubt; because of entanglement in doubt, sorrow and suffering arise in the mind. 
These are the five causes and conditions owing to which sorrow and suffering arise in the mind.$There are five causes and conditions owing to which sorrow and suffering disappear from the mind. 
What are the five? If one is entangled in sexual desire, and because of entanglement in sexual desire, sorrow and suffering have arisen in the mind, then on abandoning entanglement in sexual desire, the sorrow and suffering will cease. 
Owing to entan￾glement in sexual desire, sorrow and suffering have arisen in the mind;$but on attaining the goal in this lifetime, there is freedom from vexation and affliction, constantly present and unchanging, as is known to the noble ones and seen by the noble ones.$In the same way, if one is entangled in hatred ...
sloth and torpor$...
restlessness and worry ...
if one is entangled in doubt, and because of entanglement in doubt, sorrow and suffering have arisen in the mind,$then on abandoning entanglement in doubt, the sorrow and suffering will cease. 
Owing to entanglement in doubt, sorrow and suffering have arisen in the mind; but on attaining the goal in this lifetime, there is freedom from vexation and affliction, constantly present and unchang￾ing, as is known to the noble ones and seen by the noble ones. 
These are the five causes and conditions owing to which sorrow and suffering disappear from the mind.$Again, there is another attaining of the goal in this lifetime, which is free from vexation and affliction, constantly present and unchanging,$as is known to the noble ones and seen by the noble ones. 
What is that other attaining of the goal in this lifetime, which is free from vexation and affliction, constantly present and unchanging, as is known to the noble ones and seen by the noble ones? It is the noble eightfold path:$121$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$right view ...
(and so on up to) right concentration—these eight. 
This is another attaining of the goal in this lifetime, which is free from vex￾ation and affliction, constantly present and unchanging, as is known to the noble ones and seen by the noble ones.$This is what the Buddha said. 
Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.$20. 
^ck The Discourse to$Pāṭaliya90$Thus have I heard: At one time, the Buddha, who was wandering among the$Koliyans together with a great company of monks, arrived at the village of$Uttara and stayed in a rosewood grove north of Uttara.$At that time Pāṭaliya, the village headman, heard that the renunciant$Gotama, a son of the Sākya clan, who had abandoned his clan and family,$and had gone forth to train in the path, was wandering among the Koliyans together with a great company of monks, and that he had arrived at the village of Uttara and was staying in a rosewood grove north of Uttara. 
[He also heard that] the renunciant Gotama had a great reputation, which had spread in all the ten directions:$The renunciant Gotama is a Tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, a Well-gone One,$a knower of the world, an unsurpassed one, a trainer of those to be tamed, a teacher of gods and human beings, known as the Buddha, the$Fortunate One.$In this world, with its gods, Māras, Brahmās, renunciants, and brahmins, from human beings to gods, he has [attained] understanding and awakening by himself, and dwells having personally realized it.$The Dharma he teaches is good in the beginning, good in the middle,$and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, revealing a holy life endowed with purity.$If one visits such a Tathāgata, who is free from attachment and fully awakened, [if one] pays homage to him respectfully and serves him, then one will quickly get good rewards.$122^taisho445b Division 2$[Pāṭaliya] thought: “I should go to visit the renunciant Gotama and pay homage to him.”$Having learned this, Pāṭaliya the village headman left Uttara and went north toward the rosewood grove, wishing to visit the World-honored One and pay homage to him. 
From afar Pāṭaliya the village headman saw the$World-honored One among the trees of the grove, dignified and beautiful,$like the moon amidst the stars, with radiant aura, shining like a golden moun￾tain, endowed with handsome appearance and majestic dignity, with sense faculties calm, free of obstruction, accomplished and disciplined, with his mind calm and quiet.$Having seen the Buddha from afar, Pāṭaliya the village headman approached the Buddha, exchanged greetings, sat down to one side, and said to the World-honored One:$I have heard this: “The renunciant Gotama knows magic, he is a magi￾cian.”$Gotama, those who say: “The renunciant Gotama knows magic,$he is a magician,” are they not misrepresenting the renunciant Gotama?$Do they speak what is true? Do they speak what is Dharma? Do they speak the Dharma according to the Dharma? Do they not fall into error and incur censure according to the Dharma?$The World-honored One replied:$Headman, those who say: “The renunciant Gotama knows magic, he is a magician,”91 they are not misrepresenting the renunciant Gotama.$They speak what is true. 
They speak what is Dharma. 
They speak the$Dharma according to the Dharma. 
They do not fall into error or incur censure according to the Dharma. 
Why? Because, headman, I know the magic of others, though I myself am not a magician.$Pāṭaliya said:$Although what those renunciants and brahmins were saying is true,$yet I did not believe them when they said: “The renunciant Gotama knows magic, he is a magician.”$123$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$The World-honored One said: “Headman, if one knows magic, does one thereby become a magician?”$Pāṭaliya replied: “Indeed, World-honored One. 
Indeed, Well-gone One.”$The World-honored One said:$Headman, do not make a mistake and misrepresent me. 
If you misrep￾resent me, then you harm yourself, you will be criticized, you commit an offense, and you will be condemned by the noble ones for having perpetrated a major fault. 
Why? Because the truth is not in accordance with what you say. 
Headman, have you heard that the Koliyans have soldiers?$[Pāṭaliya] replied: “Yes, I have heard that.”$[The Buddha:] “What do you think, headman? Why do the Koliyans employ soldiers?”$[Pāṭaliya] replied: “To kill bandits, Gotama. 
For this reason the Koliyans employ soldiers.”$[The Buddha:] “What do you think, headman? Are the Koliyan soldiers virtuous or without virtue?”$[Pāṭaliya] replied:$Gotama, if in the world there are those who lack virtue, the Koliyan soldiers are certainly among them. 
Why? The Koliyan soldiers break all the precepts and behave in evil ways.$[The Buddha] asked further:$Headman, you see it thus and know it thus, and I do not question it.$[But] suppose that someone else were to ask you: “Headman Pāṭaliya,$you know that the Koliyan soldiers break all the precepts and do only evil; therefore, headman Pāṭaliya, you too break all the precepts and do only evil.” If someone were to speak like this, would he be speaking the truth?$[Pāṭaliya] replied:$No, Gotama. 
And why? The views of the Koliyan soldiers are different$[from mine], their desires are different, their aspirations are different.$124^taisho445c Division 2$The Koliyan soldiers break all the precepts and do only evil, but I keep all the precepts and do no evil.$[The Buddha] asked further:$Headman, you know that the Koliyan soldiers break all the precepts and do only evil, but you do not for this reason become one who breaks the precepts and does only evil.$Why, then, should it not be the case that the Tathāgata knows magic but is not himself a magician? How is that? I know magic, I know magicians, I know the results of doing magic, and I know the elimination of magic.$Headman, I also know killing of living beings, I know killers of living beings, I know the results of killing living beings, and I know the elimination of killing living beings. 
Headman, I know taking what is not given, I know those who take what is not given, I know the results of taking what is not given, and I know the elimination of taking what is not given. 
Headman, I know speaking falsehood, I know those who speak falsehood, I know the results of speaking falsehood, and I know the elimination of speaking falsehood.$Headman, I know this and see this. 
If someone says, “The renun￾ciant Gotama knows magic, he is a magician,” and if he does not give up saying that but makes known that state of mind, that desire, that aspiration, that report, that memory, and that reflection, then, when his life ends he shall, as quickly as one might bend or stretch out one’s arm, be reborn in hell.$On hearing this, Pāṭaliya the village headman was greatly afraid, trem￾bling, with his body hair standing on end. 
He immediately got up from his seat, paid homage at the [Buddha’s] feet with his head and, kneeling down with his palms placed together [in respect], said to the World-honored One:$I repent, Gotama. 
I confess, Well-gone One. 
I was like a fool, like an ignorant person, like an unstable person, like an unwholesome person.$And why? I was wrong in saying that the renunciant Gotama is a magi￾cian. 
May Gotama accept my repentance! I have seen my fault and dis￾closed it. 
Having repented, I shall exercise restraint and not do it again.$125^taisho446a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$The World-honored One told him:$So it is, headman. 
You truly were like a fool, ignorant, unstable and unwholesome. 
And why? You were wrong in saying that the Tathāgata,$who is free from attachment and fully awakened, is a magician. 
How￾ever, you have been able to repent. 
You have seen your fault and dis￾closed it. 
Exercising restraint, you will not do it again.$In this way, headman, those who are able to repent, who see their faults and disclose them, and who exercise restraint so as not to do it again, will grow in the noble Dharma and be free from fault.$Thereupon Pāṭaliya the village headman, his palms placed together [in respect] toward the Buddha, said to the World-honored One:$Gotama, there is one [type of] renunciants and brahmins who hold this view and declare: “If someone kills living beings, they will get the entire result in this lifetime; and because of that, sorrow and suf￾fering will arise. 
If someone takes what is not given, or speaks false￾hood, they will get the entire result in this lifetime; and because of that, sorrow and suffering will arise.” Renunciant Gotama, what do you think [of this]?$The World-honored One said:$Headman, I shall now ask you something; answer according to your understanding. 
What do you think, headman? In a village there may be a man who has garlands on his head and various perfumes applied to his body; singing, music, and dancing are performed for his entertain￾ment; and he is presented with courtesans to enjoy himself like a king.$Then someone asks: “What has this man done, that he now has garlands on his head and various perfumes applied to his body; that singing, music, and dancing are performed for his entertainment; and that he is presented with courtesans to enjoy himself like a king?”$Someone replies: “This man killed an enemy of the king, and the king, being delighted, bestowed rewards on him. 
For this reason this man has garlands on his head and various perfumes applied to his body;$singing, music, and dancing are performed for his entertainment; and he is presented with courtesans to enjoy himself like a king.”$126$Division 2$Headman, have you ever seen something like this, or heard of something like this?$[Pāṭaliya] replied: “Yes, Gotama, I have seen it, I have heard of it, and$I [expect I] will hear of it [again].”$[The Buddha continued:]$Headman, one may also see that a criminal is arrested by the king, his hands are bound behind him and, with a drum being beaten and the$[sentence] proclaimed, he is taken out through the southern gate of the town, seated beneath a tall signpost, beheaded, and his head is put on display.$Then someone asks: “What crime has this man committed that he is executed by the king?” Someone replies: “This man wrongly killed an innocent person from the king’s household. 
For this reason the king ordered this punishment.” Headman, have you ever seen something like this, or heard of something like this?$[Pāṭaliya] replied: “Yes, Gotama, I have seen it, I have heard of it, and$I [expect I] will hear of it [again].”$[The Buddha said:]$Headman, if a renunciant or brahmin holds this view and makes this proclamation: “If someone kills living beings, they will get the entire result in this lifetime; and because of that, sorrow and suffering will arise,” are they saying what is true or are they saying what is false?$[Pāṭaliya] replied: “It is falsely said, Gotama.”$[The Buddha:] “If they say what is false, would you have faith in them?”$[Pāṭaliya] replied: “No, I would not have faith, Gotama.”$The World-honored One praised him, saying: “Very good, headman!$Very good!”$[The Buddha] asked further:$What do you think, headman? In a village there may be a man who has garlands on his head and various perfumes applied to his body;$singing, music, and dancing are performed for his entertainment; and he is presented with courtesans to enjoy himself like a king.$127^taisho446b The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Then someone asks: “What has this man done, that he now has garlands on his head and various perfumes applied to his body; that singing, music, and dancing are performed for his entertainment; and that he is presented with courtesans to enjoy himself like a king?”$Someone replies: “In another country this man took what was not given [and the king, being pleased with him, bestowed rewards on him.] For this reason this man has garlands on his head and various perfumes applied to his body; singing, music, and dancing are performed for his entertainment; and he is presented with courtesans to enjoy himself like a king.”$Headman, have you ever seen something like this, or heard of something like this?$[Pāṭaliya] replied: “Yes, Gotama, I have seen it, I have heard of it, and$I [expect I] will hear of it [again].”$[The Buddha continued:]$Again, headman, one may also see that a criminal is arrested by the king, his hands are bound behind him and, with a drum being beaten and [the sentence] proclaimed, he is taken out through the southern gate of the town, seated beneath a tall signpost, beheaded, and his head is put on display.$Then someone asks: “What crime has this man committed that he is executed by the king?” Someone replies: “Within the king’s country this man took what was not given.

With lies he tried to deceive the king.$For this reason the king ordered this punishment.”$Headman, have you ever seen something like this, or heard of something like this?$129^taisho446c The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$He replied: “Yes, Gotama, I have seen it, I have heard of it, and I [expect$I] will hear of it [again].”$[The Buddha:]$Headman, what do you think—if a renunciant or brahmin holds this view and makes this proclamation: “If someone kills living beings,$they will get the entire result in this lifetime; and because of that, sorrow and suffering will arise,” are they saying what is true or are they saying what is false?$He replied: “It is falsely said, Gotama.”$“If they say what is false, would you have faith in them?”$He replied: “No, I would not have faith, Gotama.”$The World-honored One praised him, saying: “Very good, headman!$Very good!”$Then Pāṭaliya, the village headman, rose from his seat, arranged his clothes so as to bare one shoulder and, placing his palms together [in respect]$towards the Buddha, said to the World-honored One:$Marvelous! What Gotama has said is wonderful, with good analogies and good proof. 
Gotama, I built a high-roofed hall in the village of Uttara,$provided it with seats and beds, and set up water pots and big bright lamps. 
If diligent renunciants or brahmins come to stay in this high￾roofed hall, I provide what they need in accordance with my ability.$[Once] four teachers, holding different and opposing views were gathered in the high-roofed hall. 
Among them was one teacher who held this view and made this proclamation:$There is no offering, no sacrifice,$93 there are no incantations; no wholesome or unwholesome actions, no results of wholesome or unwholesome actions; there is neither this world nor another world,$there are no father and mother; there are no True Persons in the world who are headed for a supreme attainment, who are well gone and well directed, who have themselves known and realized this world and the other world, who have themselves directly real￾ized and accomplished it and dwell therein.$130$Division 2$The second teacher had right view. 
Opposing the view and knowledge of the first teacher, he held this view and made this proclamation:$There is offering, there is sacrifice, and there are incantations;$there are wholesome and unwholesome actions, and results of wholesome and unwholesome actions; there is this world and the other world, there are father and mother; there are True Persons in the world who are headed for a supreme attainment, who are well gone and well directed, who have themselves known and realized this world and the other world, who have themselves directly realized and accomplished it and dwell therein.$The third teacher held this view and made this proclamation:$One who acts or instructs another to act; one who destroys or instructs another to destroy; one who tortures or instructs another to torture, [causing] distress, vexation, sadness, beating of breasts,$despair, weeping, and bewilderment; one who kills living beings,$takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, speaks falsehood, drinks intoxicating liquor, breaks through walls to open storehouses, intrudes into others’ territory, destroys villages and towns, wipes out cities and countries—one who acts in these ways is not doing any evil.$Again, if by using an iron wheel as sharp as a razor, one were,$in a single day, to cut into parts and kill all the living beings on this earth, slicing them into pieces and turning them all into a single heap of flesh; this does not amout to “evil actions,” and the evil actions will not have results. 
If one were to go along the south￾ern bank of the Ganges killing, destroying, and torturing, and to come back along the northern bank of the Ganges making offerings,$undertaking sacrifices, and chanting incantations; then there is no offense and no merit because of this, there are no results of offense or merit because of this.$Making offerings, taming [oneself], guarding [oneself],$restraining [oneself], by esteeming, benefiting, generosity, speaking pleasantly, doing good, and sharing profit, one does not [earn]$merit because of this, there is no result of merit because of this.$131^taisho447a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$The fourth teacher had right view. 
Opposing the understanding and view of the third teacher, he held this view and made this proclamation:$One who acts or instructs another to act; one who destroys or instructs another to destroy; one who tortures or instructs another to torture, [causing] distress, vexation, and sadness, beating of breasts, despair, weeping, and bewilderment; one who kills living beings, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct,$speaks falsehood, drinks intoxicating liquor, breaks through walls to open storehouses, intrudes into others’territory, destroys villages and towns, wipes out cities and countries—one who acts in these ways is doing evil.$Again, if by using an iron wheel as sharp as a razor, one were,$in a single day, to cut into parts and kill all the living beings on this earth, slicing them into pieces and turning them all into a single heap of flesh, this does amount to “evil actions,” and these evil actions will have results.

Of these renunciants and brahmins, who isspeaking the truth, and who isspeaking falsehood?$The World-honored One told him:$Headman, do not let doubt arise in you. 
Why not? Owing to doubt, hes￾itation arises. 
Headman, you yourself do not have pure knowledge about whether there is a next life or no next life. 
Also, headman, you do not have pure knowledge regarding which way of acting is evil and which way of acting is wholesome. 
Headman, there is a Dharma meditation$132$Division 2$called abandoning. 
Through this meditation you may attain right mind￾fulness, you may attain one-pointedness of mind. 
In this way you may cut off your doubt in this lifetime and achieve progress.$Thereupon, Pāṭaliya the village headman rose again from his seat,$arranged his clothes so as to bare one shoulder and, placing his palms together$[in respect] towards the Buddha, said to the World-honored One:$Gotama, what is the Dharma meditation called abandoning, through which I may attain right mindfulness and may attain one-pointedness of mind, and in that way may cut off my doubt in this lifetime and achieve progress?$The World-honored One told him:$Headman, a learned noble disciple refrains from killing and abandons killing, abandons taking what is not given ...

sexual misconduct ...$false speech ...
(and so on up to) abandoned wrong view and attained right view.$Then he examines himself: “I have abandoned the ten unwholesome courses of action, and have been mindful of the ten wholesome courses of action.” When he sees these ten unwholesome courses of action abandoned within himself and is mindful of the ten wholesome courses of action, joy arises in him; joy having arisen, rapture arises; rapture having arisen, the body becomes calm; the body having become calm,$he experiences happiness with the body; the body having experienced happiness, he attains one-pointedness of mind.$Headman, a learned noble disciple who has attained one-pointed￾ness of mind, imbues his mind with loving-kindness and dwells [men￾tally] pervading one direction, likewise the second, the third, and the$133^taisho447b The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$fourth direction, also the four intermediate directions, above, and below,$all around, everywhere. 
With a mind imbued with loving-kindness,$free from fetters and resentment, without ill will or quarrel, he dwells pervading the entire world [with a mind that is] boundless, exalted,$immeasurable, and well cultivated.$Then he reflects thus: “There are renunciants and brahmins who hold this view and make this proclamation:”$There is no offering, no sacrifice, there are no incantations; no wholesome or unwholesome actions, no results of wholesome or unwholesome actions; there is neither this world nor another world,$there are no father and mother; there are no True Persons in the world who are headed for a supreme attainment, who are well gone and well directed, who have known and realized for them￾selves this world and the other world, who have themselves directly realized and accomplished it and dwell therein.$If those renunciants and brahmins are speaking the truth, then$I have offended against neither the fearful nor the fearless in the world.

After paying their respects to the$Buddha, they stood to one side and addressed him:$World-honored One, this past night Venerable Sāriputta has gathered with an assembly of monks at the assembly hall. 
He has explained to those monks the distinction between internal fetters and external fetters,$telling them: “Venerable friends, there truly are two categories of people to be found in the world: those who have [only] internal fetters and those who have [also] external fetters.” World-honored One, the assem￾bly is delighted [by his explanation].

^ck The Discourse on Perfecting the Precepts97$Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s$Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.$At that time, Venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks:$If a monk is accomplished in virtue, concentration, and wisdom, then it is certainly possible that he may, in this life, enter and emerge from the concentration of the cessation of perception and feeling. 
If he does not attain final knowledge within this life, then with the breaking up of the body at death, he will pass beyond the gods that feed on gross food and be reborn among the mind-made gods. 
Once he has been reborn there, it is certainly possible that he may enter and emerge from the concentration of the cessation of perception and feeling.$At that time, Venerable Udāyin was also present in the assembly. 
Ven￾erable Udāyin responded:$Venerable Sāriputta, if a monk is reborn among the mind-made gods,$it is certainly not possible that he may enter and emerge from the con￾centration of the cessation of perception and feeling.$A second and a third time Venerable Sāriputta told the monks:$If a monk is accomplished in virtue, concentration, and wisdom, then it is certainly possible that he may, in this life, enter and emerge from the concentration of the cessation of perception and feeling. 
If he does not attain final knowledge within this life, then with the breaking up of the body at death, he will pass beyond the gods that feed on gross food and be reborn among the mind-made gods. 
Once he is reborn there, it is certainly possible that he may enter and emerge from the concentration of the cessation of perception and feeling.$And a second and a third time Venerable Udāyin countered:$Venerable Sāriputta, if a monk is reborn among the mind-made gods,$then it is certainly not possible that he may enter and emerge from the concentration of the cessation of perception and feeling.$146$Division X$Thereupon, Venerable Sāriputta thought: “This monk has contradicted what I said three times now, and not a single monk [in this assembly] has com￾mended what I said. 
Perhaps I ought to approach the World-honored One.”$Then Venerable Sāriputta approached the Buddha. 
After paying homage,$he sat down to one side. 
Not long after Venerable Sāriputta had left [the assem￾bly that he had been teaching], Venerable Udāyin and the other monks also approached the Buddha. 
After paying homage, they sat down to one side.$In that situation, Venerable Sāriputta again addressed the monks:$If a monk is accomplished in virtue, concentration, and wisdom, then it is certainly possible that he may, in this life, enter and emerge from the concentration of the cessation of perception and feeling. 
If he does not attain final knowledge within this life, then with the breaking up of the body at death, he will pass beyond the gods that feed on gross food and be reborn among the mind-made gods. 
Once he is reborn there, it is certainly possible that he may enter and emerge from the concentration of the cessation of perception and feeling.$[And just as before,] Venerable Udāyin countered:$Venerable Sāriputta, if a monk is reborn among the mind-made gods,$then it is certainly not possible that he may enter and emerge from the concentration of the cessation of perception and feeling.$A second and a third time Venerable Sāriputta told the monks:$If a monk is accomplished in virtue, concentration, and wisdom, then it is certainly possible that he may, in this life, enter and emerge from the concentration of the cessation of perception and feeling.

I had better remain silent.”$Thereupon, the World-honored One asked: “Udāyin, would you say that the mind-made gods have form?”$Venerable Udāyin replied: “Yes, World-honored One.”$The World-honored One directly rebuked Udāyin: “You are a fool, blind,$without vision. 
On what grounds do you comment on this advanced topic in the Dharma?”$Thereupon, Venerable Udāyin, having been directly rebuked by the$Buddha, was sad and distressed. 
He lowered his head in silence, unable to reply, and seemed immersed in thought.$After having directly rebuked Venerable Udāyin, the World-honored$One addressed Venerable Ānanda:$A most highly regarded and virtuous elder monk has been [improperly]$contradicted. 
For what reason did you show disrespect by not inter￾vening? You too are a fool, with no loving-kindness, to turn your back on a most highly regarded and virtuous elder.$After having directly rebuked Venerable Udāyin and Venerable Ānanda,$the World-honored One addressed the monks:$If a monk is accomplished in virtue, concentration, and wisdom, then it is certainly possible that he may, in this life, enter and emerge from the concentration of the cessation of perception and feeling. 
If he does not attain final knowledge within this life, then with the breaking up of the body at death, he will pass beyond the gods that feed on gross food and be reborn among the mind-made gods. 
Once he is reborn there, it is certainly possible that he may enter and emerge from the concentration of the cessation of perception and feeling.$Having said this, the Buddha entered his meditation hut to meditate in$148$Division 3$silence. 
At that time, Venerable Baijing98 was in the assembly. 
Venerable$Ānanda spoke to Venerable Baijing:$I have been rebuked for something that another person did.

He will sit on a prepared seat in front of the assembly of monks and discuss this matter. 
May Venerable Bai￾jing respond regarding this matter! I am much [too] embarrassed and ashamed in front of the World-honored One and our companions in the holy life.$Then, in the late afternoon the World-honored One emerged from his meditation hut. 
He sat on a prepared seat in front of the assembly of monks.$He asked: “Baijing, for possessing how many qualities is a senior monk esteemed and revered by his companions in the holy life?”$Venerable Baijing replied:$World-honored One, a senior monk is esteemed and revered by his companions in the holy life if he possesses five qualities.$What are the five?

Why? Because, Kaḷārakhattiya, the monk Sāriputta has deeply comprehended the realm of thought.$Thisis what the Buddha said. 
Having heard the Buddha’s words, Venerable$Sāriputta and the other monks were delighted and remembered them well.$159^taisho452b The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$24. 
^ck The Discourse on the “Lion’s Roar”$of Sāriputta100$Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s$Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.$At that time, the World-honored One was accompanied by a great assem￾bly of monks, who were observing the rains retreat at Sāvatthī. 
Venerable$Sāriputta was also observing the rains retreat at Sāvatthī. 
At the end of the three-months’rains retreat at Sāvatthī, Venerable Sāriputta, having mended his robes, took his robes and bowl and approached the Buddha. 
Having paid homage at [the Buddha’s] feet, he sat down to one side and addressed him:$“World-honored One, I have completed the rains retreat at Sāvatthī, and now$I wish to journey among the people.”$The World-honored One replied:$Sāriputta, go as you please, so that you may deliver those who have not yet won deliverance, liberate those who have not yet attained lib￾eration, and [lead to] final nirvana those who have not yet achieved final nirvana. 
Sāriputta, go as you please.$Thereupon, Venerable Sāriputta, having heard what the Buddha said,$received and remembered it well, rose from his seat, paid homage at the$Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and returned to his quarters.$Having stored away his bedding and seat, he put on his robe and took his bowl and set out to journey among the people.$Not long after the venerable Sāriputta had left, a certain companion in the holy life [alleged], before the Buddha, a breach of the precepts, a con￾travention of the Dharma, saying to the World-honored One: “Venerable$Sāriputta slighted me today, just before he set out to journey among the peo￾ple.”$Hearing this, the World-honored One told one of the monks:$Go to Sāriputta and tell him: “The World-honored One calls you.

Not long after that monk had set out, Venerable Ānanda went, with keys in hand, to all of the [monks’] quarters. 
He told all the monks he encountered:$It would be good, venerable sirs, if you would come to the assembly hall right away. 
Venerable Sāriputta will soon roar a lion’s roar before the Buddha. 
It may be that Venerable Sāriputta will make a profound proclamation about that which is most peaceful and sublime. 
If he makes such a proclamation, you, venerable sirs, and I, having heard it, should later recite and memorize it well.$Then, on hearing what Venerable Ānanda said, all the monks went to the assembly hall. 
At that time, the monk [sent by the Buddha] approached$Venerable Sāriputta and said:$The World-honored One calls you.

A wise person who, on seeing him, is aroused to resentment ought to rid himself of it.$Venerable friends, if there is someone whose bodily actions are impure, but whose verbal actions are pure, how should a wise person who, on seeing him, is aroused to resentment rid himself [of that resentment]?$Venerable friends, suppose there is a forest-dwelling monk, a wearer of rag robes, who sees a discarded piece of cloth in a cesspool,$stained by excrement, urine, snot, spittle, and other impurities; and on seeing it, he holds it with his left hand, and spreads it out with his right hand; and wherever he sees portions that are not stained by excrement,$urine, snot, spittle, or other impurities, and that are without holes, he tears them off and takes them [to make a rag robe]. 
Similarly, venerable friends, if there is someone whose bodily actions are not pure, but whose verbal actions are pure, one should not pay attention to his impure bodily actions, but pay attention only to his pure verbal actions.$This is how a wise person who, on seeing [such an individual], is aroused to resentment ought to rid himself of [that resentment].$167$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Venerable friends, if there is someone whose verbal actions are impure, but whose bodily actions are pure, how should a wise person who, on seeing him, is aroused to resentment rid himself of it?$Venerable friends, suppose that, not far from a village, there is a deep pool [whose surface is] covered with water plants; and suppose that a man comes along who is oppressed by extreme heat, hunger,$thirst, and exhaustion, caused by a hot wind. 
On arriving at the pool,$he takes off his clothes, puts them on the bank, and enters the pool,$pushing aside the water plants with both hands. 
He enjoys a pleasant bath, and rids himself of the oppression by heat, hunger, thirst, and exhaustion.

This is how a wise person who, on seeing [such an individual], is aroused to resentment ought to rid himself of [that resentment].$Venerable friends, if there is someone whose bodily and verbal actions are both impure, but whose mind is pure to a small extent, how should a wise person who, on seeing him, is aroused to resentment rid himself of it?$Venerable friends, suppose that, at a crossroads, there is a puddle of water in the depression made by the hoof of an ox; and suppose that a man comes along who is oppressed by extreme heat, hunger, thirst,$and exhaustion, caused by a hot wind. 
He thinks to himself: “This ox’s hoof print at the crossroads contains a little water. 
If I were to scoop it up with my hand or with a leaf, the water would become muddied,$and I would not be able to rid myself of the oppression by heat, hunger,$thirst, and exhaustion. 
Let me kneel down, with hands and knees on the ground, and suck up the water directly with my mouth.” He then kneels down, with hands and knees on the ground, and sucks up the water directly with his mouth, and so is able to rid himself of the oppres￾sion by heat, hunger, thirst, and exhaustion.$Similarly, venerable friends, if there is someone whose bodily and verbal actions are impure, but whose mind is pure to a small extent,$one should not pay attention to his impure bodily and verbal actions,$168^taisho454b Division 3$but should pay attention only to his mind, which is pure to a small extent. 
Venerable friends, this is how a wise person who, on seeing$[such an individual], is aroused to resentment ought to rid himself of$[that resentment].$Venerable friends, if there is someone whose bodily, verbal, and mental actions are all impure, how should a wise person who, on seeing him, is aroused to resentment rid himself of it? Venerable friends, sup￾pose a person is on a long journey and, having become ill on the way,$is suffering greatly and exhausted. 
He is alone, without companion;$the village behind him is far away and the village ahead has not yet been reached. 
Suppose [also] that a second person comes along and,$standing to one side, looks at this first person, who is on a long journey and, having become ill on the way, is suffering greatly and exhausted—$alone, without companion, the village behind him far away and the village ahead not yet reached. 
And suppose that he helps [that sick trav￾eler] to get through the wilderness and reach the [next] village, and there gives him excellent medicine and good, sustaining food, caring for him well. 
In that case, that person’s illness would most certainly subside. 
That is to say, the second person is extremely compassionate toward the sick person, having a heart full of loving-kindness.$Similarly, venerable friends, if there is a person whose bodily, ver￾bal, and mental actions are all impure, then a wise person, on seeing him, thinks: “This person’s bodily, verbal, and mental actions are all impure; [but] let him not, on the breaking up of the body at death, go to a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell, as a consequence of his impure bodily, verbal, and mental actions. 
If this [impure] person encounters a good friend, [he may] give up his impure bodily, verbal,$and mental actions, and cultivate pure bodily, verbal, and mental actions.” In that case, through cultivating pure bodily, verbal, and mental actions, this [reformed] person will, on the breaking up of the body at death, go to a good realm of existence, be reborn in a heavenly realm. 
That is to say, this [wise] person is extremely compassionate toward that [impure] person, having a heart full of loving-kindness.$This is how a wise person who, on seeing [such an individual], is aroused to resentment ought to rid himself of [that resentment]. 
Venerable friends,$169^taisho454c The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$if there is a person whose bodily actions, verbal actions, and mental actions are all pure, how should a wise person who, on seeing him, is aroused to resentment rid himself of it?$Venerable friends, suppose that, not far from a village, there is a pool, full to the brim with clear, beautiful water, its banks covered with verdant grass, and surrounded by flowering trees; and suppose that a man comes along who is oppressed by extreme heat, hunger, thirst,$and exhaustion, caused by a hot wind. 
On arriving at the pool, he takes off his clothes, puts them on the bank, and enters the water. 
He enjoys a pleasant bath, and rids himself of the oppression by heat, hunger,$thirst, and exhaustion.$Similarly, venerable friends, if there is someone whose bodily, ver￾bal, and mental actions are all pure, then one should constantly pay attention to his pure bodily, verbal, and mental actions. 
This is how a wise person who, on seeing [such an individual], is aroused to resentment ought to rid himself of [that resentment]. 
Hereby, venerable friends, I$have explained the said five methods of overcoming resentment.$This is what Venerable Sāriputta said. 
Having heard it, the monks were delighted and remembered it well.$26.

^ck The Discourse to$Dhānañjāni105$Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha, in the$Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary, where he was observing the rains$176$Division 3$retreat together with a great assembly of monks. 
At that time, Venerable$Sāriputta was in Sāvatthī, also observing the rains retreat.$At that time a certain monk who, after having completed the three-month rains retreat at Rājagaha, and having mended his robes, put on his robe and took his bowl, and left Rājagaha for Sāvatthī, to stay in Jeta’s Grove,$Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
That monk approached Venerable Sāriputta and, having paid homage at his feet, sat down to one side.$Venerable Sāriputta asked: “Where have you come from, venerable friend? Where did you observe the rains retreat?”$The monk replied: “Venerable Sāriputta, I have come from Rājagaha. 
I$observed the rains retreat at Rājagaha.”$[Sāriputta] asked further:$Venerable friend, as for the World-honored One, who has been observ￾ing the rains retreat at Rājagaha, is he healthy and strong? Is he com￾fortable and free from ailments? Is he dwelling at ease, and is his vigor as usual?$The monk replied:$Yes, Venerable Sāriputta.

[However,] he does not wish to see the Buddha, nor does he delight in hearing the Dharma.$Why is that? Venerable Sāriputta, the brahmin Dhānañjāni has not been making efforts and has been transgressing against the moral pre￾cepts. 
Relying on his standing with the king, he defrauds the brahmins and householders; and relying on his standing with the brahmins and householders, he defrauds the king.$Hearing this, Venerable Sāriputta, having completed the three-month rains retreat at Sāvatthī and having mended his robes, put on his robe and took his bowl and left Sāvatthī for Rājagaha, where he stayed in the Bamboo$Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.$Then in the morning, after spending the night there, Venerable Sāriputta put on his robes, took his bowl, and went into Rājagaha to beg for food, going from door to door. 
Having begged for food, he went to the house of the brahmin$Dhānañjāni. 
At that time, the brahmin Dhānañjāni had come out of his house,$and was by the side of a spring, harshly punishing some local residents.$Seeing Venerable Sāriputta approaching in the distance, the brahmin$Dhānañjāni rose from his seat, bared his [right] shoulder, placing his palms together [in respect] toward Venerable Sāriputta, and expressed his joy: “Wel￾come, Sāriputta! It has been a long time since you came here, Sāriputta.”$Then, respectfully taking Venerable Sāriputta by the arm, the brahmin Dhā-$nañjāni led him into his house. 
He prepared a fine seat and invited Sāriputta to sit down. 
Venerable Sāriputta then sat on that seat. 
When the brahmin$Dhānañjāni saw that Venerable Sāriputta was seated, he brought him a golden bowl$106 to wash [his hands] and invited him to take a meal.$Venerable Sāriputta said: “Enough, enough, Dhānañjāni, put your mind at ease.”$179^taisho456c The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$A second and a third time the brahmin Dhānañjāni repeated his invitation,$and a second and a third time Venerable Sāriputta declined, saying: “Enough,$enough, Dhānañjāni, put your mind at ease.”$Then the brahmin Dhānañjāni asked: “Sāriputta, why enter the house like this and then refuse to eat?”$Venerable Sāriputta replied:$Dhānañjāni, [I hear that] you have not been making efforts and have been transgressing against the moral precepts. 
Relying on your standing with the king, you defraud the brahmins and householders, and relying on your standing with the brahmins and householders, you defraud the king.$The brahmin Dhānañjāni replied:$Sāriputta, know that, being at present a householder, I have to manage my household affairs. 
I have to see to my own comfort and well-being,$support my parents, look after my wife and children, provide for my male and female servants,$107 pay taxes to the king, perform rituals for the deities, make offerings to my departed ancestors, and give to renun￾ciants and brahmins—in order to live long and later be reborn in heaven and obtain pleasant karmic fruits.

Because thanks to you, we have well-being and happiness.” Dhā-$nañjāni, for one who is thus thought of fondly by renunciants and brah￾mins, merits increase daily and do not decline.$Thereupon, the brahmin Dhānañjāni rose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, placed his palms together [in respect] toward Venerable Sāriputta,$and said:$Sāriputta, I have a wife named Beautiful, whom I dote on. 
Through having been deluded by her, I have become negligent and undertaken many evil deeds. 
Sāriputta, from today onward, I will detach myself from my wife$Beautiful and [instead] take refuge in you, Venerable Sāriputta.$Venerable Sāriputta replied: “Dhānañjāni, do not take refuge in me. 
You should take refuge in the Buddha, in whom I myself take refuge.”$The brahmin Dhānañjāni proclaimed:$Venerable Sāriputta, from this day on, I take refuge in the Buddha,$the Dharma, and the community of monks. 
May Venerable Sāriputta$183^taisho457c The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$accept me as a lay follower of the Buddha, having taken refuge for life, until death.$Then Venerable Sāriputta taught the Dharma to the brahmin Dhānañjāni.$Exhorting, encouraging, and delighting him, Sāriputta employed countless skillful means to teach the Dharma. 
Having exhorted, encouraged, and delighted [Dhānañjāni], [Sāriputta] rose from his seat and left for Rājagaha.$After staying there several days, [Sāriputta] put on his robe and took his bowl and left Rājagaha for the Southern Mountains. 
He stayed in a rosewood grove, [located] north of a village in the Southern Mountains.$At that time, a certain monk who was staying at Rājagaha, after having stayed there for several days, put on his robe and took his bowl and [also]$left Rājagaha for the Southern Mountains. 
He [too] stayed in the rosewood grove, [located] north of a village in the Southern Mountains.$Then that monk approached Venerable Sāriputta and, having paid homage at his feet, sat down to one side.$Venerable Sāriputta asked: “Venerable friend, where have you come from? Where have you been staying?”$That monk replied: “Venerable Sāriputta, I have come from Rājagaha.$I was staying at Rājagaha.”$[Sāriputta] asked further: “Venerable friend, in Rājagaha there is a brah￾min named Dhānañjāni, a friend of mine from before I went forth as a monk.$Do you know him?”$The monk replied: “I know him.”$[Sāriputta] asked further:$Venerable friend, as for this brahmin Dhānañjāni who lives in Rājagaha,$is he healthy and strong? Is he comfortable and free from ailments? Is he dwelling at ease and is his vigor as usual? Does he wish to see the$Buddha often and does he delight in hearing the Dharma?$The monk replied:$Venerable Sāriputta, the brahmin Dhānañjāni wishes to see the Buddha often and he wishes to hear the Dharma often. 
However, he is not well and his vigor is diminishing. 
Why is that?$184$Division 3$Venerable Sāriputta, the brahmin Dhānañjāni is currently afflicted with an ailment. 
He is seriously ill and in a critical condition and there￾fore could die [soon].$Having heard this, Venerable Sāriputta put on his robe and took his bowl,$and left the Southern Mountains for Rājagaha, [where] he stayed in the Bam￾boo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.$Having passed the night there, at dawn Venerable Sāriputta, putting on his robe and taking his bowl, headed for the house of the brahmin Dhānañjāni.$Seeing Venerable Sāriputta approaching in the distance, the brahmin Dhānañjāni struggled to get up from his bed. 
Seeing the brahmin Dhānañjāni struggling to get up from his bed, Venerable Sāriputta stopped him, saying: “Lie still,$Dhānañjāni! Don’t get up! There is another bed here. 
I shall sit on it.”$Then, having seated himself on the other bed, Venerable Sāriputta asked:$“Dhānañjāni, how is your ailment now? How much are you eating and drink￾ing? Is your illness subsiding, not increasing?”$Dhānañjāni replied:$My ailment is becoming critical. 
I cannot eat or drink. 
My illness is increasing, not subsiding.$Venerable Sāriputta, I now have a headache so severe that it is as if a strong man were cutting my head open with a knife, causing extreme pain. 
Venerable Sāriputta, I now have a headache so severe that it is as if a strong man were constantly tightening a rope around my head,$causing extreme pain. 
Venerable Sāriputta, I now have stomach pains so severe that it is as if a butcher were cutting it open, like the stomach of a live cow, with a sharp knife, causing extreme pain. 
Venerable$Sāriputta, my entire body is in such pain that it is as if two strong men had seized a weak man and were roasting him over a fire, causing extreme pain. 
Such are the painful feelings I am experiencing; and they are increasing, not subsiding.$Venerable Sāriputta said:$Dhānañjāni, let me ask you a question. 
Answer as best you can. 
What do you think, brahmin Dhānañjāni? Which is the better, hell or the ani￾mal [realm]?$185^taisho458a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Dhānañjāni answered: “The animal [realm] is the better.”$[Sāriputta] asked further: “Dhānañjāni, which is the better, the animal$[realm] or the [realm] of hungry ghosts?”$Dhānañjāni answered: “The [realm] of hungry ghosts is the better.”$[Sāriputta] asked further: “Dhānañjāni, which is the better, the [realm]$of hungry ghosts or the [realm] of human beings?”$Dhānañjāni answered: “The [realm] of human beings is the better.”$[Sāriputta] asked further: “Dhānañjāni, which is the better, the [realm]$of human beings or the heaven of the four kings?”$Dhānañjāni answered: “The heaven of the kour kings is the better.”$[Sāriputta] asked further: “Dhānañjāni, which is the better, the heaven of the four kings or the heaven of the thirty-three?”$Dhānañjāni answered: “The heaven of the thirty-three is the better.”$[Sāriputta] asked further: “Dhānañjāni, which is the better, the heaven of the thirty-three or the Yama heaven?”$Dhānañjāni answered: “The Yama heaven is the better.”$[Sāriputta] asked further: “Dhānañjāni, which is the better, the Yama heaven or the Tusita heaven?”$Dhānañjāni answered: “The Tusita heaven is the better.”$[Sāriputta] asked further: “Dhānañjāni, which is the better, the Tusita heaven or [the heaven] of the gods who delight in creating?”$Dhānañjāni answered: “The heaven of the gods who delight in creating is the better.”$[Sāriputta] asked further: “Dhānañjāni, which is the better, the heaven of the gods who delight in creating or the [heaven] of the gods who wield power over others’ creations?”$Dhānañjāni answered: “The heaven of the gods who wield power over others’ creations is the better.”$[Sāriputta] asked further: “Dhānañjāni, which is the better, the heaven of the gods who wield power over others’ creations or the Brahmā world?”$Dhānañjāni answered: “The Brahmā world is supreme! The Brahmā$world is supreme!”$Venerable Sāriputta said:$Dhānañjāni, the World-honored One, who is endowed with knowledge and vision, the Tathāgata, without attachment and fully awakened, has$186$Division 3$taught four divine abidings. 
By practicing them again and again, a male or female lay follower can cut off sensual desire, relinquish thoughts related to sensual desire, and, with the breaking up of the body at death,$will be reborn in the Brahmā world. 
What are the four?$Dhānañjāni, here a learned noble disciple with his mind imbued with loving-kindness, dwells [mentally] pervading one direction, like￾wise the second, the third, and the fourth direction, and also the four intermediate directions and also above and below, all around, every￾where. 
With a mind imbued with loving-kindness, free from fetters or resentment, without ill will or quarrel, he dwells pervading the entire world [with a mind that is] boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well cultivated.$Similarly, he imbues his mind with compassion, with empathic joy, with equanimity, and, free from fetters or resentment, without ill will or quarrel, he dwells pervading the entire world [with a mind that is] boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well cultivated.$This, Dhānañjāni, is the teaching of the four divine abidings that has been taught by the World-honored One, who is endowed with knowledge and vision, the Tathāgata, without attachment and fully awakened. 
By practicing [these four divine abidings] again and again,$a male or female lay follower can eradicate sensual desire and relinquish thoughts related to sensual desire and, with the breaking up of the body at death, will be reborn in the Brahmā world.$Having taught Dhānañjāni the teachings relating to the Brahmā world,$Venerable Sāriputta rose from his seat and left.$After Venerable Sāriputta had left Rājagaha and before he had reached the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary, while he was still in between$[these two places], the brahmin Dhānañjāni, who had practiced the four divine abidings and had abandoned sensual desire and relinquished thoughts relating to sensual desire, with the breaking up of the body at death, was reborn in the Brahmā world.$At that time, the World-honored One was giving teachings, surrounded by an immense following. 
Seeing Venerable Sāriputta approaching in the distance, the World-honored One told the monks [in the assembly]:$187^taisho458b The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$The monk Sāriputta is endowed with bright wisdom, quick wisdom,$lively wisdom, keen wisdom, extensive wisdom, profound wisdom,$wisdom that brings release, penetrative wisdom, eloquent wisdom.$The monk Sāriputta has achieved genuine wisdom. 
This monk Sāriputta has just taught the brahmin Dhānañjāni a teaching on the Brahmā$world. 
If he had taught him further, [Dhānañjāni] would have quickly realized the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma.$Then, Venerable Sāriputta approached the Buddha and, having paid homage at his feet, sat down to one side.$The World-honored One said:$Sāriputta, why did you not teach the brahmin Dhānañjāni the teaching on going beyond the Brahmā world? If you had taught him further, he would have quickly realized the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma.$Venerable Sāriputta replied:$World-honored One, those brahmins have for a long time been attached to the Brahmā world, they delight in the Brahmā world, [take] the$Brahmā world to be supreme, esteem the Brahmā world, [take] the$Brahmā world to be [ultimately] real, and consider the Brahmā world as being for them. 
For these reasons, World-honored One, I acted according to [Dhānañjāni’s] wishes.$This is what the Buddha said. 
Having heard the Buddha’s words, Ven￾erable Sāriputta and the assembly of countless hundreds of thousands of people were delighted and remembered them well.$28. 
^ck The Discourse on Teaching the Ill [Anāthapiṇḍika]109$Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s$Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.$At that time, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was gravely ill. 
Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika spoke to a certain messenger:$Go to the Buddha and, on my behalf, pay homage at his feet. 
Inquire about his well-being, asking: “World-honored One, are you healthy$188^taisho458c Division 3$and strong? Are you comfortable and free from ailments? Are you dwelling at ease, and is your vigor as usual?” Then inform him: “The householder Anāthapiṇḍika pays homage at the World-honored One’s feet. 
He inquires about your well-being [with the words]: ‘World-hon￾ored One, are you healthy and strong? Are you comfortable and free from ailments? Are you dwelling at ease, and is your vigor as usual?’”$After you have, on my behalf, made these inquiries of the Buddha,$go to Venerable Sāriputta. 
Pay homage at his feet on my behalf, and inquire about his well-being by asking: “Venerable one, are you healthy and strong? Are you comfortable and free from ailments? Are you dwelling at ease, and is your vigor as usual?” Then inform him: “The householder Anāthapiṇḍika pays homage at the feet of Venerable$Sāriputta. 
He inquires about the venerable one’s well-being [with the words]: ‘Are you healthy and strong? Are you comfortable and free from ailments? Are you dwelling at ease, and is your vigor as usual?’”$[Then also tell him:] “Venerable Sāriputta, the householder Anātha￾piṇḍika is gravely ill and in a critical condition. 
The householder Anātha￾piṇḍika deeply wishes to see Venerable Sāriputta. 
But in his deteriorating physical condition, he is too weak to come and visit Venerable Sāriputta.$It would be good if Venerable Sāriputta, out of compassion, were to visit the householder Anāthapiṇḍika at his house.”$Then, having received the householder Anāthapiṇḍika’s order, the mes￾senger approached the Buddha. 
Having paid homage at his feet, he sat down to one side and said:$World-honored One, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika pays homage at your feet. 
He inquires about your well-being: “World-honored One,$are you healthy and strong? Are you comfortable and free from ail￾ments? Are you dwelling at ease, and is your vigor as usual?”$Then the World-honored One said to the messenger:$May the householder Anāthapiṇḍika find well-being and happiness.$May all gods, human beings, asuras, celestial musicians, demons, and all other forms of life find well-being and happiness!$189$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$The messenger heard what the Buddha said, and remembered it well.$Then, having paid homage at the Buddha’s feet and circumambulated him three times, he approached Venerable Sāriputta. 
Having paid homage at his feet, he sat down to one side and said:$Venerable Sāriputta, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika pays homage at$Venerable Sāriputta’s feet. 
He inquires about your well-being: “Ven￾erable one, are you healthy and strong? Are you comfortable and free from ailments? Are you dwelling at ease, and is your vigor as usual?”$[Also] “Venerable Sāriputta, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika is gravely ill and is in a critical condition.

It would be good if Venerable$Sāriputta, out of compassion, were to visit the householder$Anāthapiṇḍika at his house.”$Venerable Sāriputta consented by remaining silent. 
Then, understanding that Venerable Sāriputta had consented by remaining silent, the messenger rose from his seat, paid homage at [Sāriputta’s] feet, circumambulated him three times, and departed.$When the night was over, at dawn, Venerable Sāriputta put on his robe,$took his bowl, and approached the householder Anāthapiṇḍika’s house. 
Seeing$Venerable Sāriputta approaching in the distance, the householder$Anāthapiṇḍika struggled to raise himself from his bed.$Seeing the householder Anāthapiṇḍika struggling to raise himself from the bed, Venerable Sāriputta stopped him, saying: “Lie still, householder!$Don’t get up!

I shall sit on it.”$Then, having seated himself on the other bed, Venerable Sāriputta asked:$“How is your ailment now, householder? How much are you eating and drinking? Are your painful feelings subsiding, not increasing?”$The householder replied: “My ailment is becoming critical. 
I cannot eat or drink. 
My painful feelings are increasing, not subsiding.”$Venerable Sāriputta said:$Don’t be afraid, householder.

He raised himself into a sitting position on the bed, and praised$Venerable Sāriputta:$Very good! Very good! Your teaching of the Dharma to this sick man was marvelous, very special! Venerable Sāriputta, on hearing your$Dharma teaching for a sick man, my pain has been extinguished and happiness has been aroused. 
Venerable Sāriputta, my illness has now vanished and my condition has returned to normal.$Venerable Sāriputta, once, in the past, being in Rājagaha for some business or other, I stayed in the home of a householder there. 
At that time that householder was preparing to provide a meal for the Buddha$193^taisho459c The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$and the community of monks on the following day. 
When the night was far-gone and dawn was approaching, the householder called his children,$grandchildren, servants, and retainers, saying: “Get up! Quick! We must all prepare the meal.” Each received his or her instructions and together they set up the kitchen and began preparing all sorts of nourishing and delicious food and drinks. 
The householder personally set up a raised seat [for the Buddha], decorating it with countless adornments.$Venerable Sāriputta, on seeing this, I thought: “Is the householder preparing for a wedding? Is it to be a reception for a new daughter-in￾law? Or has the king been invited? Or some senior minister? Or is it for a great ritual offering of food?”$Venerable Sāriputta, having pondered in this way, I asked the householder, “Are you preparing for a wedding? Is it to be a reception for a new daughter-in-law? Or has the king been invited? Or some senior minister? Or is it for a great ritual offering of food?”$The householder replied: “We are not preparing for a wedding. 
It is not to be a reception for a new daughter-in-law. 
Neither has the king been invited, nor some senior minister. 
But it is indeed for a great ritual offering of food. 
We are providing a meal for the Buddha and the com￾munity of monks this coming day.”$Venerable Sāriputta, until then I had not heard the word “Buddha.”$When I heard it, my bodily hair stood on end. 
So I inquired: “House￾holder, you spoke of ‘the Buddha.’ Who is it that is called ‘the$Buddha’?”$Then the householder replied: “Have you not heard? There is a son of the Sakya clan who has relinquished his Sakyan family ties. 
He shaved off his hair and beard, donned yellow robe and, out of faith,$gave up the household life and became a homeless one, to train in the path. 
He attained perfect, supreme awakening; hence he is called$‘Buddha’ [Awakened One].”$I asked him further: “You also mentioned ‘the community.’What is this community?”$The householder again replied: “Members of various families and clans have [also] shaved off their hair and beards, donned the yel￾low robe and, out of faith, given up the household life and become$194$Division 3$homeless ones, to train in the Buddha’s path. 
These [monks] constitute his community. 
It is this Buddha and his community that we have invited.”$Venerable Sāriputta, I again asked the householder: “Where is the$World-honored One dwelling now? I desire to go and visit him.”$The householder replied: “The World-honored One is presently dwelling at Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.$You can go there if you wish.”$Venerable Sāriputta, I thought: “It will soon be daybreak. 
Let me quickly go and see the Buddha.” Venerable Sāriputta, my desire to go and see the Buddha being so pressing, although it was still night I sud￾denly had a perception of daytime brightness. 
So I set out from the householder’s home and went to the town gate. 
At that time, the town gate was guarded by two watchmen. 
One of the watchmen stood guard during the first half of the night, permitting people to enter without hindrance. 
The other stood guard during the second half of the night,$permitting people to leave without hindrance.$Venerable Sāriputta, I thought: “The night is not yet over. 
Why?$[Because] the town gate is [still being] guarded by [one of the] two watchmen. 
One of the watchmen stands guard during the first half of the night, permitting people to enter without hindrance. 
The other stands guard during the second half of the night, permitting people to leave without hindrance.”$Venerable Sāriputta, not long after I had passed out through the town gate, the [perception of daytime] brightness suddenly vanished and everything was dark again. 
Venerable Sāriputta, at that time I$became afraid and my bodily hair stood on end. 
[I thought]: “May no man or invisible being harm me!”$At that moment, a divine being at the city gate radiated forth a great radiance reaching from Rājagaha up to the Bamboo Grove, the$Squirrels’ Sanctuary. 
[That divine being] came and addressed me:$Don’t be afraid, householder! Don’t be afraid, householder! Why not? In a previous life I was a friend of yours, named Honey$Vessel.$110 We were very dear and close to each other in our youth.$195^taisho460a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Householder, in the past I had visited Venerable Mahā Moggallāna.$Having paid homage at his feet, I sat to one side. 
Venerable Mahā$Moggallāna gave me a teaching. 
He exhorted, encouraged, and delighted me, and by countless skillful means explained the$Dharma to me. 
Having exhorted, encouraged, and delighted me,$he let me take the three refuges and the five precepts. 
Householder,$for having taken the three refuges and kept the five precepts, with the breaking up of the body at death I was reborn in the heaven of the four great kings, and now reside at this town gate. 
Go quickly, householder! Go quickly, householder! It is better to go than to stay here.$To urge me onward, that divine being uttered the following verses:$Acquisition of a hundred horses, ministers, and women,$And of a hundred carts filled with gems$Is not equal to one-sixteenth [of the worth]$Of one step toward visiting the Buddha.$Even a hundred excellent white elephants,$With gold and silver saddles,$Are not equal to one-sixteenth [of the worth]$Of one step toward visiting the Buddha.$A hundred beautiful women,$Their bodies adorned with jewels and flowers,$Are not equal to one-sixteenth [of the worth]$Of one step toward visiting the Buddha.$The supremely precious woman treasure,$Adored by the wheel-turning monarch,$Is not equal to one-sixteenth [of the worth]$Of one step toward visiting the Buddha.$Having uttered these verses, the divine being urged me further, saying:$“Go quickly, householder! Go quickly, householder! It is better to go than to stay here.”$196^taisho460b Division 3$Venerable Sāriputta, I thought: “The Buddha is worthy of vener￾ation, and the Dharma and the community of monks are worthy of ven￾eration. 
Why? Even a divine being wishes me to go and visit them.”$Venerable Sāriputta, aided by the [divine being’s] radiance, I$reached the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. 
At that time, the night being over, toward dawn, the World-honored One had emerged from his meditation hut and was practicing walking meditation in the open, waiting for me. 
Venerable Sāriputta, in the distance I saw the$Buddha’s fine appearance, outstandingly radiant like a resplendent moon amidst the stars, dazzling like a golden mountain, endowed with the features [of a Great Person], majestic and imposing. 
His senses were tranquil and without obstruction, skillfully tamed and restrained,$his mind tranquil and still.$Seeing the Buddha, I was overjoyed and approached him. 
Having paid homage at his feet, I followed the Buddha in walking meditation.$In accordance with the custom of householders, I greeted him with this verse:$Has the World-honored One slept peacefully,$Having fallen asleep quickly?$[He replied:]$Like a [true] “brahmin,” I have attained deliverance,$Untainted by desires,$Having relinquished all yearning,$I have attained peace,$With all fevers of the mind removed.$[Consequently] I have slept well and happily.$Then, the World-honored One, having reached the end of the walking path, sat cross-legged on a prepared sitting mat. 
Venerable Sāriputta,$I [again] paid homage at his feet, and sat to one side. 
[Then] the World￾honored One taught me the Dharma, exhorting, encouraging, and delighting me, employing countless skillful means to explain it. 
He exhorted, inspired, and delighted me as he delivered the teaching of all the buddhas.$197$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$First he taught the beautiful Dharma that uplifts those who hear it, speaking on generosity, on virtue, on ways to rebirth in heavenly realms, on repudiating desire as dangerous, and on the round of rebirth as repugnant. 
He praised desirelessness as a factor of the sublime path,$and as purity. 
After expounding these teachings to me, the World-hon￾ored One knew that my mind was joyous, that it had become contented,$pliant, patient, uplifted, concentrated, free from doubt, free from hin￾drances, possessing the ability and strength to receive the true Dharma—$that is to say, the cardinal principles of the teachings of all the Buddhas.$The World-honored One taught me about suffering, its arising, its cessation, and the path [leading to its cessation]. 
As I sat there, Venerable$Sāriputta, I saw the four noble truths: suffering, its arising, its cessation,$and the path. 
Just as a white cloth easily absorbs dye, so did I [absorb the teaching]. 
As I sat there, I saw the four noble truths: suffering, its arising, its cessation, and the path.$Venerable Sāriputta, [in this way] I saw the Dharma, attained the$Dharma, awakened to the pure Dharma. 
Doubt was eradicated; confusion$[concerning the Dharma] was transcended. 
I would venerate no other$[teachers], never again follow others. 
I was without uncertainty, being established in realization of the fruit [of stream-entry]. 
In regard to the teachings of the World-honored One I attained freedom from vacillation.$Then I rose from my seat, paid homage to the Buddha, [and said]:$World-honored One, henceforth I take refuge in the Buddha, the$Dharma, and the community of monks. 
May the World-honored$One accept me as a lay follower. 
From today onward I take refuge for my whole life, until I die.$Then, Venerable Sāriputta, I placed my palms together and said: “World￾honored One, allow me to invite you and an assembly of monks to spend the rains retreat at Sāvatthī.”$Then the Buddha asked me: “What is your name? How do the people of Sāvatthī address you?”$I replied: “My name is Sudatta; but because I regularly assist and give to the needy and the orphaned, the people of Sāvatthī call me$Anāthapiṇḍika [Giver to the Needy and the Orphaned].”$198^taisho460c Division 3$Then, the World-honored One asked me further: “Are there dwellings [for monks] at Sāvatthī?”$I replied: “There are [at present] no dwellings [for monks] at$Sāvatthī.”$Then the World-honored One said: “Know, householder, that if there were dwellings [for them], monks would be able to visit and stay at [Sāvatthī].”$I then responded: “Indeed, World-honored One. 
I will have dwellings erected, so that monks can visit and stay at Sāvatthī. 
May the World￾honored One appoint someone to assist me!” And the World-honored$One appointed and sent [you], Venerable Sāriputta, to assist me.$Then, having heard what the Buddha said and kept it well in mind,$I rose from my seat, paid homage to the Buddha, and, having circum￾ambulated him three times, departed. 
Having completed what I had to do at Rājagaha, I set out for Sāvatthī, together with Venerable Sāriputta.$Without entering [the town of] Sāvatthī or returning to my home, we proceeded right away [to examine] the lands outside the city, [looking for] a location that had good access; that was not noisy in the daytime and was peaceful at night; that was without mosquitoes, gadflies, flies,$and fleas; and that was neither too cold nor too hot; [where] one could erect dwellings for the Buddha and his community.$Venerable Sāriputta, at that time we saw that Prince Jeta’s Grove was the only [location] that had good access; that was not noisy in the daytime and was peaceful at night; that was without mosquitoes, gad-$flies, flies, and fleas; and that was neither too cold nor too hot. 
Having seen this, I thought: “This is just the place where dwellings for the$Buddha and his community can be erected.”$Then, Venerable Sāriputta, I entered Sāvatthī. 
Still without return￾ing home, I first approached Prince Jeta, saying: “Prince, will you sell me this grove?” The prince replied: “Know this, elder!111 I will not sell the grove.” A second and a third time I repeated my request:$“Prince, will you sell me this grove?” And a second and a third time the prince replied: “I will not sell the grove, not even if you pay me millions and millions [of gold pieces, enough] to cover the entire sur￾face [of the grove].”$199^taisho461a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$I replied: “Prince, you have just set the price! I shall go and bring the gold.” Then, Venerable Sāriputta, the prince and I argued about whether or not he had set the price, and finally we approached the chief magistrate in Sāvatthī to settle the matter. 
The chief magistrate in$Sāvatthī said to Prince Jeta: “Prince, you have set the price. 
Now accept the gold!”$Then, Venerable Sāriputta, I returned to my home in Sāvatthī to fetch the cash. 
Elephants, horses, and carts were employed to transport it. 
Then the millions and millions of gold pieces were taken out [and used] to cover the ground [of the grove]. 
But a small portion of the ground was not covered.$Venerable Sāriputta, I thought: “From which of my other treasuries,$one that is neither too large nor too small, should I take, so that the remaining portion can be covered?”$Then Prince Jeta said to me: “Elder, if you have regrets, you can take back the payment and I shall keep the grove.”$I said to the prince: “I certainly have no regrets. 
I was merely thinking: From which of my other treasuries, one that is neither too large nor too small, should I take so that the remaining portion can be covered?”$Then Prince Jeta thought: “The Buddha must be most worthy of veneration, and the Dharma and the community of monks must also be most worthy of veneration. 
Why? [Because they] have moved this elder to make such a great offering, to spend his wealth in such a way.$I would now rather construct an enclosure with a gate on this [remaining piece of] ground and offer it to the Buddha and his community.”$Then Prince Jeta said to me: “Enough, elder! Don’t bring any more gold to cover this[remaining] piece of ground. 
Ishall construct an enclo￾sure with a gate here and offer it to the Buddha and his community.”$Venerable Sāriputta, out of compassion I gave this piece of ground to Prince Jeta. 
Venerable Sāriputta, in that very summer, I constructed$[in the grove] sixteen large dwelling places and sixty storerooms. 
Ven￾erable Sāriputta assisted me during that time.$[As for the present,] the Dharma talk that Venerable Sāriputta gave for this sick man was marvelous, very special. 
Having heard this$200$Division 3$Dharma talk delivered for a sick man, I am cured of that severe illness,$and am happy. 
Venerable Sāriputta, I have now recovered from my ill￾ness, and found peace and comfort. 
Venerable Sāriputta, accept a meal$[from me]!$Venerable Sāriputta consented by remaining silent. 
The householder$[Anāthapiṇḍika], having understood that Venerable Sāriputta had consented by remaining silent, rose from his seat, personally [brought] water for washing$[his hands], and offered various kinds of fine dishes, delicious, plentiful, and easy to digest. 
After the meal, he again brought the water container, and then seated himself on a small seat to one side to listen to the Dharma. 
Once$Anāthapiṇḍika was seated, Venerable Sāriputta expounded the Dharma to him, exhorting, encouraging, and delighting him, using countless skillful means to explain the Dharma. 
Having exhorted, inspired, and delighted$[Anāthapiṇḍika], [Sāriputta] rose from his seat and departed.$At that time, the World-honored One was giving teachings, surrounded by an immense following. 
Seeing Venerable Sāriputta approaching in the distance, the World-honored One told the monks [in the assembly]:$The monk Sāriputta is endowed with bright wisdom, quick wisdom,$lively wisdom, keen wisdom, extensive wisdom, profound wisdom,$wisdom that brings release, penetrative wisdom, eloquent wisdom.$The monk Sāriputta has achieved genuine wisdom. 
Why [do I say this]?$Regarding the four limbs of stream-entry taught in brief by me, the monk Sāriputta has elaborated on them with ten different explanations for the householder Anāthapiṇḍika.$This is what the Buddha said. 
Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.$29. 
^ck The Discourse by$Mahā Koṭṭhita112$Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha, in the$Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. 
At that time, in the late afternoon,$Venerable Sāriputta rose from sitting in meditation and approached Venerable$Mahā Koṭṭhita. 
Having exchanged courteous greetings, he sat down to one side.$201^taisho461b The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Venerable Sāriputta said to Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita: “I would like to ask you some questions. 
Would you care to hear them?”$Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita replied: “Venerable Sāriputta, ask whatever you wish. 
Having heard [your questions], I will [carefully] consider them.”$Venerable Sāriputta then asked:$Venerable friend Mahā Koṭṭhita, is there a condition owing to which a monk accomplishes view, acquires right view and, having attained unwavering pure [confidence] in the Dharma, arrives at the true Dharma?$[Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita] replied:$There is, Venerable Sāriputta.

^ck The Discourse with the Parable of the Elephant’s Footprint113$Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s$Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.$At that time, Venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks:$218$Division 3$Venerable friends, whatever countless wholesome states there are can all be subsumed under the four noble truths; they are all included in the four noble truths; the four noble truths are declared to be the foremost of all teachings. 
Why? Because they encompass all wholesome states.$Venerable friends, it is just as the elephant’s footprint is foremost among the footprints of all animals, because it is the greatest, the largest.$So too, venerable friends, the countless wholesome states are all sub￾sumed under the four noble truths; they are all included in the four noble truths; the four noble truths are declared to be the foremost of all teachings.$What are the four? They are: the noble truth of suffering, [the noble truth of] the arising of suffering, [the noble truth of] the cessation of suffering, and the noble truth of the path [leading to] the cessation of suffering. 
What, venerable friends, is the noble truth of suffering?$It is this: birth is suffering, old age is suffering, disease is suffering,$death is suffering, association with what is disliked is suffering, sep￾aration from what is loved is suffering, being unable to get what one wishes is suffering; in short, the five aggregates affected by clinging are suffering.$What, venerable friends, are the five aggregates affected by clinging,$[which are] suffering? They are: the material form aggregate affected by clinging; the feeling [aggregate affected by clinging]; the perception$[aggregate affected by clinging]; the formations [aggregate affected by clinging]; and the consciousness aggregate affected by clinging.$What, venerable friends, is the material form aggregate affected by clinging? It is whatever is corporeal, the four great elements and whatever is derived from the four great elements.$What, venerable friends, are the four great elements? They are the earth element, the water [element], the fire [element], and the air ele￾ment. 
What, venerable friends, is the earth element? There are, venerable friends, two kinds of earth element: there is the internal earth element and the external earth element.$What, venerable friends, is the internal earth element? Whatever internally, being inside the body, issolid and solidified, whatever isinter￾nally clung to. 
And what is that? It is: hair of the head, hair of the body,$219^taisho464c The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$nails, teeth, coarse and fine skin, flesh, sinews, bones, heart, kidneys,$liver, lungs,spleen, intestines,stomach, feces, or whatever else that exists in this body, is found inside it, that is solid, solidified, and is internally clung to. 
Venerable friends, this is called the internal earth element.$Venerable friends, as for the external earth element—great though it is, pure though it is, beyond reproach though it is—[yet], venerable friends, at times there is an inundation, and then the external earth ele￾ment disappears.$Venerable friends, this external earth element—great though it is,$pure though it is, beyond reproach though it is—is impermanent by nature, of a nature to be extinguished, of a nature to decay, changing by nature. 
How much more so this short-lived body that is clung to with craving! [Yet] the unlearned, deluded worldling thinks: “This is me,” “this is mine,” “I belong to this.” [On the other hand,] a learned noble disciple does not think: “This is me,” “this is mine,” “I belong to this.” How could he have such a thought? If people curse him, beat him, and become angry with him, he thinks: “This pain that I am expe￾riencing is born of causes and conditions; it is not without causes and conditions. 
What are the conditions? It is dependent on contact [to be experienced as] painful.”$He contemplates this contact as impermanent; and he contemplates feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness as impermanent.$Through [contemplation of] the elements, his mind remains still, one￾pointed, concentrated, and imperturbable. 
If, on a later occasion, other people come and address him with gentle phrases and soft words, he thinks:$This pleasure that I am experiencing is born of causes and condi￾tions, it is not without causes and conditions. 
What are the condi￾tions? It is dependent on contact [to be experienced as] pleasant.$He contemplates this contact as impermanent, and he contemplates feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness as impermanent.$Through [contemplation of] the elements, his mind remains still, one￾pointed, concentrated, and imperturbable. 
If, on a later occasion, some people, young, middle-aged, or old, come and subject him to various$220$Division 3$objectionable acts—perhaps punching him, stoning him, or harming him with blade or cudgel—then he thinks:$This body that I cling to is of a coarse material substance, derived from the four great elements, born of father and mother, maintained by food and drink, always requiring to be clothed, needing to sit or lie down, to be massaged and bathed, and to endure the worst.$[This body is] subject to breaking up, extinction, and dissolution.$It is because of this body that I am susceptible to being punched,$stoned, and harmed with blade or cudgel.$[Thinking] thus, [the noble disciple] exerts himself energetically without idleness, with upright body and right mindfulness, without forgetfulness and without delusion, his mind becoming one-pointed and concentrated.$He thinks:$I will not be neglectful. 
I will exert myself energetically without idleness, with upright body and right mindfulness, without for￾getfulness and without delusion, my mind having become one￾pointed and concentrated.

[Yet,] friends, when the external air element becomes still, people seek to make wind by using a fan, a palm frond, or a cloth.$Venerable friends, this external air element—great though it is,$pure though it is, beyond reproach though it is—is impermanent by nature, of a nature to be extinguished, of a nature to decay, changing by nature. 
How much more so this short-lived body that is clung to with craving!$[Yet] the unlearned, deluded worldling thinks: “This is me,” “this is mine,” “I belong to this.” [On the other hand,] a learned noble disciple does not think: “This is me,” “this is mine,” “I belong to this.” How could he have such a thought? If people curse him, beat him, and become angry with him, he thinks:$This pain that I am experiencing is born of causes and conditions;$it is not without causes and conditions. 
What are the conditions?$It is dependent on contact [to be experienced as] painful.$229$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$He contemplates this contact as impermanent; and he contemplates feel￾ing, perception, formations, and consciousness as impermanent. 
Through$[contemplation of] the elements, his mind remains still, one-pointed,$concentrated, and imperturbable. 
If, on a later occasion, other people come and address him with gentle phrases and soft words, he thinks:$This pleasure that I am experiencing is born of causes and condi￾tions, it is not without causes and conditions. 
What are the condi￾tions? It is dependent on contact [to be experienced as] pleasant.$He contemplates this contact as impermanent, and he contemplates feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness as impermanent.$Through [contemplation of] the elements, his mind remains still, one￾pointed, concentrated, and imperturbable.$If, on a later occasion, some people, young, middle-aged, or old,$come and subject him to various objectionable acts—perhaps punching him, stoning him, or harming him with blade or cudgel—then he thinks:$This body that I cling to is of a coarse material substance, derived from the four great elements, born of father and mother, maintained by food and drink, always requiring to be clothed, needing to sit or lie down, to be massaged and bathed, and to endure the worst.$[This body is] subject to breaking up, extinction, and dissolution.$It is because of this body that I am susceptible to being punched,$stoned, and harmed with blade or cudgel.$[Thinking] thus, [the noble disciple] exerts himself energetically, without idleness, with upright body and right mindfulness, without forgetfulness and without delusion, his mind becoming one-pointed and concentrated.$He thinks:$I will exert myself energetically, without idleness, with upright body and right mindfulness, without forgetfulness and without delusion, my mind having become one-pointed and concentrated.$This body to which I cling, let it be punched, stoned, and harmed by blade or cudgel, yet I shall energetically train in the teaching of the World-honored One.$230^taisho466c Division 3$Venerable friends, the World-honored One has given this teaching:$Suppose that bandits have come and are cutting your body limb from limb with a sharp saw. 
If, while those bandits are cutting your body limb from limb with a sharp saw, you were to have some change in your mind-state, or even utter evil words, then you would be failing and regressing [in your practice].$You should think thus:$If a bandit comes and cuts my body limb from limb with a sharp saw, there will not, because of that, be any change in my mind￾state, and I will not even utter evil words. 
I will arouse compassion toward the person who is cutting my body limb from limb.$For his sake I shall imbue my mind with loving-kindness and dwell [mentally] pervading one direction [with loving-kindness],$likewise the second, the third, and the fourth direction, and also the four intermediate directions, above, and below, all around,$everywhere. 
With a mind imbued with loving-kindness, free from fetters or resentment, without ill will or quarrel, I shall dwell per￾vading the entire world [with a mind that is] boundless, exalted,$immeasurable, and well cultivated.$Venerable friends, if that monk does not, through [recollecting] the$Buddha, the Dharma, and the monastic community, dwell in equanimity that is in harmony with what is wholesome, then, venerable friends,$this monk should feel embarrassed and ashamed, [thinking]:$As for benefits, I am without them; as for virtuous qualities, I am without them; for I do not dwell in equanimity that is in harmony with what is wholesome through [recollecting] the Buddha, the$Dharma, and the monastic community.$Venerable friends, just as a newlywed wife feels embarrassed and ashamed when she sees her in-laws or her husband, know that this monk is like that; he should feel embarrassed and ashamed [thinking]:$As for benefits, I am without them; as for virtuous qualities, I am without them, for I do not dwell in equanimity that is in harmony$231$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$with what is wholesome through [recollecting] the Buddha, the$Dharma, and the monastic community.$If, however, as a result of feeling embarrassed and ashamed, he [is then able to] dwell in equanimity that is in harmony with what is whole￾some, [thinking]: “This is excellent and peaceful, namely, the casting aside of all the process of existence, the abandoning of craving, dis￾passion, and complete cessation without remainder,” then, venerable friends, this monk is reckoned to have trained fully and abundantly.$Venerable friends, just as when a space is enclosed by timber, clay,$and reeds it comes to be termed a “house,” so too, venerable friends,$it is with this body: know that when a space is enclosed by sinews,$bones, skin, flesh, and blood it comes to be termed a “body.”$Venerable friends, if internally the eye sense base is not intact,$[and if] external forms are not illuminated by light, so that no awareness occurs, then eye consciousness does not come to arise.$Venerable friends, if [however,] internally the eye sense base is intact, [and if] external forms are illuminated by light so that awareness occurs, then eye consciousness comes to arise.$Venerable friends, the internal eye sense base and forms—[that is,] the external forms cognized by eye consciousness—belong to the material form aggregate. 
Any feeling [that thus] comes to be belongs to the feeling aggregate. 
Any perception [that thus] comes to be belongs to the perception aggregate. 
Any volitional formation [that thus] comes to be belongs to the volitional formations aggregate. 
Any consciousness$[that thus] comes to be belongs to the consciousness aggregate. 
This is how one contemplates the conjunction of the aggregates.$Venerable friends, the World-honored One has also given this teaching: “If one sees dependent origination, one sees the Dharma; if one sees the Dharma, one sees dependent origination.” Why?$Venerable friends, the World-honored One teaches that the five aggregates affected by clinging—the material form aggregate affected by clinging, the feeling [aggregate affected by clinging], the perception$[aggregate affected by clinging], the formations [aggregate affected by clinging], and the consciousness aggregate affected by clinging—$arise from causes and conditions.$232^taisho467a Division 3$Venerable friends, if internally the ear...

[One who contemplates this] becomes disenchanted with past, future, and present [manifestations of the] five aggregates affected by clinging. 
Being disenchanted, he becomes dis￾passionate. 
Through dispassion he becomes liberated. 
Being liberated,$he knows he is liberated, he knows as it really is: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done.$There will not be another existence.”$Venerable friends, such a monk is reckoned to have trained fully and abundantly.$This is what the venerable Sāriputta said. 
Having heard the venerable$Sāriputta’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.$233$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$31. 
^ck The Discourse on Discerning the Noble Truths116$Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s$Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.$At that time, the World-honored One addressed the monks:$This is the proper mode of teaching the Dharma, namely: to fully encompass the four noble truths, to fully examine them, analyze them,$reveal, exhibit, describe, and announce them, and to advance [under￾standing] of them.$Tathāgatas in the past, without attachment and fully awakened,$employed this proper mode of teaching the Dharma, namely: to fully encompass the four noble truths, to fully examine them, analyze them,$reveal, exhibit, describe, and announce them, and to advance [under￾standing] of them.$Tathāgatas in the future, without attachments and fully awakened,$will employ this proper mode of teaching the Dharma, namely: to fully encompass the four noble truths, to fully examine them, analyze them,$reveal, exhibit, describe, and announce them, and to advance [under￾standing] of them.$I, too, the Tathāgata of the present, without attachment and fully awakened, employ this proper mode of teaching the Dharma, namely:$to fully encompass the four noble truths, to fully examine them, analyze them, reveal, exhibit, describe, and announce them, and to advance$[understanding] of them.$The monk Sāriputta is endowed with bright wisdom, quick wisdom,$lively wisdom, keen wisdom, extensive wisdom, profound wisdom, wis￾dom that brings release, penetrative wisdom, eloquent wisdom. 
The monk Sāriputta has achieved genuine wisdom. 
Why [do I say this]?$Because after I teach the four noble truths in brief, the monk$Sāriputta is then able to explain them to others in detail, to fully encom￾pass them, to fully examine them, analyze them, reveal, exhibit,$describe, and announce them, and to advance [understanding] of them.$And when the monk Sāriputta teaches and explains in detail the four noble truths, analyzing them, revealing, exhibiting, describing,$234^taisho467b Division 3$and announcing them, and advancing [understanding] of them, he causes countless beings to gain insight [into them].$The monk Sāriputta is able to guide and train others through [estab￾lishing them in] right view, [while] the monk Moggallāna is able to establish them in the highest goal, namely the complete cessation of the taints. 
The monk Sāriputta is like a mother, “giving birth to” his companions in the holy life, [while] the monk Moggallāna is like a nurse, nurturing his companions in the holy life. 
For this reason, [their]$companions in the holy life should respect, honor, venerate, and pay homage to the monks Sāriputta and Moggallāna. 
Why? The monks$Sāriputta and Moggallāna seek to benefit their companions in the holy life, seek their well-being and happiness.$Having said this, the World-honored One rose from his seat and went into his dwelling to sit in meditation. 
Then, the venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks:$Venerable friends, the World-honored One has appeared in this world for our sake. 
He has widely taught and explained the four noble truths,$analyzed them, revealed, exhibited, described, and announced them,$and advanced [understanding] of them. 
What are the four? They are:$the noble truth of suffering, [the noble truth of] the arising of suffering,$[the noble truth of] the cessation of suffering, and the noble truth of the path [leading to] the cessation of suffering. 
What, venerable friends,$is the noble truth of suffering? Birth is suffering, old age is suffering,$disease is suffering, death is suffering, association with what is disliked is suffering, separation from what is loved is suffering, being unable to get what one wishes is suffering; in short, the five aggregates affected by clinging are suffering.$Venerable friends, [when] it is said, “birth is suffering,” on what basis is this said? Venerable friends, “birth” is when living beings, in their various forms, experience birth, when they are born, when they are brought into existence, when they are formed, when the five aggre￾gates come into being, and when the vital faculties develop—this is called birth. 
[As for] “birth is suffering”—venerable friends, when living beings are born, they experience physical pain, experience it$235^taisho467c The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$throughout, feel it, feel it throughout; they experience mental pain,$experience it throughout, feel it, feel it throughout; they experience physical and mental pain, experience it throughout, feel it, feel it through￾out.

Venerable friends, “old age” is when living beings in their various forms become senile, with hoary hair, lost teeth,$deteriorating health, hunched body, unsteady step, overweight body,$shortness of breath, reliance on a walking cane, shrinking flesh, sagging skin, wrinkles like pockmarks, failing sense faculties, and unsightly complexion.

Venerable friends, [when] it is said, “old age is suffering,” it is said on this basis.$236$Division 3$Venerable friends, [when] it is said, “disease is suffering,” on what basis is this said? Venerable friends, “disease” refers to headache, sore eyes, earache, sore nose, pain in the face, sore lips, toothache, pain in the tongue, pain in the palate, sore throat, panting, coughing, vomiting,$hoarseness, epilepsy, swelling, hypersalivation, bloody phlegm, fever,$emaciation, hemorrhoids, and diarrhea. 
When these and the various other symptoms of disease arise, they do so in dependence on contact.$They do not arise independently of the mind, [though] they manifest in the body.

Ven￾erable friends, [when] it is said, “disease is suffering,” it is said on this basis.$Venerable friends, [when] it is said, “death is suffering,” on what basis is this said? Venerable friends, “death” is when sentient beings,$in their various forms, come to the end of life and [succumb to] imper￾manence; when they die, disappear, break up, and are extinguished;$when their life span is ended, destroyed; when their vital force shuts down.

Venerable friends, with regard to “association with what is disliked,” living beings truly have six internal sense bases; and when, by way of the eye, ear, nose, tongue,$body, or mind, they sense an unliked object and find themselves together with it, in company with it, associated with it, conjoined with it, then they experience suffering. 
It is the same with the external sense objects,$and also with [the resulting] contact, feeling, perception, volition, and craving.$Venerable friends, living beings truly consist of the six elements;$and when, by way of the earth element, water [element], fire [element],$air [element], space [element], or consciousness element, they encounter an unliked object and find themselves together with it, in company with it, associated with it, conjoined with it, then they experience suf￾fering.

It will not break the bowl.”$Then the monkey carried the Buddha’s bowl away and went to a sāla tree. 
It slowly climbed the tree. 
Having reached the top of the sāla tree, it took some honey and filled the bowl with it. 
Coming slowly down from the tree, it returned and approached the Buddha.

My body is running down and my life span is coming to an end. 
I am in need of an attendant.All of you consider this and recom￾mend an attendant, one who will look after my daily needs appropriately and who will receive my instructions without losing their meaning.$Thereupon, Venerable Koṇḍañña rose from his seat, arranged his robe so as to bare one shoulder and, placing his palms together [in respect] toward the Buddha, said, “World-honored One, I wish to look after your daily needs appropriately and to receive your instructions without losing their meaning.”$The World-honored One said:$257^taisho472a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Koṇḍañña, you are old yourself.

Let me enter concentration such that I [can] survey the minds of the monks in the assembly.$Then Venerable Mahā Moggallāna entered concentration such that he$[could] survey the minds of the monks in the assembly. 
He then knew that$258^taisho472b Division 4$the World-honored One wished to have Venerable Ānanda as his attendant.$His intention was to choose Ānanda to look after his daily needs appropriately and receive his instructions without losing their meaning. 
Then Venerable$Mahā Moggallāna came out of concentration and told the monks in the assembly:$Venerable friends, did you know this? The World-honored One wishes to have Venerable Ānanda as his attendant. 
His intention is to choose$Ānanda to look after his daily needs appropriately and receive his instructions without losing their meaning. 
Venerable friends, we should now together approach Venerable Ānanda and persuade him to become the World-honored One’s attendant.$Then the venerable Mahā Moggallāna together with the other monks approached Venerable Ānanda. 
After exchanging courteous greetings, they sat down to one side. 
Then, having sat down, the venerable Mahā Moggallāna said:$Venerable Ānanda, did you know this? The Buddha wishes to have you as his attendant. 
His intention is to choose you to look after his daily needs appropriately and receive his instructions without losing their meaning.$Ānanda, it is as if there were, not far from a village, a gabled hall with a viewing tower and an open window facing toward the east; the sunlight at dawn would shine on its western wall. 
Similarly, friend$Ānanda, the World-honored One wishes to have you as his attendant.$His intention is: “May Ānanda look after my daily needs appropriately and receive my instructions without losing their meaning.” Friend Ānanda,$may you now become the attendant of the World-honored One!$Venerable Ānanda replied:$Venerable Mahā Moggallāna, I would not dare to become the attendant of the World-honored One. 
Why is that? Difficult indeed is it to attend on a buddha, a World-honored One, that is to say, to be his attendant.$Venerable Mahā Moggallāna, it is as if there were a great royal elephant,$full sixty years old, proud, powerful, with tusks intact and body full of vigor; difficult indeed is it to come close to him, that is to say, to be$259$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$his keeper. 
It is similar, Venerable Mahā Moggallāna, with a Tathāgata,$free from attachment and fully awakened; difficult indeed is it to come close to him, that is to say, to be his attendant. 
Venerable Mahā Mog￾gallāna, this is why I would not [dare to] become the attendant [of the$World-honored One].$Venerable Mahā Moggallāna replied:$Friend Ānanda, listen while I tell you a parable. 
The wise, on hearing a parable, understand its implication. 
Friend Ānanda, it is like the flower of the cluster fig tree, which appears in the world in due time.$Friend Ānanda, the Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened,$has likewise appeared in the world in due time. 
[Therefore], friend$Ānanda, quickly become the attendant of the World-honored One, and you, [Ānanda of the] Gotama [clan], will acquire great fruit.$Venerable Ānanda replied:$Venerable Mahā Moggallāna, if the World-honored One grants me three wishes, I will become the Buddha’s attendant. 
What are the three?$[First,] I wish not to wear robes, new or old, that [were given] to the$Buddha. 
[Second,] I wish not [to eat] food that was prepared specially for the Buddha. 
[Third,] I wish not to see the Buddha at inappropriate times.$Venerable Mahā Moggallāna, if the World-honored One grants me these three wishes, I will become the Buddha’s attendant.$Then, having persuaded Venerable Ānanda to become the Buddha’s attendant, Venerable Mahā Moggallāna rose from his seat, circumambulated$Venerable Ānanda, and returned. 
[He] approached the Buddha. 
After paying respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet and sitting down to one side, he said:$World-honored One, I have persuaded the venerable friend Ānanda to become the Buddha’s attendant. 
World-honored One, the venerable friend Ānanda asks that the Buddha grant him three wishes. 
What are the three? [First,] he wishes not to wear robes, new or old, that [were given] to the Buddha. 
[Second,] he wishes not [to eat] food that was$260^taisho472c Division 4$prepared specially for the Buddha. 
[Third,] he wishes not to see the$Buddha at inappropriate times. 
[Ānanda said to me:] “Venerable Mahā$Moggallāna, if the World-honored One grants me these three wishes,$I will become the Buddha’s attendant.”$The World-honored One said:$Mahā Moggallāna, the monk Ānanda is clever and wise. 
He foresees that there might be criticism from companions in the holy life, who might say, “The monk Ānanda attends on the World-honored One for the purpose of getting robes.”$Mahā Moggallāna, that the monk Ānanda is clever and wise and foresees that there might be criticism from companions in the holy life,$who might say, “The monk Ānanda attends on the World-honored One for the purpose of getting robes,” this is an extraordinary quality of the monk Ānanda.$Mahā Moggallāna, the monk Ānanda is clever and wise. 
He fore￾sees that there might be criticism from companions in the holy life,$who might say, “The monk Ānanda attends on the World-honored One for the purpose of getting food.”$Mahā Moggallāna, that the monk Ānanda is clever and wise and foresees that there might be criticism from companions in the holy life,$who might say, “The monk Ānanda attends on the World-honored One for the purpose of getting food,” this is an extraordinary quality of the monk Ānanda.$Mahā Moggallāna, the monk Ānanda is skillful in knowing the$[proper] time and in rightly discriminating the [proper] time. 
He knows when it is the proper time to visit the Tathāgata, and he knows when it is not the proper time to visit the Tathāgata; when it is the proper time for the assembly of monks or the assembly of nuns to visit the$Tathāgata, and when it is not the proper time for the assembly of monks or the assembly of nuns to visit the Tathāgata; when it is the proper time for the assembly of laymen and laywomen to visit the Tathāgata,$and when it is not the proper time for the assembly of laymen and lay￾women to visit the Tathāgata; when it is the proper time for the many non-Buddhist renunciants and brahmins to visit the Tathāgata, and$261^taisho473a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$when it is not the proper time for the many non-Buddhist renunciants and brahmins to visit the Tathāgata. 
He knows whether one of the many non-Buddhist renunciants or brahmins is able to discuss with the Tathā-$gata, or if one of the many non-Buddhist renunciants or brahmins is not able to discuss with the Tathāgata.$He knows which food, if eaten, savored, and digested by the Tathā-$gata, will bring him peace and well-being; and he knows which food,$if eaten, savored, and digested by the Tathāgata, will not bring him peace and well-being. 
He knows which food, if eaten, savored, and digested by the Tathāgata, will cause him to teach the Dharma more eloquently; and he knows which food, if eaten, savored, and digested by the Tathāgata, will not cause him to teach the Dharma more elo￾quently. 
This is said to be an extraordinary quality of the monk Ānanda.$Mahā Moggallāna, although the monk Ānanda does not possess the knowledge of others’minds, he knows well that the Buddha would rise from sitting in meditation in the late afternoon to teach people,$that such is the Tathāgata’s practice for today, or that such is the Tathā-$gata’s dwelling in happiness here and now. 
He speaks carefully, accord￾ing to what was said, speaking the truth and not otherwise. 
This is said to be an extraordinary quality of the monk Ānanda.$Venerable Ānanda has said, “Venerable friends, I have been attend￾ing on the Buddha for twenty-five years, [but] that I for that reason might become conceited, that is not the case.” That Venerable Ānanda$[is able to] make such a declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of the venerable Ānanda.$Venerable Ānanda has also said, “Venerable friends, I have been attending on the Buddha for twenty-five years and I have never gone to see him at an improper time.” That Venerable Ānanda [is able to]$make such a declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of the venerable Ānanda.$Venerable Ānanda has also said, “Venerable friends, I have been attending on the Buddha for twenty-five years and I have never been scolded by the Buddha, except on one occasion, which was on account of someone else.” That Venerable Ānanda [is able to] make such a dec￾laration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Ānanda.$262$Division 4$Venerable Ānanda has also said, “Venerable friends, I have received eighty thousand teachings from the Tathāgata and have memorized them without forgetting them, [but] that for that reason I might become conceited, that is not the case.” That Venerable Ānanda [is able to]$make such a declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of$Venerable Ānanda.$Venerable Ānanda has also said, “Venerable friends, I have received eighty thousand teachings from the Tathāgata, and since the beginning$I have never [needed to] ask [to hear them] again, except for one verse,$and that was not an easy [verse to understand].” That Venerable Ānanda$[is able to] make such a declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Ānanda.$Venerable Ānanda has also said, “Venerable friends, I have received eighty thousand teachings from the Tathāgata, and since the beginning$I have never looked to anyone else to receive teachings from.” That$Venerable Ānanda [is able to] make such a declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Ānanda.$Venerable Ānanda has also said, “Venerable friends, I have received eighty thousand teachings from the Tathāgata, and since the beginning$I have never had the thought: ‘I am receiving these teachings so that$I can teach them to others.’Venerable friends, I simply wished to dis￾cipline and calm myself in order to attain final nirvana.” That Venerable$Ānanda [is able to] make such a declaration, this is said to be an extraor￾dinary quality of Venerable Ānanda.$Venerable Ānanda has also said, “Venerable friends, it is most wonderful, most remarkable that the four assemblies come to me to listen to the Dharma, [but] that for that reason I might become conceited,$that is not the case. 
I do not even anticipate: ‘[If] they come and put a question, I shall answer like this and like this.’Rather, venerable friends,$when seated [to teach], I [reply] in accordance with the meaning and with what is proper.” That Venerable Ānanda [is able to] make such a declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable$Ānanda.$Venerable Ānanda has also said, “Venerable friends, it is most won￾derful, most remarkable, that when the many non-Buddhist renunciants$263^taisho473b The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$or brahmins come to ask me questions, it is not the case that I should harbor any fear or apprehension, or that my body hairs should stand on end. 
I do not even anticipate: ‘[If] they come and put a question, I shall answer like this and like this.’ Rather, venerable friends, when seated$[to teach], I [reply] in accordance with the meaning and with what is proper.” That Venerable Ānanda [is able to] make such a declaration,$this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Ānanda.$Again, at one time Venerable Sāriputta, Venerable Mahā Moggallāna,$and Venerable Ānanda were staying on Mount Salaḷāgāra at Sāvatthī.$123 At that time, Venerable Sāriputta asked [Ānanda], “Friend Ānanda, during the twenty-five years of your attending on the World-honored One, do you remem￾ber desire ever arising in your mind?”$Venerable Ānanda replied: “Venerable Sāriputta, I am [only] a disciple in higher training and have not abandoned desire.”$Venerable Sāriputta again said:$Friend Ānanda, I am not asking you if you are a disciple in higher training or one beyond training. 
Rather, I am asking you if you remem￾ber desire ever arising in your mind during the twenty-five years of your attending on the World-honored One.$Venerable Sāriputta repeated the question three times: “Friend Ānanda,$during the twenty-five years of your attending on the World-honored One,$do you remember desire ever arising in your mind?” And three times the venerable Ānanda gave the same answer: “Venerable Sāriputta, I am [only]$a disciple in higher training and have not abandoned desire.”$Venerable Sāriputta again said:$Friend Ānanda, I am not asking you if you are a disciple in higher training or one beyond training. 
Rather, I am asking you if you remem￾ber desire ever arising in your mind during the twenty-five years of your attending on the World-honored One.$Then Venerable Mahā Moggallāna said: “Friend Ānanda, answer the question right away! Answer the question right away! Do not trouble the most highly regarded elder.”$264^taisho473c Division 4$Then, Venerable Ānanda replied:$Venerable Sāriputta, from the beginning of the twenty-five years of my attending on the World-honored One I do not remember desire ever arising in my mind. 
Why is that? [Because] I always had shame and scruple when approaching the Buddha and my wise companions in the holy life.$That Venerable Ānanda [is able to] make such a declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Ānanda.$Again, at one time the World-honored One was staying on Mount Vulture$Peak near Rājagaha.At that time, the World-honored One told Ānanda: “Ānanda,$when you lie down, you should practice the lion’s way of lying down.”$Venerable Ānanda responded: “World-honored One, what is the way of lying down of the lion, king of animals?”$The World-honored One replied:$Ānanda, the lion, king of animals, after searching for food during the day, enters a cave to sleep. 
When it wants to sleep, it puts one leg on the other with tail stretched behind and lies down on its right side. 
In the morning, when the night is over, it inspects its own body. 
If the lion, king of animals, sees that its body is not straight, then it is not happy. 
If the lion, king of animals, sees that its body is straight, then it is happy. 
After rising from lying down, it goes out of the cave and growls several times. 
Having growled several times, it inspects its own body again. 
Having inspected its own body, it looks around to the four directions. 
Having looked around to the four directions, it roars three times and then goes out to search for food. 
Such is the way of lying down of the lion, king of animals.$Then the venerable Ānanda said: “World-honored One, if such is the way of lying down of the lion, king of animals, what is a monk’s way of lying down?”$The World-honored One replied:$Ānanda, when a monk is living in dependence on a village or town, in the early morning, when the night is over, he puts on his robes, takes$265$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$his almsbowl, and then enters the village to beg for food, with his body well protected, his senses guarded, and right mindfulness established.$Having finished begging for food in the village or town, [and eaten his meal], he puts away his robes and bowl, washes his hands and feet,$and then goes to a secluded place, taking a sitting mat with him on his shoulder.$He walks or sits in meditation under a tree or in an empty hut,$purifying the mind of any hindrance. 
Having spent the day practicing walking or sitting meditation to purify the mind of any hindrance, in the first watch of the night he again practices walking or sitting med￾itation to purify the mind of any hindrance.$Having practiced walking or sitting meditation to purify the mind of any hindrance during the first watch of the night, in the middle watch of the night he enters a hut to sleep. 
He folds his upper robe in four and places it on the bed, and he folds his outer robe to make a pillow.$He lies down on his right side, placing one leg on the other, con￾stantly maintaining clarity of perception, right mindfulness, and right attentiveness in his mind, and continuously aware of the thought of getting up [at the proper time].$In the last watch of the night, he gets up to practice walking or sitting meditation to purify the mind from any hindrance. 
This is how a monk lies down according to the way of the lion.$Venerable Ānanda said: “World-honored One, this is [indeed] how a monk lies down according to the way of the lion.” Venerable Ānanda [later]$used to say:$Venerable friends, from the time the World-honored One taught me the analogy of the lion’s way of lying down, I have never slept on my left side.$That Venerable Ānanda [is able to] make such a declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Ānanda.$Again, at one time the World-honored One was staying in the sāla tree grove of the Kusināra Mallas, called Upavattana. 
At that time the World￾honored One, who was about to attain final nirvana, said:$266^taisho474a Division 4$Ānanda, go to the place between the twin sāla trees and arrange a bed for the Tathāgata, with the head facing north. 
The Tathāgata will attain final nirvana during the middle watch of the night.$Having received the Tathāgata’s instruction, Venerable Ānanda went to the twin [sāla] trees. 
Between the twin trees, [he] arranged a bed for the$Tathāgata, with the head facing north. 
Having arranged the bed, [he] returned to the Buddha, paid respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet, stood to one side, and said:$World-honored One, I have arranged a bed for the Tathāgata, between the twin [sāla] trees with the head facing north. 
May the World-honored$One himself know the proper time.$Then the World-honored One bade Venerable Ānanda take him to [the place] between the twin sāla trees. 
[The Buddha] folded his upper robe in four, spread it on the bed, folded his outer robe to make a pillow, and then lay down on his right side with one foot on the other.$In the last moments [before] the Buddha’s final nirvana Venerable$Ānanda, who had been attending on the Buddha [standing behind him] with a fly whisk in hand, was wiping away tears with his hand, thinking:$Formerly assemblies of monks from all directions came, wishing to see the World-honored One, serve him, and pay respect to him. 
All of them could, at any time, see the World-honored One, serve him, and pay respect to him. 
But when they hear that the World-honored One has attained final nirvana, they will no longer come to see the World￾honored One, serve him, and pay respect to him. 
And I too will no longer be able to see the Buddha at any time, to serve him, and pay respect to him.$Then the World-honored One asked the monks, “Where is the monk$Ānanda now?”$The monks said:$World-honored One, Venerable Ānanda, who is attending on the$Buddha [standing behind you] with a fly whisk in hand, is wiping away tears with his hand, thinking, “Formerly assemblies of monks$267$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$from all directions came, wishing to see the World-honored One, serve him, and pay respect to him. 
All of them could, at any time, see the$World-honored One, serve him, and pay respect to him. 
But when they hear that the World-honored One has attained final nirvana, they will no longer come to see the World-honored One, serve him, and pay respect to him. 
And I too will no longer be able to see the Buddha at any time, to serve him, and pay respect to him.”$Then the World-honored One said:$Ānanda! Do not weep! Do not grieve! Why is that? Ānanda, you have attended on me respectfully, practicing loving-kindness in your bodily action, speech, and thoughts wholeheartedly from the beginning, and you have ensured my happiness and comfort without measure, without boundary, without limit.$Ānanda, as for Tathāgatas of the past, free from attachment and fully awakened, [whatever] attendants they had, none of them surpassed you.$Ānanda, as for Tathāgatas of the future, free from attachment and fully awakened, [whatever] attendants they will have, none of them will surpass you. 
Ānanda, as for myself, the Tathāgata of the present,$free from attachment and fully awakened, [whatever] attendants I have had, none of them has surpassed you.$Why is that? [Because you,] Ānanda, are skillful in knowing the$[proper] time and in rightly discriminating the [proper] time. 
You know when it is the proper time to visit the Tathāgata and you know when it is not the proper time to visit the Tathāgata; when it is the proper time for the assembly of monks or the assembly of nuns to visit the$Tathāgata and when it is not the proper time for the assembly of monks or the assembly of nuns to visit the Tathāgata; when it is the proper time for the assembly of laymen and laywomen to visit the Tathāgata and when it is not the proper time for the assembly of laymen and lay￾women to visit the Tathāgata; when it is the proper time for the many non-Buddhist renunciants and brahmins to visit the Tathāgata and when it is not the proper time for the many non-Buddhist renunciants and brahmins to visit the Tathāgata.$268^taisho474b Division 4$You know whether one of the many non-Buddhist renunciants or brahmins is able to discuss with the Tathāgata, or if one of the many non-Buddhist renunciants or brahmins, is not able to discuss with the$Tathāgata.$You know which food, if eaten, savored, and digested by the Tathā-$gata, will bring him peace and well-being; and you know which food,$if eaten,savored, and digested by the Tathāgata, will not bring him peace and well-being. 
You know which food, if eaten, savored, and digested by the Tathāgata, will cause him to teach the Dharma more eloquently;$and you know which food, if eaten, savored, and digested by the Tathā-$gata, will not cause him to teach the Dharma more eloquently.$Moreover, Ānanda, although you do not possess the knowledge of others’minds, you know well that the Buddha would rise from sitting in meditation in the late afternoon to teach people, that such is the$Tathāgata’s practice for today, or that such is the Tathāgata’s dwelling in happiness here and now. 
You speak carefully according to what was said, speaking the truth and not otherwise.$Then, intending to make the venerable Ānanda happy, the World-honored$One told the monks:$A wheel-turning monarch possesses four extraordinary qualities.$What are the four? When an assembly of khattiyas goes to visit the wheel-turning monarch, then if he is silent, they are delighted at the sight of him; and if he speaks, they are delighted to hear him. 
When an assembly of brahmins ...
of householders ...
of renunciants goes to visit the wheel-turning monarch, then if he is silent, they are delighted at the sight of him; and if he speaks, they are delighted to hear him.$The monk Ānanda likewise possesses four extraordinary qualities.$What are the four? When an assembly of monks goes to visit Ānanda,$then if he is silent, they are delighted at the mere sight of him; and if he speaks, they are delighted to hear [what he says]. 
When an assembly of nuns ...
of laymen ...
of laywomen goes to visit Ānanda, then if he is silent, they are delighted at the mere sight of him; and if he speaks,$they are delighted to hear [what he says].$269^taisho474c The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Moreover, when Ānanda teaches the Dharma to an assembly, there are four extraordinary qualities [in his teaching].$What are the four? The monk Ānanda teaches the Dharma to an assembly of monks wholeheartedly, not otherwise. 
And, the assembly of monks thinks, “May Venerable Ānanda continue to teach the Dharma.$May he not stop [teaching] midway.” The assembly of monks never grows tired of his teaching the Dharma until the monk Ānanda becomes silent of his own accord.$He teaches the Dharma to an assembly of nuns ...
of laymen ...$of laywomen wholeheartedly, not otherwise. 
And they think, “May$Venerable Ānanda continue to teach the Dharma. 
May he not stop$[teaching] midway.” The assembly of laywomen never grows tired of his teaching the Dharma until Venerable Ānanda becomes silent of his own accord.$Again, at one time, not long after the Buddha had attained final nirvana,$Venerable Ānanda was dwelling among the Vajjīs, in a village of the Vajjīs.$At that time, Venerable Ānanda was teaching the Dharma, surrounded by countless hundreds and thousands of people. 
Venerable Vajjiputta was also among the assembly. 
Venerable Vajjiputta thought to himself:$Is this venerable Ānanda a disciple in higher training and has not yet abandoned desire? Let me enter concentration such that I [can] examine the venerable Ānanda’s mind.$Then Venerable Vajjiputta entered concentration such that he [could]$examine the mind of Venerable Ānanda. 
By this means Venerable Vajjiputta knew that Venerable Ānanda was still a disciple in higher training and had not yet abandoned desire.$Venerable Vajjiputta then rose from concentration and uttered a verse to Venerable Ānanda:$Mountains and forest calm the thoughts$And make nirvana enter the mind.$[If you], [Ānanda] Gotama, meditate without distraction,$Soon [you] will realize the path of peace.$270$Division 4$Then Venerable Ānanda, having received the instruction given by Ven￾erable Vajjiputta, left the crowd to live in solitude and to practice diligently without being distracted.$Having left the crowd to live in solitude and to practice diligently without being distracted, he attained fully the summit of the holy life, for the sake of which a clansman shaves off his hair and beard, dons the yellow robe,$leaves home out of faith, and goes forth to practice the path. 
In this very life,$he personally attained understanding and awakening, and dwelled having personally realized. 
He knew as it really was: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. 
There will not be another existence.”$Venerable Ānanda had come to know the Dharma ...
(and so on up to) ...
attained arahantship. 
Venerable Ānanda said:$Venerable friends, when I was sitting on the bed and was about to lie down, just as my head was about to touch the pillow, all the taints were eradicated and I attained liberation of the mind.$That Venerable Ānanda [is able to] make such a declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Ānanda.$Venerable Ānanda also said, “Venerable friends, I shall attain final nirvana sitting cross-legged.” Then Venerable Ānanda sat cross-legged and attained final nirvana. 
That Venerable Ānanda sat cross-legged to attain final nirvana,$this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Ānanda.$This is what the Buddha said. 
Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.$34. 
^ck The Discourse by$Bakkula124$Thus have I heard: At one time, not long after the final nirvana of the Buddha,$Venerable Bakkula was staying at Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, at the$Squirrels’ Sanctuary.$At that time, one afternoon while wandering around, a non-Buddhist practitioner who had been a good friend of Venerable Bakkula from the time before he had gone forth, approached Venerable Bakkula, exchanged greetings,$and sat down to one side.$271^taisho475a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$The non-Buddhist practitioner said, “Friend Bakkula, I would like to ask you a question. 
Will you listen to it?”$Venerable Bakkula replied, “Practitioner of another school, ask what you wish. 
After hearing it, I will consider it.”$The non-Buddhist practitioner asked, “Friend Bakkula, how long have you been practicing the path in this true teaching and discipline?”$Venerable Bakkula answered, “Practitioner of another school, I have been practicing the path in this true teaching and discipline for eighty years already.”$The non-Buddhist practitioner asked further:$Friend Bakkula, during your eighty years of practicing the path in this true teaching and discipline, do you recall ever having had sexual inter￾course?$Venerable Bakkula answered the non-Buddhist practitioner:$You should not ask such a question. 
Instead [you should] ask a different question, “Friend Bakkula, during your eighty years of practicing the path in this true teaching and discipline, do you recall ever having given rise to any thought of sexual desire?” This, practitioner of another school, is the question you should ask.$Then the non-Buddhist practitioner said this:$I now ask a different question, friend Bakkula: During your eighty years of practicing the path in this true teaching and discipline, do you recall ever having given rise to any thought of sexual desire?$At this, [only] because the non-Buddhist practitioner asked the question,$Venerable Bakkula said to the monks:$Venerable friends, I have been practicing the path in this true teaching and discipline for eighty years, but that for this reason conceit should arise [in me], this is not the case.$That Venerable Bakkula [was able to] make this declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Bakkula.$Again, Venerable Bakkula declared:$272^taisho475b Division 4$Venerable friends, during my eighty years of practicing the path in this true teaching and discipline I have never had any thought of sexual desire.$That Venerable Bakkula [was able to] make this declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Bakkula.$Again, Venerable Bakkula declared, “Venerable friends, I have been wearing rag robes for eighty years, but that for this reason conceit should arise [in me], this is not the case.”$That Venerable Bakkula [was able to] make this declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Bakkula.$Again, Venerable Bakkula declared:$Venerable friends, I have been wearing rag robes for eighty years, I do not recall ever having accepted a robe from a lay follower, having cut up cloth to make a robe, having had other monks make a robe [for me],$or having sewn a robe or bag with a needle, not even a single thread.$That Venerable Bakkula [was able to] make this declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Bakkula.$Again, Venerable Bakkula declared, “Venerable friends, I have been begging food for eighty years, but that for this reason conceit should arise$[in me], this is not the case.”$That Venerable Bakkula [was able to] make this declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Bakkula.$Again, Venerable Bakkula declared:$Venerable friends, in my eighty years of begging food I do not recall ever having accepted an invitation from a lay follower, ever having gone beyond [the right time for] begging food, ever having begged food from a large household so as to get clean, good, very fine and luxurious food to eat, savor, and digest. 
I have never looked at a woman’s face. 
I do not recall ever having entered a nunnery. 
I do not recall ever having exchanged greetings with a nun, or even having spo￾ken [to a nun] on the road.$That Venerable Bakkula [was able to] make this declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Bakkula.$273$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Again, Venerable Bakkula declared:$Venerable friends, during my eighty years of practicing the path in this true teaching and discipline I do not recall ever having trained a novice,$nor do I recall ever having taught the Dharma to a lay follower, not even a verse of four lines.$That Venerable Bakkula [was able to] make this declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Bakkula.$Again, Venerable Bakkula declared:$Venerable friends, during my eighty years of practicing the path in this true teaching and discipline I have never been ill, not even having a headache for a moment. 
I do not recall ever having taken medicine,$not even a single piece of myrobalan.$That Venerable Bakkula [was able to] make this declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Bakkula.$Again, Venerable Bakkula declared:$Venerable friends, in my eighty years of practicing sitting meditation in the cross-legged posture, I have never leaned against a wall or a tree.$That Venerable Bakkula [was able to] make this declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Bakkula.$Again, Venerable Bakkula declared, “Venerable friends, within three days and nights, I attained the threefold realization.”$That Venerable Bakkula [was able to] make this declaration, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Bakkula.$Again, Venerable Bakkula declared, “Venerable friends, I will attain final Nirvana in the cross-legged sitting posture.” Then Venerable Bakkula attained final nirvana in the cross-legged sitting posture.$That Venerable Bakkula attained final nirvana in the cross-legged sitting posture, this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable Bakkula.$Such were the declarations made by Venerable Bakkula. 
At that time,$the non-Buddhist practitioner and the [Buddhist] monks, having heard these declarations, were delighted and remembered them well.$274^taisho475c Division 4$35. 
^ck The Discourse to the Asura125$Thus have I heard: At one time, the Buddha was staying at Verañjā, in the$Yellow Reed Grove.$At that time, when night was about to turn to dawn, Pahārāda, the asura king, son of the asura Malejā, of lofty appearance and radiant aura,$approached the Buddha, bowed down at the World-honored One’s feet, and stood to one side.$The World-honored One asked:$Pahārāda, for the asuras in the ocean, is there no decline in the life span of the asuras, or in the appearance of the asuras, the joy of the asuras,$or the strength of the asuras? Do the asuras delight in the ocean?$Pahārāda, the asura king, son of the asura Malejā, replied:$World-honored One, for us asuras in the ocean there is no decline in the life span of the asuras, or in the appearance of the asuras, the joy of the asuras, or the strength of the asuras. 
We asuras all delight in the ocean.$The World-honored One asked further, “Pahārāda, how many extraor￾dinary qualities does the ocean possess that the asuras delight in on seeing them?”$Pahārāda replied:$World-honored One, our ocean possesses eight extraordinary qualities that delight the asuras. 
What are these eight qualities? World-honored$One, from the bottom to the surface our ocean becomes gradually larger in circumference, evenly and uniformly increasing up to the shore; and its water is always full but never overflowing.

^ck The Discourse on$Earthquakes126$Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying in the Vajjian country in a town named Bhūmi. 
At that time, there was a violent earthquake. 
As the earth was quaking violently, a gale began blowing in all four directions, mete￾ors appeared in all four directions, and all the houses and walls collapsed and were destroyed utterly.$Then Venerable Ānanda saw that there was a violent earthquake, and that as the earth was quaking violently, a gale began blowing in all four direc￾tions, meteors appeared in all four directions, and all the houses and walls collapsed and were destroyed utterly. 
Seeing this, Venerable Ānanda was$281$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$terrified and his body hairs stood on end. 
He then approached the Buddha and, after paying respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet, stood to one side, and said:$World-honored One, just now the earth was quaking violently, and as the earth was quaking violently, a gale began blowing in all four direc￾tions, meteors appeared in all four directions, and all the houses and walls collapsed and were destroyed utterly.$Then the World-honored One spoke to Venerable Ānanda, saying:$Indeed, Ānanda. 
Just now the earth was quaking violently. 
Indeed,$Ānanda. 
As the earth was quaking violently, a gale began blowing in all four directions, meteors appeared in all four directions, and all the houses and walls collapsed and were destroyed utterly.$Then Venerable Ānanda asked:$World-honored One, how many causes are there due to which the earth quakes violently, and as the earth quakes violently a gale begins blowing in all four directions, meteors appear in all four directions, and all houses and walls collapse and are destroyed utterly?$The World-honored One replied:$Ānanda, there are three causes due to which the earth quakes violently,$and as the earth quakes violently a gale begins blowing in all four direc￾tions, meteors appear in all four directions, and all houses and walls collapse and are destroyed utterly.$What are the three? Ānanda, this earth rests upon water; the water rests upon wind; and the wind depends upon space. 
Ānanda, there comes a time when a great wind begins blowing in the sky. 
When the wind begins blowing, the water becomes disturbed; and when the water is disturbed, the earth quakes.$This is the first cause due to which the earth quakes violently, and as the earth quakes violently, a gale begins blowing in all four directions,$meteors appear in all four directions, and all houses and walls collapse and are destroyed utterly.$282^taisho477c Division 4$Again, Ānanda, a monk who possesses great supernormal power,$great and mighty virtue, great merit, great and mighty power, is able,$with the supernormal power of mastery over the mind, to develop per￾ception of earth as minute and perception of water as infinite.$On account of this, this earth behaves according to his wish, accord￾ing to his will, being disturbed again and again, quaking again and again.$Not only a monk, a god too, who has self-mastery, one who pos￾sesses great supernormal power, great and mighty virtue, great merit,$great and mighty power, is able to develop perception of earth as minute and perception of water as infinite with his supernormal power of mas￾tery over the mind.$On account of this, this earth behaves according to his wish, accord￾ing to his will, being disturbed again and again, quaking again and again.$This is the second cause due to which the earth quakes violently,$and as the earth quakes violently, a gale begins blowing in all four directions, meteors appear in all four directions, and all houses and walls collapse and are destroyed utterly.$Again, Ānanda, if a Tathāgata will be attaining final nirvana soon,$within three months, for this reason the earth quakes violently, and as the earth quakes violently, a gale begins blowing in all four directions,$meteors appear in all four directions, and all houses and walls collapse and are destroyed utterly.$This is the third cause due to which the earth quakes violently,$and as the earth quakes violently, a gale begins blowing in all four directions, meteors appear in all four directions, and all houses and walls collapse and are destroyed utterly.$Hearing this, Venerable Ānanda began to weep and shed tears. 
Placing his palms together [in respect] toward the Buddha, he said:$World-honored One, it is most wonderful, most remarkable that the$Tathāgata, who is free from attachment, fully awakened, has accom￾plished [all] meritorious deeds and acquired such extraordinary qualities.$Why is that? [Because] the Tathāgata will enter final nirvana soon,$within three months.

It is most wonderful, most remarkable that the Tathāgata, who is free from attachment, fully awakened, has accomplished [all] meritorious deeds and acquired such extraordinary qualities.$Why is that? [Because] the Tathāgata will enter final nirvana soon,$within three months.

^ck The Discourse at Campā127$Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was living at Campā near the$Gaggarā Lake. 
At that time, on the fifteenth day of the [half-]month, the day for reciting the code of rules, the World-honored One sat down on a seat prepared in front of the assembly of monks. 
After sitting down, the$World-honored One entered concentration and through the knowledge of others’ minds he surveyed the minds of [the monks in] the assembly. 
After surveying the minds of [the monks in] the assembly, he sat silently through the first watch of the night.$Then a certain monk got up from his seat, arranged his robe so as to bare one shoulder and, placing his palms together [in respect] toward the$Buddha, said:$World-honored One, the first watch of the night has ended. 
It has been a long time since the Buddha and the assembly of monks gathered and sat down here. 
May the World-honored One recite the code of rules!$At that time, the World-honored One remained silent and made no response.$Then the World-honored One continued to sit silently up to the middle watch of the night. 
That monk again got up from his seat, arranged his robe so as to bare one shoulder and, placing his palms together [in respect] toward the Buddha, said:$World-honored One, the first watch of the night is over, the middle watch of the night is coming to an end. 
It has been a long time since the Buddha and the assembly of monks gathered and sat down here.$May the World-honored One recite the code of rules!$At that time, the World-honored One again remained silent and made no response.$Then the World-honored One continued to sit silently up to the last watch of the night. 
A third time that monk got up from his seat, arranged his robe$286$Division 4$so as to bare one shoulder and, placing his palms together [in respect] toward the Buddha, said:$World-honored One, the first watch of the night has already ended, the middle watch of the night, too, has ended, and the last watch of the night is about to end. 
It is getting close to dawn; soon the dawn will come. 
It has been a very long time since the Buddha and the assembly of monks gathered and sat down here. 
May the World-honored One recite the code of rules!$Then the World-honored One said to that monk, “Among this assembly there is one monk who is impure.”$At that time Venerable Mahā Moggallāna was also among the assembly.$Then Venerable Mahā Moggallāna had this thought:$In regard to which monk did the World-honored One say that among this assembly there is one monk who is impure? Let me enter concen￾tration such that, through the knowledge of others’minds, I [can] survey the minds of the [monks in the] assembly.$Venerable Mahā Moggallāna then entered concentration such that, through the knowledge of others’ minds, he [could] survey the minds of the [monks in the] assembly. 
Then Venerable Mahā Moggallāna came to know the monk in regard to whom the World-honored One had said “Among this assembly there is one monk who is impure.”$Then Venerable Mahā Moggallāna emerged from concentration, went right in front of that monk, pulled him by the arm, opened the door, and thrust him outside, [saying]: “You fool, go far away, do not stay here. 
You are not allowed to gather again with the assembly of monks. 
Henceforth you are no longer a monk.”$Venerable Mahā Moggallāna then bolted the door and returned to where the Buddha was. 
Paying respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet, he stood to one side and said:$The monk in regard to whom the World-honored One had said$“Among this assembly there is one monk who is impure” has been expelled by me.$287^taisho478c The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$World-honored One, the first watch of the night has already ended,$the middle watch of the night, too, has ended, and the last watch of the night is about to end.

Having heard the Buddha’s words, Ven￾erable Mahā Moggallāna and the [other] monks were delighted and remem￾bered them well.$291^taisho479c The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$38. 
^ck The [First] Discourse to the$Householder Ugga129$Thus have I heard: At one time, the Buddha was at Vesālī, staying in the$Great Forest. 
At that time, the householder Ugga, who was waited on only by women, went out of Vesālī followed by all his women and, [part way]$between Vesālī and the Great Forest, enjoyed himself like a king with his concubines. 
Then the householder Ugga, having become very drunk on alco￾hol, left the women and went into the Great Forest.$The householder Ugga, very drunk on alcohol, saw from afar the World￾honored One, among the trees of the forest, dignified and beautiful, like the moon amidst the stars, with radiant aura, shining like a golden mountain,$endowed with majestic appearance and lofty dignity, with sense faculties calm, free of obstruction, accomplished and disciplined, with his mind calm and quiet. 
On seeing the Buddha, the householder Ugga sobered up instantly;$and, having sobered up, he approached the Buddha. 
Paying respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet, he sat down to one side. 
Then the World-honored$One taught him the Dharma, exhorted, encouraged, and delighted him.$Having with countless skillful means taught [Ugga] the Dharma, having exhorted, encouraged, and delighted him, [he did] as all buddhas do when first teaching the true Dharma to delight their hearers: he taught about gen￾erosity, virtue, rebirth in heaven, the disadvantages of sensual desire, and the defilement of [continued] birth and death, and he extolled the excellence of dispassion and the purity of the constituents of the path.$Having taught him the Dharma in this way, the Buddha knew that$[Ugga’s] mind was delighted, prepared, pliant, able to endure, uplifted, one￾pointed, free of doubt, free of hindrances, capable, and strong enough to receive the true teaching. 
Then the World-honored One taught him the essence of the true teaching taught by all buddhas: suffering, its arising, its cessation,$and the path [leading to its cessation].$Instantly, while seated [right there], the householder Ugga saw the four noble truths: suffering, its arising, its cessation, and the path [leading to its cessation]. 
Just as a piece of white cloth is easily dyed, so the householder$Ugga instantly, while seated [right there], saw the four noble truths: suffering,$its arising, its cessation, and the path [leading to its cessation].$292^taisho480a Division 4$Then the householder Ugga, having seen the Dharma, having attained the Dharma, awakened of his own accord to the pure Dharma, cut off doubt and overcame uncertainty. 
[For him] there was no other teacher; he would no longer follow others. 
Without hesitation, he abided in the realization of the fruit. 
In the teaching of the World-honored One he had attained fearlessness.$Then the householder Ugga rose from his seat, made obeisance to the$Buddha, and said:$World-honored One, I now take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma,$and the assembly of monks. 
May the World-honored One accept me as a lay follower. 
From this day forth I take refuge [in the Triple Gem]$until the end of my life. 
World-honored One, from this day forth, I$[vow to] follow the World-honored One, lead a life of celibacy, and keep the five precepts for the rest of my life.$Having [vowed to] follow the World-honored One, lead a life of celibacy,$and keep the five precepts for the rest of his life, the householder Ugga paid respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times,$and departed.$On returning home, he promptly assembled all the women [of the house].$Having assembled them, he said:$Know that I [have vowed to] follow the World-honored One, lead a life of celibacy, and keep the five precepts for the rest of my life. 
Who￾ever of you wishes to [continue to] live here may do so, practicing gen￾erosity and making merit; whoever does not wish to stay may return to her own home; and whoever wishes to be [re]married, I will have you [re]married.$Thereupon the first wife said to the householder Ugga:$Master, since you [have vowed] to follow the Buddha, lead a life of celibacy, and observe the five precepts for the rest of your life, you may marry me to such and such a man.$Then the householder Ugga had that man summoned. 
With his left hand holding his first wife’s arm and his right hand holding a golden pitcher [for the wedding ceremony], he told that man, “I now marry my first wife to you.”$293$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Hearing this, the man was terrified, and his bodily hair stood on end.$He said to the householder Ugga, “Master, do you want to kill me? Do you want to kill me?”$The householder replied:$I am not going to kill you. 
However, I [have vowed to] follow the$Buddha, lead a life of celibacy, and observe the five precepts for the rest of my life, and for that reason I am marrying my first wife to you.$After giving away his first wife, before giving her away, and at the time of giving her away, the householder Ugga had no thought of regret.$At that time the World-honored One was surrounded by countless hun￾dreds and thousands of people. 
In that great crowd he praised the householder$Ugga, [saying]: “The householder Ugga possesses eight extraordinary qual￾ities.”$Then after the night had passed, at dawn, a certain monk put on his robes,$took his almsbowl, and went to the house of the householder Ugga. 
Seeing from afar that a monk was coming, the householder Ugga promptly rose from his seat and arranged his clothes so as to bare one shoulder. 
Placing his palms together [in respect] toward the monk, he said “Welcome, venerable sir! The venerable one has not come here for a long time. 
Please take a seat on this bed.”$Then the monk took a seat on the bed. 
The householder Ugga paid respect with his head at the monk’s feet and sat to one side. 
The monk said:$Householder, you have had great gains and great merit. 
Why is that?$Because in an assembly of countless hundreds and thousands of people the World-honored One has praised you, [saying] “The householder$Ugga possesses eight extraordinary qualities.” Householder, what are those qualities that you possess?$The householder Ugga answered the monk, saying:$Venerable sir, [as] the World-honored One previously did not explain this further, I do not know in relation to what the World-honored One said this. 
In any case, venerable sir, please hear what qualities I possess.$At one time, venerable sir, the World-honored One was staying at$Vesālī, in the Great Forest. 
At that time, waited on only by women, I$294^taisho480b Division 4$went out of Vesālī followed by them and, [part way] between Vesālī$and the Great Forest, I enjoyed myself like a king with his concubines.$At that time, venerable sir, I was very drunk on alcohol. 
I left the women and went into the Great Forest.$At that time, venerable sir, very drunk on alcohol, I saw from afar the World-honored One, among the trees of the forest, dignified and beautiful, like the moon amid the stars, with radiant aura, shining like a golden mountain, endowed with handsome appearance and lofty dig￾nity, with sense faculties calm, free of obstruction, accomplished and disciplined, with his mind calm and quiet. 
On seeing the Buddha, I$sobered up instantly. 
Venerable sir, I possess this quality.$The monk spoke in praise, “Householder, it is most wonderful, most remarkable that you possess this quality.”$[The householder Ugga said:]$Venerable sir, I possess not only this quality. 
Moreover, venerable sir,$having sobered up, I approached the Buddha. 
Paying respect with my head at the Buddha’s feet, I sat to one side. 
Then the World-honored$One taught me the Dharma, exhorted, encouraged, and delighted me.$Having with countless skillful means taught me the Dharma, having exhorted, encouraged, and delighted me, [he did] as all buddhas do when first teaching the true Dharma to delight their hearers: he taught me about generosity, virtue, rebirth in heaven, the disadvantages of sensual desire, and the defilement of [continued] birth and death,$extolling the excellence of dispassion and the purity of the constituents of the path.

Instantly, while sitting [right there],$I saw the four noble truths, namely: suffering, its arising, its cessation,$and the path [leading to its cessation]. 
Just as a piece of white cloth is easily dyed, so, venerable sir, I instantly, while sitting [right there], saw$295^taisho480c The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$the four noble truths, namely: suffering, its arising, its cessation, and the path [leading to its cessation]. 
Venerable sir, I possess this quality.$The monk spoke in praise, “Householder, it is most wonderful, most remarkable that you possess this quality.”$[The householder Ugga continued:]$Venerable sir, I possess not only this quality. 
Moreover, venerable sir,$having seen the Dharma, having attained the Dharma, I awakened on my own to the pure Dharma, cut off doubt, and overcame uncertainty.$[For me] there was no other teacher; I would no longer follow others.$Without hesitation, I abided in the realization of the fruit.

From this day forth I take refuge [in the Triple$Gem] until the end of my life. 
World-honored One, from this day forth, I [vow to] follow the World-honored One, lead a life of celibacy, and observe the five precepts for the rest of my life.$Venerable sir, given that I [vowed to] follow the World-honored One,$lead a life of celibacy, and observe the five precepts for the rest of my life—and, to my knowledge, have never broken those precepts—I pos￾sess this quality, venerable sir.$The monk spoke in praise, “Householder, it is most wonderful, most remarkable that you possess this quality.”$[The householder Ugga continued:]$Venerable sir, I possess not only this quality. 
Moreover, having [vowed to] follow the World-honored One, lead a life of celibacy, and observe the five precepts for the rest of my life, I paid respect with my head at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and departed. 
On returning home, I assembled all the women [of the house]. 
Having assembled them, I said:$296$Division 4$Know that I [have vowed to] follow the World-honored One, lead a life of celibacy, and observe the five precepts for the rest of my life? Whoever of you wishes to [continue to] live here may do so,$practicing generosity and making merit; whoever does not wish to stay may return to her own home; and whoever wishes to be$[re]married, I will have her [re]married.$Thereupon my first wife said to me:$Master, since you [have vowed] to follow the Buddha, lead a life of celibacy, and observe the five precepts for the rest of your life,$you may marry me to such-and-such a man.$Then, venerable sir, I promptly had that man summoned. 
With my left hand holding my first wife’s arm and my right hand holding a golden pitcher, I told that man, “I now marry my first wife to you.”$Hearing this, the man was terrified, and his bodily hair stood on end. 
He said to me, “Master, do you want to kill me? Do you want to kill me?”$Venerable sir, I said to him:$I am not going to kill you. 
However, I [have vowed] to follow the$Buddha, lead a life of celibacy, and observe the five precepts for the rest of my life, and for that reason I marry my first wife to you.$Venerable sir, after giving away my first wife, before giving her away,$and at the time of giving her away, I had no thought of regret. 
Venerable sir, I possess this quality.$The monk spoke in praise, “Householder, it is most wonderful, most remarkable that you possess this quality.”$[The householder Ugga continued:]$Venerable sir, I possess not only this quality. 
Moreover, venerable sir,$when I visit a monastic dwelling, as soon as I see a monk I make obei￾sance to him. 
If he is practicing walking meditation, I follow him in practicing walking meditation. 
If he is seated, then I sit to one side and,$having sat down, I listen to the Dharma. 
That venerable one teaches the$Dharma to me and I also [in turn] teach the Dharma to that venerable$297^taisho481a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$one. 
That venerable one asks me questions and I also ask him questions.$That venerable one answers me and I also answer him. 
Venerable sir,$I do not recall ever having looked down on any monk, whether he is a junior [monk], one of middle rank, or an elder. 
Venerable sir, I possess this quality.$The monk spoke in praise, “Householder, it is most wonderful, most remarkable that you possess this quality.”$[The householder Ugga continued:]$Venerable sir, I possess not only this quality. 
Moreover, venerable sir,$when I make offerings to the assembly of monks, a deity in the sky informs me thus:$Householder, this one is an arahant, this one is on the path to ara￾hantship, this one is a non-returner, this one is on the path to non￾returning, this one is a once-returner, this one is on the path to once-returning, this one is a stream-enterer, this one is on the path to stream-entry, this one is diligent, this one is not diligent.$However, venerable sir, I do not recall that, when making offerings to the assembly of monks, I have ever discriminated among them. 
Ven￾erable sir, I possess this quality.$The monk spoke in praise, “Householder, it is most wonderful, most remarkable that you possess this quality.”$[The householder Ugga continued:]$Venerable sir, I possess not only this quality.$Moreover, venerable sir, when I make offerings to the assembly of monks, a deity in the sky informs me thus:$Householder, there is the Tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened; the teaching of the World-honored One is well taught;$the community of nobles of the Tathāgata is progressing well [in the practice].$Venerable sir, not out of faith in that deity’s words, nor out of delight in his words, nor because of having heard it from him, but instead by$298$Division 4$my own purified knowledge I know: the Tathāgata is one who is free from attachment, fully awakened; the teaching of the World-honored$One is well taught; the community of nobles of the Tathāgata is pro￾gressing well [in the practice]. 
Venerable sir, I possess this quality.$The monk spoke in praise, “Householder, it is most wonderful, most remarkable that you possess this quality.”$[The householder Ugga continued:]$Venerable sir, I possess not only this quality.$Moreover, venerable sir, those five lower fetters that the Buddha has declared, namely sensual desire, hatred, view of a self, clinging to precepts, and doubt, I have seen that of these five, which could bind me to returning to this world and entering a womb, not a single one has not been eradicated. 
Venerable sir, I possess this quality.$The monk spoke in praise, “Householder, it is most wonderful, most remarkable that you possess this quality.”$The householder Ugga said to the monk, “May the venerable one please take his meal here.”$For the householder Ugga’s sake, the monk accepted the invitation by remaining silent. 
Understanding that the monk had accepted the invitation by remaining silent, the householder Ugga rose from his seat, and personally prepared water for washing. 
With his own hands he prepared assorted pure and tasty dishes to eat, savor, and digest, making sure there was enough to eat. 
After [the monk] had finished eating, put aside his bowl, and washed his hands, [Ugga] took a low seat and sat to one side to listen to the Dharma.$The monk taught the householder the Dharma, exhorted, encouraged,$and delighted him. 
Having, with countless skillful means, taught him the$Dharma, having exhorted, encouraged, and delighted him, [the monk] rose from his seat and departed. 
He approached the Buddha. 
Paying respect with his head at [the Buddha’s] feet, he sat down to one side and reported in detail the conversation he had had with the householder Ugga.$Then the World-honored One told the monks, “It was for this reason that$I praised the householder Ugga, for possessing eight extraordinary qualities.”$This is what the Buddha said. 
Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.$299^taisho481b The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$39. 
^ck The [Second] Discourse to the$Householder Ugga$Thus have I heard: At one time, not long after the Buddha had attained final nirvana, many highly regarded senior monks were staying at Vesālī, in the$Gabled Hall near Monkey Lake. 
At that time, the householder Ugga was per￾forming a lavish almsgiving for those who had come from afar, for those on a journey, for the ill, and for those who were looking after the ill.$He was [also] regularly preparing porridge and meals for the monastery keepers, regularly inviting groups of twenty from the [monastic] community for food, and offering food to the assembly of monks every five days. 
Alms￾giving on such a lavish scale is like a ship, which, while returning with a full load of cargo worth hundreds and thousands, suddenly sinks and is lost.$An assembly of many highly regarded senior monks heard that the house￾holder Ugga was performing such a lavish almsgiving for those who had come from afar, for those on a journey, for the ill, and for those who were looking after the ill; [while also] regularly preparing porridge and meals for the monastery keepers, regularly inviting groups of twenty from the [monastic]$community for food, and offering food to the assembly of monks every five days. 
Hearing about this, they discussed it together thus:$Good friends, who could go and talk to the householder Ugga, [saying,]$“Householder, please stop! Do not perform such almsgiving again!$Later you yourself will understand [why]”?$They had this thought:$Venerable Ānanda was the Buddha’s attendant. 
He received the World￾honored One’s teachings and was praised by the Buddha and by his wise companions in the holy life. 
Venerable Ānanda should go and talk with the householder Ugga, [saying,] “Householder, please stop!$Do not perform such almsgiving again! Later you yourself will under￾stand [why].” Good friends, let us together go to Venerable Ānanda and tell him about this matter.$Then the assembly of many highly regarded senior monks went to Ven￾erable Ānanda.After exchanging greetings, they sat down to one side and said:$300^taisho481c Division 4$Venerable Ānanda, did you know that the householder Ugga is per￾forming a lavish almsgiving for those who have come from afar, for those on a journey, for the ill, and for those who are looking after the ill, [while also] regularly preparing porridge and meals for the monastery keepers, regularly inviting groups of twenty from the [monastic] com￾munity for food, and offering food to the assembly of monks every five days? Almsgiving on such lavish scale is like a ship, which, while returning with a full load of cargo worth hundreds and thousands, sud￾denly sinks and is lost. 
We have discussed this together thus:$Who could go and talk with the householder Ugga, [saying,]$“Householder, please stop! Do not perform such almsgiving again!$Later you yourself will understand [why]”?$Then we thought:$Venerable Ānanda was the Buddha’s attendant. 
He received the$World-honored One’s teachings and was praised by the Buddha and by his wise companions in the holy life. 
The venerable Ānanda should go and talk to the householder Ugga, [saying,] “House￾holder, stop! Do not perform such almsgiving! Later you yourself will understand [why].”$Venerable Ānanda, may you go and talk to the householder Ugga, [say￾ing,] “Householder, please stop! Do not perform such almsgiving again!$Later you yourself will understand [why].”$Then Venerable Ānanda said to those highly regarded senior monks:$Good friends, the householder Ugga has a stern personality. 
If I just speak for myself, I might make him very unhappy. 
Good friends, on whose behalf should I speak with him?$Those highly regarded senior monks replied, “Venerable friend, speak on behalf of the assembly of monks! Spoken to on behalf of the assembly of monks, he will have nothing to say.”$Then Venerable Ānanda silently accepted the assignment from those highly regarded senior monks. 
Understanding that Venerable Ānanda had$301$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$consented in silence, the highly regarded senior monks rose from their seats,$circumambulated Venerable Ānanda, and returned, each to his place.$Then at dawn, when the night was over, Venerable Ānanda put on his robes, took his almsbowl, and went to the house of the householder Ugga.$Seeing from afar that Venerable Ānanda was coming, the householder Ugga rose from his seat and arranged his robe so as to bare one shoulder.$Placing his palms together [in respect] toward Venerable Ānanda, he said “Welcome, Venerable Ānanda! Venerable Ānanda has not come here for a long time. 
Please take a seat on this bed.”$Then Venerable Ānanda took a seat on the bed. 
The householder Ugga paid respect with his head at Venerable Ānanda’s feet and sat down to one side. 
Venerable Ānanda said:$Householder, it is known that you are performing a lavish almsgiving for people who have come from afar, for those on a journey, for the ill, and for those who are looking after the ill, [while also] regularly preparing porridge and meals for the monastery keepers, regularly inviting groups of twenty from the [monastic] community for food,$and offering food to the assembly of monks every five days.$Almsgiving on such lavish scale is like a ship, which, while return￾ing with a full load of cargo worth hundreds and thousands, suddenly sinks and is lost. 
Householder, please stop! Do not perform such alms￾giving again! Later you yourself will understand [why].$The householder said, “Venerable Ānanda, on whose behalf do you speak thus?”$Venerable Ānanda replied, “Householder, I speak for the assembly of monks.”$The householder said:$If Venerable Ānanda speaks for the assembly of the monks, I have no objection. 
If he spoke for himself, that might make me very unhappy.$Venerable Ānanda, that I make offerings like this and perform generosity like this, even until I have given away all my wealth and property—$this is to fulfill my aspiration. 
It is like the aspiration of a wheel-turning monarch.$302^taisho482a Division 4$Venerable Ānanda asked, “Householder, what is the aspiration of a wheel￾turning monarch?”$The householder answered:$Venerable Ānanda, the poor from the villages think, “May I be the richest among the villagers.” This is their aspiration.$The rich from the villages think, “May I be the richest among the residents of the townships.” This is their aspiration.$The rich from the townships think, “May I be the richest among the residents of the town.” This is their aspiration.$The rich of the town think, “May I be the mayor of the town.”$This is their aspiration.$The mayors in the towns think, “May I be the prime minister of the state.” This is their aspiration.$The prime ministers of the states think, “May I be the local king.”$This is their aspiration.$The local kings think, “May I be a wheel-turning monarch.” This is their aspiration.$And the wheel-turning monarch thinks:$May I attain fully the summit of the holy life, for the sake of which a clansman shaves off his hair and beard, dons the yellow robe,$leaves home out of faith, and goes forth to practice the path. 
May$I in this very life, understand personally and dwell having realized personally. 
May I know as it really is: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done.$There will not be another existence.”$This is the aspiration [of a wheel-turning monarch].$Venerable Ānanda, that I make offerings like this and perform generosity like this, even until I have given away all my wealth and property—this is to fulfill my aspiration. 
It is like the aspiration of a wheel-turning monarch. 
Venerable Ānanda, I possess this quality.$Venerable Ānanda spoke in praise: “Householder, it is most wonderful,$most remarkable that you possess this quality.”$[The householder Ugga continued:]$303$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Moreover, Venerable Ānanda, I possess not only this quality.

If he is seated, then I sit to one side and, having sat down, I listen to the Dharma. 
That venerable one teaches the Dharma to me and I also teach the Dharma to that venerable one. 
That venerable one asks me questions and I also ask that venerable one questions. 
That venerable one answers me and I also answer that venerable one. 
Venerable Ānanda, I do not recall ever having looked down on any monk, whether he is a junior monk, one of middle rank,$or an elder. 
Venerable Ānanda, I possess this quality.$The venerable Ānanda spoke in praise: “Householder, it is most won￾derful, most remarkable that you possess this quality.”$[The householder Ugga continued:]$Moreover, Venerable Ānanda, I possess not only this quality. 
Venerable$Ānanda, when I offer alms to the assembly of monks, a deity in the sky informs me thus:$Householder, this one is an arahant, this one is on the path to ara￾hantship, this one is a non-returner, this one is on the path to non￾returning, this one is a once-returner, this one is on the path to once-returning, this one is a stream-enterer, this one is on the path to stream-entry, this one is diligent, this one is not diligent.$However, Venerable Ānanda, I do not recall that, when I make offerings to the assembly of monks, I have ever discriminated among them.

^ck The Discourse to the Householder$Hatthaka130$Thus have I heard: At one time, the Buddha was staying at Aggāḷava near$Āḷavī, in a rosewood grove.$At that time the householder Hatthaka, accompanied by five hundred eminent householders, went to the Buddha. 
He paid respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet and sat down to one side. 
The five hundred householders also paid respect with their heads at the Buddha’s feet and sat down to one side.$The World-honored One said, “Householder Hatthaka, now you are with such a great assembly. 
With what qualities are you [able to] gather such a great assembly?”$Then the householder Hatthaka replied:$World-honored One, there are four qualities for gathering people taught by the World-honored One. 
Charitable giving is the first, speaking friendly words is the second, providing helpful advice is the third, and being impartial is the fourth.$131 World-honored One, I [am able] to gather such a great assembly by charitable giving, or by speaking friendly words, or by providing helpful advice, or by being impartial.$The World-honored One spoke in praise:$Very good!

^ck The Discourse on “What is the Purpose?”134$Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s$Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.$At that time, in the late afternoon, Venerable Ānanda rose from sitting in meditation and went to the Buddha, paid homage at his feet, stood to one side,$and said: “World-honored One, what is the purpose of keeping the precepts?”$The World-honored One answered:$Ānanda, keeping the precepts has the purpose of [allowing one] to be without regret. 
Ānanda, if one keeps the precepts, one attains [the state of] being without regret.$Again Ānanda asked: “World-honored One, what is the purpose of being without regret?”$The World-honored One answered: “Ānanda, being without regret has the purpose of joy. 
Ānanda, if one is without regret, one attains joy.”$Again Ānanda asked: “World-honored One, what is the purpose of joy?”$The World-honored One answered: “Ānanda, joy has the purpose of rap￾ture.

Ānanda, if one has rapture, one attains tranquility of the body.”$Again Ānanda asked: “World-honored One, what is the purpose of tran￾quility?”$The World-honored One answered: “Ānanda, tranquility has the purpose of happiness. 
Ānanda, if one has tranquility, one attains the experience of happiness.”$319$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Again Ānanda asked: “World-honored One, what is the purpose of hap￾piness?”$The World-honored One answered: “Ānanda, happiness has the purpose of concentration. 
Ānanda, if one has happiness one attains concentration of the mind.”$Again Ānanda asked: “World-honored One, what is the purpose of con￾centration?”$The World-honored One answered:$Ānanda, concentration has the purpose of seeing things as they really are, knowing things as they really are. 
Ānanda, if one has concentration,$one attains [the ability] to see and know things as they really are.$Again Ānanda asked: “World-honored One, what is the purpose of seeing and knowing things as they really are?”$The World-honored One answered:$Ānanda, seeing and knowing things as they really are has the purpose of disenchantment.

Ānanda, if one is disenchanted, one attains dispassion.”$Again Ānanda asked: “World-honored One, what is the purpose of dis￾passion?”$The World-honored One answered:$Ānanda, dispassion has the purpose of liberation. 
Ānanda, if one is dispassionate, one attains liberation from all lust, anger, and ignorance.$Ānanda, through keeping the precepts one has no regrets; through having no regrets one attains joy; through joy one attains rapture;$through rapture one attains tranquility; through tranquility one attains happiness; through happiness one attains concentration.

^ck The Discourse to Meghiya149$Thus have I heard: Once the Buddha was staying in Magadha, near the village of Jatu,$150 in a cave in a lonely wild mango grove.$349^taisho491a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$At that time Venerable Meghiya was his attendant. 
Early one morning$Venerable Meghiya put on his robe, took his bowl, and entered the village of$Jatu to beg for food. 
Having finished begging for food, he went to the bank of the river Kimikāḷā, where he saw a level spot called the Good Mango Grove.$The water of the Kimikāḷā was pleasant and agreeable, [coming] from a clear spring and being of gentle flow, not too cold and not too warm. 
Seeing this, Venerable Meghiya felt joy and thought:$This is a level spot called the Good Mango Grove. 
Here the water of the Kimikāḷā is pleasant and agreeable, [coming] from a clear spring and being of gentle flow, not too cold and not too warm. 
If a clansman wished to practice striving,$151 he should do it in such a place.

Wait a little, until some other monk comes along to serve as my attendant, then you can go to that secluded mango grove to practice.$Then Meghiya said:$For the World-honored One there is nothing more to do, nothing that has to be done, nothing that has to be contemplated. 
For me, however,$there is still more to do, there is more that has to be done, there is more to contemplate.

He paid homage at the$Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and left. 
He went to the mango grove and having entered it, spread out his sitting mat under a tree and sat cross-legged.$While Venerable Meghiya was sitting in the mango grove three kinds of bad, unwholesome thoughts arose in him: thoughts of desire, thoughts of hatred, and thoughts of harming.

Having arrived there, he made obeisance, sat down to one side, and said:$World-honored One.

It is very rare that people in the world are able to fulfill their intentions in regard to sensual pleasures or become disenchanted with sensual pleasures by the time they die.$The Buddha told Ānanda:$That is so. 
That is so. 
Very few people in the world are able to fulfill their intentions in regard to sensual pleasures, and only few become disenchanted with sensual pleasures by the time they die.

On the contrary, Ānanda, many people in the world, a great many,$are not able to fulfill their intentions in regard to sensual pleasures and do not become disenchanted with sensual pleasures by the time they die. 
Why is that?$In the past, Ānanda, there was a king called Mandhātu, a wheel￾turning monarch, intelligent and wise, equipped with a fourfold army to reign over the entire world, freely, as he liked.

There is no feeling, no perception, no voli￾tional formation, no consciousness that is eternal and unchanging, is entirely pleasant, and exists forever.$Then the World-honored One took up a little bit of cow dung with his fingernail, and said, “Monk, do you see the little bit of cow dung that I have taken up with my fingernail?”$The monk said, “Yes, World-honored One. 
I see it.”$The Buddha further told the monk:$[Small as this is], there is not even such a small amount of material form that is eternal and unchanging, is entirely pleasant, and exists forever. 
[Small as this is], there is not even such a small amount of feeling, of perception, of volitional formations, of consciousness that is eternal and unchanging, is entirely pleasant, and exists forever.$Why is that? Monk, I recall how, in the distant past, I practiced meritorious deeds for a long time. 
Having practiced meritorious deeds for a long time, I experienced pleasant results for a long time. 
Monk,$374^taisho496b Division 6$[because] in the distant past I had practiced loving-kindness for seven years, I did not come to [be born in] this world for seven cosmic periods of emergence and destruction.$When the world went to destruction, I was born into the heaven of radiance. 
When the world emerged [again], I descended to take birth in a vacant Brahmā palace. 
Among the Brahmās [there] I was the Great$Brahmā, being the self-created heavenly king over other places for a thousand cosmic periods. 
[Again,] I was Sakka, king of the gods, for thirty-six cosmic periods, and I was the khattiya king Mandhātu for countless cosmic periods.$Monk, when I was the khattiya king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thousand great elephants, equipped with fine chariot equipment, dec￾orated with various treasures, with white pearls and jade, the chief of which was the royal elephant, Uposatha.$Monk, when I was the khattiya king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thousand horses equipped with fine chariot equipment, decorated with various treasures, gold and silver entwined with jade, the chief of which was the royal horse Valāhaka.$Monk, when I was the khattiya king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thousand chariots, decorated with four kinds of ornaments and various beautiful things, such as the hides of lions, tigers, and leopards, woven with decorations of varied colors and various decorations, very fast chariots, the chief of which was the chariot Vejayanta.$Monk, when I was the khattiya king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thousand cities, very large and pleasant, with many inhabitants, the chief of which was Kusāvatī.$Monk, when I was the khattiya king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thousand multistoried buildings, made of four kinds of precious mate￾rial, gold, silver, beryl, and crystal, the chief of which was the Su￾dhamma Hall.$Monk, when I was the khattiya king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thousand thrones, made of four kinds of precious materials, gold, silver,$beryl, and crystal, and upholstered with woolen textiles, draped with brocades and fine silk fabric, with lined and quilted coverlets, and with cushions [made of] antelope hide at both ends.$375$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Monk, when I was the khattiya king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thousand suits of clothing: clothing of flax, clothing of brocade, clothing of silk, clothing of cotton, and clothing of antelope hide.$Monk, when I was the khattiya king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thousand women, each with a splendid, clear, bright, fresh body, of extraordinary beauty, exceeding human [beauty], almost divine [beauty],$dignified beauty that delighted those who saw it, adorned with various treasures and necklaces of jade and pearl for dignified decoration, pure khattiya women, as well as countless women from other castes.$Monk, when I was the khattiya king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thousand kinds of food, served day and night constantly for me to eat when I wished.$Monk, of those eighty-four thousand kinds of food there was one that was particularly delicious and fresh, with numerous flavors, which$I often ate.$Monk, of those eighty-four thousand women there was one khattiya woman, the most dignified and beautiful, who often waited on me.$Monk, of those eighty-four thousand suits of clothes there was one suit, of flax or brocade or silk or cotton or antelope hide, that I$often wore.$Monk, of those eighty-four thousand thrones there was one throne,$of gold or silver or beryl or crystal, upholstered with woolen textiles,$draped with brocade or fine silk fabric, with lined and quilted coverlets,$and with cushions [made of] antelope hide at both ends, on which I$often sat.$Monk, of those eighty-four thousand multistoried buildings, there was one [made of] gold or of silver or of beryl or of crystal, called the$Sudhamma Hall, in which I often stayed.$Monk, of those eighty-four thousand cities there was one, very wealthy and pleasant, with many inhabitants, named Kusāvatī, in which$I often resided.$Monk, of those eighty-four thousand chariots there was one, dec￾orated with various beautiful things such as the hide of lions, tigers, and leopards, woven with designs of varied colors, a chariot that was very fast, named Vejayanta, that I often rode in when visiting pleasure parks.$376^taisho496c Division 6$Monk, of those eighty-four thousand horses there was one, with bluish body and crow-like head, the royal horse named Valāhaka that$I often rode when visiting pleasure parks.$Monk, of those eighty-four thousand elephants there was one whose entire body was very white and whose seven parts were perfect,$the royal elephant named Uposatha that I often rode when visiting pleasure parks.$Monk, I thought:$The fruit and result of what kinds of action have caused me to be endowed today with [such] great supernormal power, great and mighty virtue, great merit, great and mighty power?$Monk, again I thought:$The fruits and results of three kinds of action cause me to be endowed today with [such] great supernormal power, great and mighty virtue, great merit, great and mighty power. 
The first is charitable giving, the second self-discipline, and the third restraint.$Contemplate on it, monk: All of that, the whole of it, ceased to be. 
The supernormal power too was lost. 
What do you think, monk? Is material form permanent or impermanent?$[The monk] answered, “It is impermanent, World-honored One.”$[The Buddha] asked further, “If it is impermanent, is it suffering or not suffering?”$[The monk] answered, “It is suffering, [since] it changes, World-honored$One.$[$”$The Buddha] asked further: “If it is impermanent, suffering and subject to change, would a learned noble disciple take it as: ‘This I am, this is mine,$or I belong to that’?”$[The monk] answered, “No, World-honored One.”$[The Buddha] asked further, “What do you think, monk? Are feeling,$perception, volitional formations, and consciousness permanent or imper￾manent?”$[The monk] answered, “They are impermanent, World-honored One.”$377^taisho497a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$[The Buddha] asked further, “If they are impermanent, are they suffering or not suffering?”$[The monk] answered, “They are suffering since they change, World￾honored One.”$[The Buddha] asked further:$If they are impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, would a learned noble disciple take them as: “This I am, this is mine, or I belong to that”?$[The monk] answered, “No, World-honored One.”$[The Buddha said:]$Therefore, monk, you should train like this:$Whatever there is of material form, whether past, future, or present,$internal or external, gross or subtle, good or bad, near or far—all that should be seen as it really is with wisdom thus: all that I am not, that is not mine, I do not belong to that.$Whatever there is of feeling ...

of consciousness, whether past, future, or present,$internal or external, gross or subtle, good or bad, near or far—all that should be seen as it really is with wisdom thus: all that I am not, that is not mine, I do not belong to that.$If, monk, a learned noble disciple contemplates in this way, he becomes disenchanted with material form, he becomes disenchanted with feeling,$perception, volitional formations, and consciousness. 
Being disenchanted,$he becomes dispassionate. 
Having become dispassionate, he is liberated.$Having been liberated, he knows that he is liberated. 
He knows as it really is: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. 
There will not be another existence.”$Then that monk, having heard what the Buddha said, received it well and kept it [in mind]. 
He rose from his seat, paid respect with his head at the$Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times and departed.$Having received the Buddha’s instruction, that monk lived alone in a secluded place and practiced diligently, without negligence. 
Having lived$378$Division 6$alone in a secluded place and practiced diligently, without negligence—he attained fully the summit of the holy life, for the sake of which a clansman shaves off his hair and beard, dons the yellow robe, leaves home out of faith,$and goes forth to practice the path.$In that very life, he personally attained understanding and awakening,$and dwelled having personally realized. 
He knew as it really was: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done.$There will not be another existence.”$Thus that monk, having understood the Dharma (and so on up to), became an arahant.$This is what the Buddha said. 
Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.$62. 
^ck The Discourse on King Bimbisāra$Meeting the Buddha159$Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha, who was staying in the country of Magadha with a large company of monks—a thousand monks, all free of attachment, having attained the truth, former matted-hair ascetics—was approaching Rājagaha, a city of Magadha.$Then, the king of Magadha, Bimbisāra, heard that the World-honored$One, who was dwelling in the country of Magadha with a large company of monks—a thousand monks, all free of attachment, having attained the truth,$former matted-hair ascetics—had come to Rājagaha, a city of Magadha.$Having heard that, Bimbisāra, king of Magadha, assembled his fourfold army, that is, elephant troops, cavalry, chariot troops, and infantry. 
Having assembled his fourfold army, he went to visit the Buddha accompanied by countless people, [a company that was] one league in length.$Then the World-honored One, seeing from afar that Bimbisāra, king of$Magadha, was coming, left the road and went to a well-established royal banyan tree, placed his sitting mat beneath it, and sat down cross-legged,$together with the company of monks.$Bimbisāra, king of Magadha, saw from afar the World-honored One among the trees of the forest, dignified and beautiful, like the moon amidst the stars, with radiant aura, shining like a golden mountain, endowed with handsome appearance and lofty dignity, with sense faculties calm, free of$379^taisho497b The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$obstruction, accomplished and disciplined, with his mind calm and quiet.$Seeing this, [the king] descended from his chariot.$Like any khattiya king who has been [consecrated by] the sprinkling of water on his head, who is the lord of his people and reigns over the entire land, he was equipped with the five royal insignia: first, a sword; second, a parasol; third, a royal headdress; fourth, a fly whisk with bejeweled handle;$and fifth, ornate sandals. 
Having put aside all of these and left the fourfold army behind, he approached the Buddha on foot.$Arriving there, he made obeisance and three times announced his name,$“World-honored One, I am the king of Magadha, Seniya Bimbisāra.” [He said] this three times.$Then, the World-honored One said, “Great king, indeed, indeed, you are Seniya Bimbisāra, king of Magadha.”$Then Seniya Bimbisāra, king of Magadha, having announced his name three times, made obeisance to the Buddha and sat down to one side. 
Some among the citizens of Magadha made obeisance [with their heads] at the$Buddha’s feet and then sat down to one side; some exchanged greetings with the Buddha and then sat down to one side; some saluted the Buddha with palms placed together [in respect] and then sat down to one side; and some,$having seen the Buddha from afar, sat down silently.$At that time, Venerable Uruvela Kassapa was sitting among the company$[of monks]. 
Venerable Uruvela Kassapa was well remembered by the citizens of Magadha, being reckoned by them as a great and venerable teacher and a True Person, free of attachment.$Then the citizens of Magadha thought:$Does the renunciant Gotama train in the holy life under Uruvela Kassapa or does Uruvela Kassapa train in the holy life under the renunciant$Gotama?$At that time the World-honored One, knowing what the citizens of Maga￾dha were thinking, recited a verse to Venerable Uruvela Kassapa:$Uruvela [Kassapa], what did you see$That you stopped [worshiping] fire and came here?$Tell me, Kassapa,$Why do you no longer [perform] the fire sacrifice?$380^taisho497c Division 6$[Uruvela Kassapa replied:]$I worshiped fire out of desire$For food and drink of various flavors.$[But] the vision of the middle [path] arose, like this,$Therefore, I no longer delighted in [such] sacrifices.$[The Buddha asked further:]$Kassapa, [though] your mind did not delight$In food and drink of various flavors,$Tell me, Kassapa,$Why did you not delight in [becoming] a dweller in the heavens?$[Uruvela Kassapa replied:]$[Since] seeing quiescence, cessation,$And the unconditioned, I do not desire [any] existence,$Least of all [that of] the revered heavens.$Therefore, I no longer perform the fire sacrifice.$The World-honored One is supreme,$The World-honored One has no wrong thought,$He has realized and awakened to all things.$I have accepted [his] supreme Dharma.$Then the World-honored One said, “Kassapa, you should now display$[your] supernormal powers, in order to arouse faith and delight in the assembly.”$Then Venerable Uruvela Kassapa performed a supernatural feat such that he disappeared from his seat and appeared in the east, soaring through the air while displaying the four postures, of which the first is walking, the second standing, the third sitting, and the fourth is reclining.$Again, he entered concentration on the fire [element]. 
Once Venerable$Uruvela Kassapa had entered concentration on the fire [element], there emerged from his body flames of various colors: blue, yellow, red, and white, and amid them clear water. 
When fire emerged from the lower part of his body, water emerged from the upper part of his body; when fire emerged from the upper part of his body, water emerged from the lower part of his body.$381$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$In the same way [he appeared] in the south, ...

When fire emerged from the lower part of his body, water emerged from the upper part of his body; when fire emerged from the upper part of his body, water emerged from the lower part of his body.$Then Venerable Uruvela Kassapa, having completed his supernatural feat, made obeisance to the Buddha and said:$World-honored One, the Buddha is my master; I am the disciple of the$Buddha. 
The Buddha has all-encompassing knowledge; I do not have all-encompassing knowledge.$Then the World-honored One said, “So it is, Kassapa; so it is, Kassapa.$I have all-encompassing knowledge; you do not have all-encompassing knowledge.”$At that time, Venerable Uruvela Kassapa recited a verse about himself:$In the past when I was ignorant,$I sacrificed to fire in order to be liberated.$Though old, I was like one born blind.$I had wrong [view] and did not see the ultimate truth.$Now I see the superior path$Taught by the supreme nāga:$The unconditioned, final liberation from suffering.$When that is seen, birth and death are ended.$Having witnessed this, the citizens of Magadha thought:$The renunciant Gotama does not train in the holy life under Uruvela$Kassapa; Uruvela Kassapa trains in the holy life under the renunciant$Gotama.$382^taisho498a Division 6$The World-honored One, knowing the thoughts of the citizens of Maga￾dha, then taught the Dharma to Seniya Bimbisāra, king of Magadha, exhorting,$encouraging, and delighting him.$Having with countless skillful means taught him the Dharma, having exhorted, encouraged, and delighted him, [he did] as all buddhas do when first teaching the true Dharma to delight their hearers: he taught him about generosity, virtue, rebirth in heaven, the disadvantages of sensual desire, and the defilement of [continued] birth and death, extolling the excellence of dis￾passion and the purity of the constituents of the path. 
The World-honored$One gave the great king [such] teachings.$The Buddha knew that [the king’s] mind was delighted, prepared, mal￾leable, able to endure, uplifted, one-pointed, free of doubt, free of the hin￾drances, [possessing] the ability and power to receive the true Dharma, in accordance with the essential teaching of all buddhas. 
The World-honored$One then taught him about suffering, its arising, its cessation and the path$[leading to its cessation]:$Great king, material form arises and ceases.

He has attained stillness. 
If he has become detached from these five aggregates, he will not again cling to any aggregate.$Then the citizens of Magadha thought:$If material form is impermanent, if feeling ...
perception ...
volitional formations ...
consciousness is impermanent, then who lives and who experiences suffering and happiness?$The World-honored One, knowing the thoughts of the citizens of Maga￾dha, told the monks:$An ignorant worldling, one who is not learned, regards himself as “I$am a self” and is attached to that self. 
However, there is no self; there is nothing that belongs to a self; [all this] is empty of a self and empty of anything that belongs to a self. 
When phenomena arise, they arise;$384^taisho498b Division 6$when phenomena cease, they cease. 
All this is [just] a combination of causes and conditions, giving rise to suffering. 
If the causes and con￾ditions were not present, then all suffering would cease. 
It is because of the combination of causes and conditions that living beings continue and all phenomena arise. 
The Tathāgata, having seen all living beings continuously arising, declares: There is birth and there is death. 
With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses human [vision], I see beings as they die and are reborn handsome or ugly, excellent or not excellent, as they come and go between good or bad realms of existence,$in accordance with their [previous] deeds. 
I see this as it really is. 
If these living beings were ill behaved in body, speech, and mind, if they reviled noble ones, held wrong views, and undertook actions [based on] wrong views, then because of these causes and conditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they will certainly go to a bad realm of existence, [even] being born in hell. 
If [however] these living beings were well behaved in body, speech, and mind, if they did not revile noble ones, held right views, and undertook actions [based on]$right views, then because of these causes and conditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they will certainly go to a good realm of existence, [even] to a heavenly realm.$Knowing that it is thus for them, I do not say to them, “It is the self that can feel, can talk, that gives teachings, that undertakes devel￾opment, that teaches development, that experiences the fruits of good or evil actions here and there.” Herein, some may think, “This does not match; this cannot stand.”$[But despite their objections] these processes take place in accor￾dance with Dharma: Because of this, that arises; if this cause is not present, that does not arise. 
Because this exists, that exists; if this ceases,$that ceases. 
That is to say: with ignorance as condition there are voli￾tional formations; (and so on up to) with birth as condition there are old age and death. 
If ignorance ceases, volitional formations cease;$(and so on up to) if birth ceases, old age and death cease.$[The Buddha said] “Great king, what do you think? Is material form permanent or impermanent?”$385^taisho498c The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$[The king] answered, “It is impermanent, World-honored One.”$[The Buddha] asked again, “If it is impermanent, is it suffering or not suffering?”$[The king] answered, “It is suffering [since] it changes, World-honored$One.”$[The Buddha] asked again, “If it is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, does a learned noble disciple take it as: ‘This I am, this is mine,$I belong to that’?”$[The king] answered, “No, World-honored One.”$[The Buddha asked again]: “Great king, what do you think?

Having attained liberation, he knows that he is liberated. 
He knows as it really is: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. 
There will not be another existence.”$As the Buddha delivered this teaching, [the mind of] Seniya Bimbisāra,$king of Magadha, became free of defilements, and [in regard] to all phenomena the Dharma eye arose [in him]; and [the minds of] eighty thousand gods and twelve thousand citizens of Magadha became free of defilements, and [in regard] to all phenomena the Dharma eye arose [in them].$Then Seniya Bimbisāra, king of Magadha, saw the Dharma, attained the$Dharma, realized the perfectly pure Dharma; he discarded doubt, overcame perplexity; he would take no other teacher, would never again follow another;$he was without uncertainty.$Having attained the fruit of realization and attained unshakeability in the Dharma of the World-honored One, [the king] rose from his seat, made obeisance [with his head] at the Buddha’s feet, and said:$World-honored One, I now take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma,$and the community of monks. 
May the World-honored One please receive me as a lay follower; from this day on until life ends, I take refuge [in the Triple Gem] for my whole life.$This is what the Buddha said. 
Having heard the Buddha’s words, Seniya$Bimbisāra, king of Magadha, eighty thousand gods, twelve thousand citizens of Magadha, and a thousand monks were delighted and remembered them well.$63. 
^ck The Discourse at$Vebhaḷiṅga160$Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying in the country of$Kosala. 
At that time the World-honored One was walking on a road together with a large company of monks.

Buddhas and$Tathāgatas, free from attachment and fully awakened, do not smile randomly, for no reason. 
May I hear the meaning [of this smile]?$Then the World-honored One said: “Ānanda, in this place the Tathāgata$Kassapa, free from attachment and fully awakened, sat and taught [his] dis￾ciples the Dharma.”$Then Venerable Ānanda prepared a seat in that place and, with palms placed together [in respect] toward the Buddha, said:$World-honored One, may the World-honored One also sit in this place and teach his disciples the Dharma! In this way, this place will have been made use of by two Tathāgatas, free from attachment and fully awakened.$Then the World-honored One sat on the seat prepared in that place by$Venerable Ānanda. 
Having sat down, he said:$Ānanda, in this place there was an assembly hall of the Tathāgata Kas￾sapa, free from attachment and fully awakened.

He was born to parents of pure descent.$For seven generations on both his father’s and mother’s sides there was uninterrupted continuity of births without blemish.

You should know that he was me.$At that time, Ānanda, I wanted to benefit myself, to benefit others,$to benefit many people; I had compassion for the whole world, and I$sought prosperity, benefit, peace, and happiness for gods and human beings.$In the teaching taught at that time I did not reach the ultimate, the ultimate purity, the ultimate holy life, the ultimate completion of the holy life. 
At that time I was not able to abandon birth, old age, disease,$death, sorrow, and distress, and I was not able to attain liberation from all suffering.$Ānanda, I have now appeared in this world as a Tathāgata, free of attachment, fully awakened, perfect in knowledge and conduct, a Well￾gone One, a knower of the world, unsurpassable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and human beings, a Buddha, a Fortunate$One.$I now benefit myself, benefit others, benefit many people; I have compassion for the whole world, and I seek prosperity, benefit, peace,$and happiness for gods and human beings.$The teaching I now give leads to the ultimate, is the ultimate purity,$the ultimate completion of the holy life. 
I have now abandoned birth,$406^taisho503a Division 6$old age, sickness, death, sorrow, and distress.

After [having been] in the great hell With four gates, they appear in the [great] hell with a high peak, which is burning with fire within [yet] not [manifesting] smoke or flames. 
They are forced to walk on it, to walk to and fro and round and round. 
The skin, flesh, and blood of their two feet disappears [through being burnt]$when they put their feet down, but it reappears and becomes as before once they lift their feet up. 
They are punished in this way for countless hundreds and thousands of years, enduring extreme pain; yet they are unable to die until [the results of] their evil and unwholesome actions have been completely exhausted.$Again, after a very long period, those beings emerge from the great hell with a high peak. 
After [having been] in the great hell with a high peak, they appear in the great hell of excrement, which is filled with excrement, countless thousands of feet deep. 
Those beings all fall into it. 
Inside the great hell of excrement there appear numerous worms called lingqu-lai, with white body, black head, and a needle-like mouth.$These worms gnaw into the feet of those beings and devour them.$Having devoured the feet, they gnaw into and devour the calf bones.$Having devoured the calf bones, they gnaw into and devour the thigh bones.

After [having been] in the great hell of excre￾ment, they appear in the great hell of the iron-leaved forest. 
Having seen it, those beings have an impression of coolness and they think:$“Let us go there quickly to cool down!” Those beings go toward [this forest], seeking a safe place, a refuge.$Then the countless hundreds and thousands of beings that have gathered enter the great hell of the iron-leaved forest. 
In the great hell of the iron-leaved Forest, a great hot wind blows from the four direc￾tions. 
After the blowing of the hot wind, the iron leaves fall. 
When the iron leaves fall, they cut the hands, the feet, or the hands and feet; they cut the ears, the nose, or the ears and nose, as well as other limbs.$[Those beings] have their bodies cut and smeared with blood for count￾less hundreds and thousands of years, enduring extreme pain; yet they are unable to die until [the results of] their evil and unwholesome actions have been completely exhausted.$Again, in the great hell of the iron-leaved forest there appear giant dogs with very long fangs.

After [having been] in the great hell of the iron-leaved forest, they appear in the great hell of the iron sword￾tree forest.$Those great iron sword-trees are one league high and have thorns some six feet long. 
Those beings are made to climb up and down them.$When they climb up the trees, the thorns turn downward. 
When they climb down the trees, the thorns turn upward. 
The thorns of the sword￾trees pierce those beings, piercing their hands, their feet, or their hands and feet; piercing their ears, their nose, or their ears and nose, as well as the other limbs. 
[Those beings] have their bodies pierced and smeared with blood for countless hundreds and thousands of years, enduring extreme pain; yet they are unable to die until [the results of] their evil and unwholesome actions have been completely exhausted.$Again, after a very long period, those beings emerge from the great hell of the iron sword-tree forest. 
After [having been] in the great hell of the iron sword-tree forest they appear by [the side of] the caustic river, which has very high banks surrounded everywhere by thorns.$The caustic water is boiling and very dark.$Seeing this, those beings have the impression that this is cool water$[thinking]: “There will be cool water.” Having thisimpression, they think,$“Let us go there, bathe in it, and drink as we please, to quickly cool down and be at ease.” Those beings, competing with one another, run toward$[the caustic river] and enter it, seeking a pleasant place, a refuge.$Then the countless hundreds and thousands of beings that have gathered there fall into the caustic river. 
Having fallen into the caustic river, they are swept downstream, or swept upstream, or swept down￾stream and upstream. 
As those beings are swept downstream, swept upstream, or swept downstream and upstream, their skin is cooked and peels off, their flesh is cooked and peels off, their skin and flesh are cooked and peel off, [until] only the skeleton remains. 
On both banks of the caustic river there are wardens of hell holding swords, big clubs,$418$Division 6$and iron hooks in their hands. 
When those beings want to climb up on to the bank, the wardens of hell push them back again.$Again, on both banks of the caustic river there are wardens of hell,$holding hooks and nets in their hands. 
With the hooks they pull those beings out of the caustic river and put them on the ground of red-hot iron, burning, glowing, and all ablaze. 
They lift those beings up and then throw them on the ground [again], roll them [all over] the ground,$and ask them, “Where do you come from?” Those beings answer, “We do not know where we come from, but we are now suffering from great hunger.”$Those wardens of hell then put those beings on a bed of red-hot iron, which is burning, glowing, and all ablaze, forcing them to sit on it. 
They open their mouths with red-hot iron pincers, and put red-hot iron balls, burning brightly and all ablaze, into their mouths. 
Those red-hot iron balls burn the lips. 
Having burned the lips, they burn the tongue. 
Having burned the tongue, they burn the palate. 
Having burned the palate, they burn the throat. 
Having burned the throat, they burn the heart. 
Having burned the heart, they burn the large intestine. 
Having burned the large intestine, they burn the small intestine. 
Having burned the small intestine, they burn the stomach. 
Having burned the stomach,$they come out from the lower part of the body. 
Those [beings] are tor￾mented in this way for countless hundreds and thousands of years,$enduring extreme pain; yet they are unable to die until [the results of]$their evil and unwholesome actions have been completely exhausted.$Again, the wardens of hell ask those beings, “Where do you want to go?” Those beings answer, “We do not know where we want to go,$but we are suffering from great thirst.” The wardens of hell then put those beings on a bed of red-hot iron, which is burning, glowing, and all ablaze, forcing them to sit on it. 
They open their mouths with red￾hot iron pincers, and pour boiling molten copper into their mouths.$That boiling molten copper burns the lips.

[Just] as a clansman,$who shaves off his hair and beard, dons the robes of a monk, leaves home out of faith, and goes forth to practice the path [in order] to estab￾lish the unsurpassable holy life, [so too, may I] in that very life, per￾sonally attain understanding and awakening, and dwell having person￾ally realized it, knowing as it really is: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. 
There will not be another existence.”$In the past, King Yama had made this aspiration [while] in his pleasure park; and he recited these verses:$Reprimanded by the divine messengers,$A man who has been negligent,$Will feel distress and grief for a long time.$He is reckoned as hindered by harmful desires.$Reprimanded by the divine messengers,$A truly superior person,$Will not be negligent again,$[But will practice] the well-taught, wonderful, noble Dharma.$Seeing clinging causes him to be fearful,$And to aspire to the extinction of birth and old age.$[Once he is] free of clinging, [having] extinguished it without$ remainder,$That is the end of birth and old age.$That [person] attains the happiness of peace,$421$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Attains cessation in this lifetime,$Transcending all that is fearful,$And crossing over this worldly stream.$This is what the Buddha said.

^ck The Discourse with the$Raven Parable$Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha, in the$Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.$At that time, the World-honored One addressed the monks:$In the past, when a wheel-turning monarch wanted to test his jewel￾treasure, he assembled his fourfold army, that is, elephant troops, cav￾alry, chariot troops, and infantry. 
The fourfold army having been assem￾bled, in the dark of night, at midnight, a tall banner was raised, the jewel was placed on top of it, and it was taken out to the pleasure park.$The brilliance of the jewel illuminated the fourfold army, and its light extended over an area measuring half a league in [any] direction.$At that time, there was a brahmin who had this thought: “I would like to go and see the wheel-turning monarch, together with his fourfold army, and look at the beryl jewel.” Then that brahmin thought again,$“For the time being, never mind about visiting the wheel-turning monarch with his fourfold army, and looking at the beryl jewel. 
I would rather go into the forest.” So, the brahmin approached the forest. 
Having arrived there, he entered and went to the foot of a tree.$Not long after he had sat down, an otter came by. 
Seeing it, the brahmin asked, “Welcome, otter, where are you coming from and where do you want to go?”$[The otter] answered, “Brahmin, in earlier times this pond was fed to the brim by a clear spring, had many lotus roots and flowers,$and was full of fish and turtles. 
I formerly [lived] in dependence on it,$but now it has dried up. 
Brahmin, you should know that I want to leave it, to live in a large river. 
I want to leave now, I am afraid of people.”$422^taisho506b Division 6$Then, having had this exchange with the brahmin, the otter left.$The brahmin [remained] sitting there as before. 
Again, there came a jiu-mu bird.$164 Seeing it, the brahmin asked, “Welcome, jiu-mu bird,$where are you coming from and where do you want to go?”$[The bird] answered, “Brahmin, in earlier times this pond was fed to the brim by a clear spring, had many lotus roots and flowers, and was full of fish and turtles. 
I formerly [lived] in dependence on it, but now it has dried up. 
Brahmin, you should know that I want to leave it,$to nest in a place where dead cattle are collected and to live in depend￾ence on it, ...
or dead donkeys, ...
or to nest in a place where dead human beings are collected and to live in dependence on it. 
I want to leave now, I am afraid of people.”$Having had this exchange with the brahmin, the jiu-mu bird left.$The brahmin [remained] sitting there as before.$Again, there came a vulture. 
Seeing it, the brahmin asked, “Wel￾come, vulture, where are you coming from and where do you want to go?”$[The vulture] answered, “Brahmin, I am going from one large grave[yard] to another large grave[yard], places for [those who have been] harmed and killed. 
I now want to feed on the flesh of dead ele￾phants, dead horses, dead cattle, and dead human beings. 
I want to leave now, I am afraid of people.”$Then, having had this exchange with the brahmin, the vulture left.$The brahmin [remained] sitting there as before.$Again, there came a bird that feeds on vomit. 
Seeing it, the brahmin asked, “Welcome, bird that feeds on vomit, where are you coming from and where do you want to go?”$[The bird that feeds on vomit] answered, “Brahmin, did you see the vulture just now? I eat its vomit. 
I want to leave now, I am afraid of people.”$Having had this exchange with the brahmin, the bird that feeds on vomit left. 
The brahmin [remained] sitting there as before.$Again, there came a jackal. 
Having seen it, the brahmin asked,$“Welcome, jackal, where are you coming from and where do you want to go?”$423^taisho506c The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$[The jackal] answered, “Brahmin, I am going from one deep ravine to another deep ravine, from one dense jungle to another dense jungle,$and from one secluded place to another secluded place. 
I now want to feed on the flesh of dead elephants, dead horses, dead cattle, and dead human beings. 
I want to leave now, I am afraid of people.”$Then, having had this exchange with the brahmin, the jackal left.$The brahmin [remained] sitting there as before.$Again, there came a raven. 
Seeing it, the brahmin asked, “Welcome,$raven, where are you coming from and where do you want to go?”$[The raven] answered, “Brahmin, you crazy person, why do you ask me, ‘Where are you coming from and where do you want to go?’?”$Then, having reprimanded the brahmin to his face, the raven left.$The brahmin [remained] sitting there as before.$Again, there came an ape. 
Having seen it, the brahmin asked,$“Welcome, ape, where are you coming from and where do you want to go?”$[The ape] answered, “Brahmin, I am going from one garden to another garden, from one pleasure park to another pleasure park, from one forest to another forest, to drink at clear springs and eat good fruits.$I want to leave now, [though] I am not afraid of people.”$Having had this exchange with the brahmin, the ape left.$The Buddha told the monks:$I have delivered these parables and want [you] to understand their meaning. 
You should know that this teaching has a [deeper] meaning.$What is the meaning of the parable I delivered [that concludes with] “Then, having had this exchange with the brahmin, the otter left”?$Suppose there is a monk who lives in dependence on a village or town. 
At dawn this monk puts on his robes, takes his bowl, and enters the village to beg for food, without protecting himself, without guarding his sense faculties, without establishing right mindfulness. 
He never￾theless teaches the Dharma as taught by the Buddha or by one of [the$Buddha’s] disciples. 
Because of this he obtains the benefit of clothing and bedding, food and drink, bed and mattress, and medicine. 
He is$424^taisho507a Division 6$supplied with all [he needs] to live. 
Having obtained these benefits, he becomes attached to them, seduced by them, not seeing the danger in them, unable to relinquish them, using them as he wishes.$That monk practices bad conduct, develops unwholesome states,$goes to extremes, and gives rise to harm and decay. 
He is not living the holy life, yet claims [to be living the] holy life. 
He is not a renun￾ciant, yet claims [to be] a renunciant. 
It is just as [in the parable]: seeing the otter, the brahmin asked, “Welcome, otter, where are you coming from and where do you want to go?” [The otter] answered, “Brahmin,$in earlier times this pond was fed to the brim by a clear spring, had many lotus roots and flowers, and was full of fish and turtles. 
I formerly$[lived] in dependence on it, but now it has dried up. 
Brahmin, you should know that I want to leave it, to live in a large river. 
I now want to leave, I am afraid of people.”$The monk I spoke of is just like that. 
[He] is immersed in evil,$unwholesome, and defiled states that are the origin of future existence and have vexation and suffering as their fruit, being the cause of birth,$old age, disease, and death.$Therefore, monks, do not act like that otter; do not rely on what is against the Dharma for your livelihood. 
With pure conduct of body,$speech, and mind, dwell in secluded places, wear rag robes, always beg for food, begging for food in [proper] sequence [from house to house]. 
Be of few wishes and contented, abide happily, in detachment,$and practice energetically, establishing right mindfulness, right atten￾tiveness, right concentration, and right wisdom.

Those nuns then enter some houses to explain [what is] good and [what is] evil, accept the offerings of the$427^taisho507c The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$faithful, and bring them to the monk.

Be always detached and train in this way.$What isthe meaning of the parable I delivered [that concludes with],$“Then, having had this exchange with the brahmin, the jackal left”?$Suppose there is a monk who dwells in dependence on a poor vil￾lage. 
If he knows that within a certain village or walled town there are many companions in the holy life who are wise and energetic, then he keeps away from it. 
But if he knows that within that village or walled town there are no companions in the holy life who are wise and ener￾getic, then he comes and stays in it for nine months or for ten months.$On seeing him, monks ask, “Venerable friend, where are you dwelling?”$Then he answers, “Venerable friends, I am dwelling in dependence on such-and-such a poor village or town.”$Hearing this, the monks think, “This venerable one practices what is difficult to practice. 
Why is that? This venerable one is able to dwell$428$Division 6$in dependence on such-and-such a poor village or town.” The monks then all respect him, revere him, and provide him with food. 
Because of this he obtains the benefit of clothing and bedding, food and drink,$bed and mattress, and medicine, all [that he needs] to live.

Be of few wishes and contented, abide happily,$in detachment, and practice energetically, establishing right mindfulness,$right attentiveness, right concentration, and right wisdom. 
Be always detached and train in this way.$What is the meaning of the parable I delivered [that concludes with], “Then, having reprimanded the brahmin to his face, the raven left”?$Suppose there is a monk who spends the rains retreat in dependence on a poor and secluded place. 
If he knows that within a certain village or walled town there are many companions in the holy life who are wise and energetic, he keeps away from it. 
But if he knows that within that village or walled town there are no companions in the holy life who are wise and energetic, he comes and stays in it for two months$429^taisho508a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$or for three months. 
On seeing him, monks ask, “Venerable friend,$where are you passing the rains retreat?” Then he answers, “Venerable friends, I am passing the rains retreat in dependence on such-and-such a poor and secluded place. 
I am not like those fools who are equipped with a bed and provided with the five necessities, and live surrounded by them; who, whether before noon or after noon, whether after noon or before noon, have their mouths [ready to] savor tastes and have tastes [ready] to be savored by their mouths; who beg and demand again and again.”$Hearing this, those monks think, “This venerable one practices what is difficult to practice. 
Why is that? This venerable one is able to spend the rains retreat in dependence on such-and-such a poor and secluded place.” The monks then all respect, revere, and provide food$[for him]. 
Because of this he obtains the benefit of clothing and bedding,$food and drink, bed and mattress, and medicine, all [that he needs] to live.

Therefore, monks, do not act like that raven; do not rely on what is against the Dharma for your livelihood. 
With pure conduct of body, speech, and mind, dwell in secluded places, wear rag robes, always beg for food, and beg for food in [proper] sequence. 
Be of few wishes and contented, abide happily,$in detachment, and practice energetically, establishing right mindfulness,$right attentiveness, right concentration, and right wisdom. 
Be always detached and train in this way.$430^taisho508b Division 6$What is the meaning of the parable I delivered [that concludes with], “Then, having had this exchange with the brahmin, the ape left”?$Suppose there is a monk who lives in dependence on a village or town. 
At dawn this monk puts on his robes, takes his bowl, and enters the village to beg for food, with his body protected, with his sense fac￾ulties guarded, and with right mindfulness established. 
Having returned from begging for food in the village or town, and having finished his meal, put away his robe and bowl, and washed his hands and feet, in the afternoon he puts his sitting mat on his shoulder and goes to a secluded place, to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut. 
He arranges his sitting mat and sits down cross-legged, keeping his body straight,$with right intention, with mindfulness not scattered. 
[He] eliminates covetousness and has no avarice in his mind. 
On seeing another’s wealth and means of livelihood, he does not give rise to covetousness$[such as]: “I wish I could get [that].”$[Thus] he purifies his mind of covetousness. 
Likewise, [he purifies his mind of] hatred ...
sloth and torpor ...
restlessness and worry ...$[he] eliminates doubt and transcends perplexity in regard to wholesome states. 
[Thus] he purifies his mind of doubt. 
Having cut off these five hindrances, the imperfections of the mind that weaken wisdom, having abandoned desires, and evil and unwholesome states ...
(and so on up to) ...
he dwells having attained the fourth absorption.$When he has attained concentration in this way, his mind being purified, without blemish, free of vexation, malleable, well established,$having attained imperturbability, he directs his mind to the realization of the higher knowledge of the destruction of the taints.$He then knows as it really is: “This is suffering.” He knows as it really is: “This is the arising of suffering. 
This is the cessation of suf￾fering. 
This is the path [leading to] the cessation of suffering.” He knows as it really is: “These are the taints. 
This is the arising of the taints. 
This is the cessation of the taints. 
This is the path [leading to]$the cessation of the taints.” He knows it like this.$Seeing it like this, his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire, from the taint of existence, and from the taint of ignorance.$431$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Being liberated, he knows that he is liberated, and he knows as it really is: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. 
There will not be another existence.” It is as [in the parable]: seeing the ape, the brahmin asked, “Welcome, ape, where are you coming from and where do you want to go?” [The ape]$answered, “Brahmin, I am going from one garden to another garden,$from one pleasure park to another pleasure park, from one forest to another forest, to drink at clear springs and eat good fruits. 
I now want to leave, [though] I am not afraid of people.”$The monk I spoke of is just like that. 
Therefore, monks, do not act like that otter, do not act like that jiu-mu [bird], do not act like that vulture, do not act like that bird that feeds on vomit, do not act like that jackal, do not act like that raven. 
[You] should act like that ape.$Why is that? In this world a True Person, without attachment, is like that ape.$This is what the Buddha said. 
Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.$66. 
^ck The Discourse on Origins$Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Benares, in the$Deer Park, the Place of Seers.$At that time, the monks were seated together in the assembly hall after the midday meal on account of some small matter and had the following discussion:$Venerable friends, what do you say? Which is better for a lay fol￾lower—that a monk, who keeps the precepts of the sublime Dharma and is endowed with imposing deportment should enter his house to receive food, or that he [should gain] material benefits a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand times each day?$A certain monk said:$Venerable friends, what is the use of material benefits a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand times? Only this is important, namely that a monk who keeps the precepts of the sublime Dharma and is endowed$432^taisho508c Division 6$with imposing deportment should enter his house to receive food, not that [he should gain] material benefits a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand times each day.$At that time Venerable Anuruddha was seated among the assembly. 
Then the Venerable Anuruddha addressed the monks:$Venerable friends, what is the use of material benefits a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand times, or [even] more than that? Only this is important, namely that a monk who keeps the precepts of the sublime$Dharma and is endowed with imposing deportment should enter his house to receive food, not [that he should gain] material benefits a hun￾dred, a thousand, or ten thousand times a day. 
Why is that?$I recall how, in the distant past, I was a poor man in this country of Benares. 
I relied on gleaning to earn my living. 
At that time, the country of Benares was afflicted by drought, early frost, and locusts,$so [the crops] did not ripen. 
The people suffered from famine and alms￾food was difficult to obtain.$At that time, there was a paccekabuddha named Upariṭṭha,$165 who was living in dependence on Benares. 
Then, when the night was over,$at dawn, the paccekabuddha Upariṭṭha put on his robes, took his bowl,$and went into Benares to beg for food. 
At that time, in the morning, I$was going out of Benares to glean. 
Venerable friends, as I was going out, I saw the paccekabuddha Upariṭṭha coming in. 
Then the pacceka￾buddha Upariṭṭha, having come in carrying an empty bowl, went out$[again] with the bowl empty as before.$Venerable friends, at that time I was returning to Benares from gleaning, and saw the paccekabuddha Upariṭṭha going out again. 
Seeing me, he thought:$As I was coming in at dawn, I saw this person going out; now as$I am going out, I see this person again, coming in. 
This person may not yet have had his meal. 
Let me now follow this person.$Then the paccekabuddha followed me like a shadow following a form. 
Venerable friends, when I had got back home with my gleanings,$I put down what I had gathered, and turning around, I saw that the$433^taisho509a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$paccekabuddha Upariṭṭha had been following me like a shadow fol￾lowing a form. 
Seeing him, I thought:$As I was going out at dawn, I saw this seer entering the city to beg for food. 
Now this seer may not yet have obtained any food.$Let me forgo my own meal and give it to this seer!$Thinking this, I gave my meal to the paccekabuddha saying, “Seer,$you should know that this food is my portion. 
May you accept it out of compassion!”$Then the paccekabuddha replied to me saying:$Householder, you should know that this year [the country] is afflicted by drought, early frost, and locusts, [so] the five crops do not ripen. 
The people are suffering from famine and almsfood is difficult to obtain. 
Put half of [the food] into my bowl, and eat the other half yourself, so that [we] can both survive. 
That would be better.$I said further:$Seer, you should know that in my home I have a pot and a stove,$firewood, grains, and rice; moreover, I have no restrictions as to when I may eat and drink. 
Seer, out of compassion for me, accept the whole meal!$So the paccekabuddha accepted the whole meal out of compassion.$Venerable friends, because of the merit of giving him a bowlful of food, I was reborn in a heavenly realm seven times, becoming king of the gods; and I was reborn as a human being seven times, becoming the king of human beings. 
Venerable friends, because of the merit of giving him a bowlful of food, I was reborn in Sakya clans that were very wealthy and prosperous, possessing in abundance all kinds of livestock, feudatories, and manors, limitless wealth and endowed with valuable treasures.$Venerable friends, because of the merit of giving him a bowlful of food, I gave up kingship worth hundreds, thousands, millions of gold coins, not to mention various other possessions, and went forth$434$Division 6$to practice the path. 
Venerable friends, because of the merit of giving him a bowlful of food, I was regarded and treated with admiration by kings, ministers, brahmins, householders, and all the citizens, and was regarded with respect by the four assemblies of monks, nuns, male lay followers, and female lay followers.$Venerable friends, because of the merit of giving him a bowlful of food, I was constantly invited by people to accept food and drink,$clothing and bedding, woolen blankets, carpets, beds and mattresses,$shawls, medicine, and all [that is required for] living, and I never failed to receive invitations.$Had I known at that time that that renunciant was a True Person,$free of attachment, then the merit I gained would have been multiplied again. 
I would have received a great reward, the most excellent of ben￾efits, its bright splendor boundless and vast.$Then the Venerable Anuruddha, a True Person, free of attachment, who had attained right liberation, uttered this verse:$166$I recall how in the past I was poor,$Relying entirely on gleaning to earn a living.$Already short of food, I offered it to the renunciant$Upariṭṭha, of utmost virtue.$Because of this, I was reborn in the Sakya clan,$Given the name Anuruddha.$Knowing well how to sing and dance,$I made merry and constantly delighted [in it].$[Then] I got to see the World-honored One,$Fully awakened, [preaching the Dharma that is] like ambrosia.$When I saw him, confidence and joy arose in me,$And I gave up the household life to train in the path.$I attained the recollection of past lives,$Knowing my former births.$[I saw that] I was [previously] born among the thirty-three gods,$Dwelling there for seven [life]times.$435^taisho509b The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$I was [born] seven times here, in addition to the seven times there.$[Thus,] I had experienced fourteen [life]times$In the human realm and in the heavens,$Without ever descending into a bad realm.$I now [also] know the death and rebirth$Of beings, their destinations as they depart and are reborn.$I know [the states of] mind of others, right or wrong,$And the five kinds of enjoyment of the noble ones.$[Having] attained the fivefold absorption,$[By] constantly quieting and silencing the mind,$Having attained quiescence, rightly abiding,$I have gained the purified divine eye.$What is considered training in the path,$Secluded, having given up the household life,$I now have obtained its benefit,$And entered the sphere of the Buddha.$I take no delight in death,$Nor do I wish for rebirth.$When the time comes, when it is appropriate,$With right mindfulness and attentiveness established,$In the Bamboo Grove at Vesālī,$My life will end.$Beneath the bamboos of the grove,$[I shall attain] nirvana without remainder.$At that time, the World-honored One was sitting in meditation, and with the divine ear, which is purified and surpasses human [hearing], he heard the monks, sitting together in the assembly hall after the midday meal, discussing this topic.$Having heard it, in the late afternoon the World-honored One rose from sitting in meditation, went to the assembly hall and sat on a seat arranged before the assembly of monks. 
He asked the monks, “On account of what matter are you assembled in the assembly hall today?”$436^taisho509c Division 6$Then the monks answered:$World-honored One, we are assembled in the assembly hall today because Venerable Anuruddha was teaching the Dharma in relation to events of the past.$Then the World-honored One told the monks, “Would you like to hear the Tathāgata teach the Dharma in relation to an event of the future?”$The monks answered:$World-honored One, now is the right occasion. 
Well-gone One, now is the right occasion. 
If the World-honored One would teach the monks the Dharma in relation to an event of the future, the monks, hearing it,$will receive and remember it well.$The World-honored One said, “Listen carefully, monks. 
Listen carefully and pay proper attention, and I will explain it to you in full.”$Then the monks listened in order to receive instruction. 
The World-hon￾ored One said:$Monks, in the distant future the human life span will be eighty thousand years.$167 When the human life span is eighty thousand years, [this con￾tinent of] Jambudīpa will be very wealthy and pleasant, with many inhabitants; villages and cities will be as close [together] as a single cock’s flight. 
Monks, when the human life span is eighty thousand years, women will get married at the age of five hundred. 
Monks, when the human life span is eighty thousand years, there will be only such problems as [being afflicted by] cold or heat, [having to] defecate and urinate, [having sexual] desires, [having to] eat and drink, and old age.$There will be no other afflictions. 
Monks, when the human life span is eighty thousand years, there will be a king called Saṅkha, a wheel￾turning monarch, intelligent and wise, equipped with a fourfold army to reign over the entire world, freely, as he likes. 
Being a righteous$Dharma king, he will attain seven treasures. 
Those seven treasures are the wheel treasure, the elephant treasure, the horse treasure, the jewel treasure, the woman treasure, the steward treasure, and the counselor treasure—these are the seven. 
He will have a thousand sons, of hand￾some appearance, brave, fearless, and able to overcome others. 
He will$437$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$certainly rule over the whole earth, as far as the ocean, without relying on blade and cudgel, just by teaching the Dharma, bringing peace and happiness. 
He will have a great golden banner, gloriously decorated with various precious things, a thousand feet in height when raised,$and sixteen feet in circumference. 
He will have it set up; and after it has been set up, beneath it he will make offerings of food and drink,$clothes and bedding, vehicles, flower garlands, scattered flowers, per￾fume, dwellings, mattresses, woolen blankets, shawls, servants, and lamps, offering these to renunciants and brahmins, [as well as to] those in poverty, those without kin, and beggars from far away.$Having made these offerings, he will then shave off his hair and beard, don the yellow robe, leave the household life out of faith, and go forth to practice the path. 
[He will do like those] clansmen, who shave off their hair and beards, don the yellow robe, leave the household life out of faith, and go forth to practice the path until the unsurpassable holy life has been established. 
He will, in that lifetime, personally$[attain] understanding and awakening, and dwell having personally realized it. 
He will know as it really is: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. 
There will not be another existence.”$At that time Venerable Ajita was seated among the assembly. 
Then Ven￾erable Ajita rose from his seat, arranged his robe so as to bare one shoulder,$placed his palms together [in respect] toward the Buddha, and said:$World-honored One, in the distant future when the human life span is eighty thousand years, may I become a king called Saṅkha, a wheel￾turning monarch, intelligent and wise, equipped with a fourfold army to reign over the entire world, freely, as I like.

Having made these offerings,$I will then shave off my hair and beard, don the yellow robe, leave the household life out of faith, and go forth to practice the path. 
[I will do like those] clansmen, who shave off their hair and beards, don the yellow robe, leave the household life out of faith, and go forth to practice the path until the unsurpassable holy life has been established. 
I will,$in this very life, personally attain understanding and awakening, and dwell having personally realized it. 
I will understand as it really is:$“Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. 
There will not be another existence.”$Then the World-honored One reprimanded Venerable Ajita:$You foolish man, accepting to die one more time and [only] then trying to end it! Why is that? Because you have the thought:$World-honored One, in the distant future when the human life span is eighty thousand years, I will be a king called Saṅkha, a wheel-turning monarch, intelligent and wise, equipped with a four￾fold army to reign over the entire world, freely, as I like.

Then the World-honored One turned to him and said, “Ānanda,$bring me the robes woven with golden thread. 
I now wish to present them to the monk Metteyya.”$Then Venerable Ānanda, following the instruction of the World-honored$One, brought the robes woven with golden thread and gave them to the World￾honored One. 
Then, having received from Venerable Ānanda the robes woven with golden thread, the World-honored One said:$Metteyya, take these robes woven with golden thread from the Tathāgata and offer them to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the community of monks. 
Why? Metteyya, all Tathāgatas, free from attachment and fully awakened, are the protectors of the world, seeking its prosperity, benefit,$peace, and happiness.$Then Venerable Metteyya, having taken the robes woven with golden thread from the Tathāgata, offered them to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the community of monks.$At that time, Māra the Bad had this thought:$The renunciant Gotama, who is staying at Benares, in the Deer Park,$the Place of Seers, is teaching his disciples the Dharma for the sake of the future. 
Let me go and hinder and confuse them.$Then Māra the Bad approached the Buddha. 
Having arrived there, he recited a verse to the Buddha:$One will certainly attain$The most wonderful appearance$Wearing flower garlands and jade necklaces on one’s body$And brilliant pearls on ones arms,$If one stays in the town of Ketumatī,$In the realm of King Saṅkha.$445^taisho511b The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Thereupon the World-honored One thought: “This Māra the Bad has come here, wanting to hinder and confuse [my disciples].” Knowing [this],$the World-honored One recited a verse to Māra the Bad:$One will certainly attain [the state]$Free of oppression, free of doubt and delusion,$Eradicating birth, old age, disease, and death,$[Attaining] freedom from the taints, completing what has to be done,$If one practices the holy life$In the realm of Metteyya.$Then Māra the Bad again recited a verse:$One will certainly obtain$Fame and superior, excellent clothes$Sandalwood [oil] to apply to the body,$And an even, straight, beautiful, and slender body,$If one stays in the town of Ketumatī,$In the realm of King Saṅkha.$Then, the World-honored One again recited a verse:$One will certainly attain [the state] of$Non-ownership and homelessness,$Holding no golden treasures in his hands,$Free from activity, with nothing to fear,$If one practices the holy life$In the realm of Metteyya.$Then Māra the Bad again recited a verse:$One will certainly obtain$Fame, wealth, and fine food and drink.$Knowing well how to sing and dance,$[One] will make merry and constantly delight [in it].$If one stays in the town of Ketumatī,$In the realm of King Saṅkha.$Then, the World-honored One again recited a verse:$446^taisho511c Division 6$One will certainly cross to the other shore,$As a bird breaks a net and escapes,$And achieve absorption, abiding in it freely,$Possessed of happiness, always joyful.$Māra, you must know$That I have overcome [you].$Then King Māra thought: “The World-honored One knows me. 
The$Well-gone One has seen me.” Anxious, worried, aggrieved, and unable to remain there, he suddenly disappeared from that place.$This is what the Buddha said. 
Having heard the Buddha’s words,$Metteyya, Ajita, the venerable Ānanda, and the [other] monks were delighted and remembered them well.$67. 
^ck The Discourse on Mahādeva’s$Mango Grove168$Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying in the country of$Videha together with a large company of monks. 
They approached Mithilā$and stayed in Mahādeva’s Mango Grove. 
On that occasion, while on the jour￾ney, the World-honored One smiled joyfully.$Venerable Ānanda, on seeing the World-honored One smile, placed his palms together [in respect] toward the Buddha and said:$World-honored One, what is the reason for this smile? Tathāgatas, free from attachment and fully awakened, do not smile randomly, for no reason. 
May I hear the meaning [of this smile].$Then the World-honored One told him:$Ānanda, in the distant past, in a different era, there was in this Mango$Grove at Mithilā a king named Mahādeva. 
He was a wheel-turning monarch, intelligent and wise, equipped with a fourfold army to reign over the entire world, freely, as he liked. 
Being a righteous Dharma king he possessed seven treasures and had acquired four kinds of suc￾cess.$Ānanda, what were the seven treasures that King Mahādeva pos￾sessed? They were the wheel treasure, the elephant treasure, the horse$447^taisho512a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$treasure, the jewel treasure, the woman treasure, the steward treasure,$and the counselor treasure—these were the seven.$Ānanda, what is reckoned to be King Mahādeva’s possession of the wheel treasure? Ānanda, at one time on the fifteenth day of the$[half-]month, the time for reciting the code of rules, after having bathed,$King Mahādeva ascended to the main hall. 
[Then] the divine wheel treasure manifested, coming from the east. 
It had a thousand spokes,$was complete in every aspect, pure and natural, not man-made, flamelike in color, bright and shining.$On seeing it, King Mahādeva delighted and rejoiced, thinking to himself:$The auspicious wheel treasure has arisen! The wonderful wheel treasure has arisen! I heard from the ancients thus: if a duly anointed khattiya king, on the fifteenth day of the [half-]month, the time for reciting the code of rules, after having bathed, ascends to the main hall, and the divine wheel treasure manifests, coming from the east, with a thousand spokes, complete in every aspect, pure and natural, not man-made, flamelike in color, bright and shining,$then he will become a wheel-turning monarch. 
Will I not be a wheel-turning monarch?$Ānanda, in those former times, when King Mahādeva wanted to test for himself the divine wheel treasure, he assembled his fourfold army,$namely elephant troops, cavalry, chariot troops, and infantry. 
Having assembled his fourfold army, he approached the divine wheel treasure.$He placed his left hand on the wheel and rotated it with his right hand,$saying [to his fourfold army]: “Follow the divine wheel treasure! Follow the divine wheel treasure wherever it goes!”$Ānanda, the divine wheel treasure rolled and moved toward the east and King Mahādeva followed it himself, together with his fourfold army. 
Wherever the divine wheel treasure stopped, there King Mahā-$deva took up residence with his fourfold army.$Then the kings of the small countries in the east all approached$King Mahādeva and said:$448$Division 6$Welcome, your majesty! Your majesty, these lands, which are extremely large, rich, pleasant, and with many inhabitants, all belong to your majesty. 
May your majesty teach them the Dharma!$We shall assist your majesty.$Thereupon King Mahādeva told those minor kings:$Each of you should rule his own territory by the Dharma, not by what is against the Dharma. 
Let your country be free of evil actions and of people of impure behavior!$Ānanda, the divine wheel treasure passed through the east and crossed the eastern ocean. 
Then it turned to the south ...
to the west ...
to the north...
.$Ānanda, as the divine wheel treasure rolled and moved on, King$Mahādeva followed it himself, together with his fourfold army. 
Wher￾ever the divine wheel treasure stopped, there King Mahādeva took up residence with his fourfold army. 
Then the kings of the small countries in the north all approached King Mahādeva and said:$Welcome, your majesty! Your majesty, these lands, which are extremely rich and pleasant, with many inhabitants, all belong to your majesty. 
May your majesty teach them the Dharma! We shall assist your majesty.$Thereupon King Mahādeva told those minor kings:$Each of you should rule his own territory by the Dharma, not by what is against the Dharma. 
Let your country be free of evil actions and of people of impure behavior!$Ānanda, the divine wheel treasure passed through the north and crossed the northern ocean. 
Then it quickly returned to its point of departure in the royal capital. 
While King Mahādeva was sitting in the main hall managing his properties, the divine wheel treasure remained in the sky. 
Such is reckoned to be King Mahādeva’s possession of the divine wheel treasure.$Ānanda, what is reckoned to be King Mahādeva’s possession of$449^taisho512b The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$the elephant treasure? Ānanda, at one time the elephant-treasure appeared to King Mahādeva. 
That elephant was completely white and had the seven limbs.$169 The elephant was named Usabha.$170 Having seen it, King Mahādeva delighted and rejoiced, [thinking:] “If it can be tamed, let it be made thoroughly virtuous and good.” Afterward,$Ānanda, King Mahādeva said to his elephant trainer: “Quickly tame the elephant and make it thoroughly well trained. 
Come and report to me when the elephant is trained.”$Then, following the king’s instructions, the elephant trainer approached the elephant treasure, quickly controlled the elephant treas￾ure, and made it thoroughly well trained. 
At that time the elephant treasure was thoroughly controlled and tamed, and quickly became well trained. 
Just as in ancient times a fine elephant with a life span of countless hundreds and thousands of years had been thoroughly con￾trolled and tamed and quickly became well trained for countless hun￾dreds and thousands of years, so the elephant treasure was also thor￾oughly controlled and tamed and quickly became well trained.$Ānanda, at that time the elephant trainer, having quickly controlled the elephant treasure, made it thoroughly well trained. 
And having trained the elephant treasure, he approached King Mahādeva and said:$“May your majesty know that I have thoroughly controlled and tamed the elephant treasure and it has been trained. 
It is at your majesty’s disposal.”$Ānanda, in those former times, when King Mahādeva tested the elephant treasure, he approached the elephant treasure in the morning as the sun rose. 
Mounting the elephant treasure, he traveled all over the land as far as the ocean, then quickly returned to his point of depar￾ture in the royal capital. 
Such is reckoned to be King Mahādeva’s pos￾session of the white elephant treasure.$Ānanda, what is reckoned to be King Mahādeva’s possession of the horse treasure? Ānanda, at one time the horse treasure appeared to$King Mahādeva. 
The horse treasure was completely dark blue in color,$with a head like a crow, with its body adorned with hair, and was named$“King Hairy-horse.” Seeing it, King Mahādeva delighted and rejoiced,$[thinking:] “If it can be tamed, let it be made thoroughly virtuous and$450^taisho512c Division 6$good.” Afterward, Ānanda, King Mahādeva said to his horse trainer:$“Quickly tame the horse and make it thoroughly well trained. 
Come and report to me when the horse is trained.”$Then, following the king’s instructions, the horse trainer approached the horse treasure, quickly controlled the horse treasure, and made it thoroughly well trained. 
At that time the horse treasure was thoroughly controlled and tamed, and quickly became well trained. 
Just as in ancient times a fine horse with a life span of countless hundreds and thousands of years had been thoroughly controlled and tamed and quickly became well trained for countless hundreds and thousands of years, so the horse treasure was also thoroughly controlled and tamed and quickly became well trained.$Ānanda, at that time the horse trainer, having quickly controlled the horse treasure, made it thoroughly well trained. 
And having trained the horse treasure, he approached King Mahādeva and said: “May your majesty know that I have thoroughly controlled and tamed the horse treasure and it has been trained. 
It is at your majesty’s disposal.”$Ānanda, in those former times, when King Mahādeva tested the horse treasure, he approached the horse treasure in the morning as the sun rose. 
Mounting the horse treasure, he traveled all over the land as far as the ocean, then quickly returned to his point of departure in the royal capital. 
Such is reckoned to be King Mahādeva’s possession of the dark blue horse treasure.$Ānanda, what is reckoned to be King Mahādeva’s possession of the jewel treasure? Ānanda, at one time the jewel treasure appeared to$King Mahādeva. 
The jewel treasure was bright and pure, natural, not artificial, eight-faceted, without any flaw, very well polished, and was strung on a thread of five colors, namely, blue, yellow, red, white, and black. 
Ānanda, at that time King Mahādeva wanted a lamp to light the inner hall of his palace, so he used the jewel treasure.$Ānanda, in those former times, when King Mahādeva tested hisjewel treasure, he assembled hisfourfold army, that is, elephant troops, cavalry,$chariot troops, and infantry. 
The fourfold army having been assembled,$in the dark of night a tall banner was raised, the jewel was placed on top of it, and it was taken out to the pleasure park. 
The brilliance of$451$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$the jewel illuminated the fourfold army, and its light extended over an area measuring half a league in [any] direction. 
Such is reckoned to be King Mahādeva’s possession of the bright jewel treasure.$Ānanda, what is reckoned to be King Mahādeva’s possession of the woman treasure? Ānanda, at one time the woman treasure appeared to King Mahādeva. 
The woman treasure had a lustrous body, splendid and pure, with a beauty surpassing that of human beings, almost like a goddess. 
Her appearance was graceful, and whoever saw her would be pleased. 
From her mouth came forth the fragrant scent of blue lotuses, and from the pores of her body came forth the scent of san￾dalwood. 
Her body was warm in winter and cool in summer. 
This woman sincerely served the king, her words were pleasant, and her behavior was agile, intelligent, and wise. 
She rejoiced in doing good.$She was attentive to the king and always attached to him in thought,$not to mention in bodily actions and words. 
Such is reckoned to be$King Mahādeva’s possession of the beautiful woman treasure.$Ānanda, what is [reckoned to be] King Mahādeva’s possession of the steward treasure? Ānanda, at one time the steward treasure appeared to King Mahādeva. 
The steward treasure was extremely rich,$with immeasurable wealth, and possessed in abundance all kinds of livestock, feudatories, and manors. 
He was endowed in various ways with the results of meritorious actions, and had thereby acquired the divine eye. 
He saw all treasure vaults, [knowing] whether they were empty or not, guarded or not. 
He saw hoards of gold, hoards of coin,$wrought treasure and unwrought treasure. 
Ānanda, the steward treasure approached King Mahādeva and said: “If your majesty wishes to have hoards of gold and coin, please do not worry. 
I will know the [right]$time.”$Ānanda, in those former times, when King Mahādeva tested the steward treasure, he boarded a boat, pulled out into the Ganges River,$and said: “Steward, I want to have hoards of gold and coin.” The stew￾ard said: “May your majesty have the boat pull in to shore!” Then King$Mahādeva said: “Steward, I want to have them right here! I want to have them right here!” The steward said: “Then may your majesty have the boat stop!”$452^taisho513a Division 6$Then, Ānanda, the steward treasure moved to the front of the boat.$Kneeling down and reaching out with his hands, he drew up four coffers from the water, a coffer [filled] with gold, a coffer with coins, a coffer with wrought [treasure], and a coffer with unwrought [treasure]. 
He said: “May your majesty do with them as he wishes! The hoards of gold and coin are at your disposal. 
After you have made use of them,$the remainder will be returned to the water.” Such is reckoned to be$King Mahādeva’s possession of the steward treasure.$Ānanda, what is [reckoned to be] King Mahādeva’s possession of the counselor treasure? Ānanda, at one time the counselor treasure appeared to King Mahādeva. 
The counselor treasure was intelligent,$wise, eloquent, knowledgeable, and discriminating. 
For King Mahādeva the counselor treasure established [policies for] the benefit of the present generation and encouraged peace and stability for it, for King Mahā-$deva he established [policies for] the benefit of future generations and encouraged peace and stability for them. 
He planned for the benefit of present and future generations and encouraged peace and stability for them.$For King Mahādeva the counselor treasure assembled and dis￾missed the army as the king wished. 
He desired to prevent King Mahā-$deva’s fourfold army from becoming fatigued and aimed to help. 
He did the same in regard to the officials. 
Such is reckoned to be King$Mahādeva’s possession of the counselor treasure. 
These, Ānanda, are reckoned to be the seven treasures that King Mahādeva possessed.$Ānanda, what are the four kinds of success acquired by King$Mahādeva? King Mahādeva had an extremely long life span. 
As a prince, he played games for eighty-four thousand years. 
He was the king of a small country for eighty-four thousand years, and the king of a large country for eighty-four thousand years. 
[Then,] having shaved off his hair and beard, donned the yellow robe, left home out of faith,$and gone forth, he practiced the path for eighty-four thousand years.$As a royal sage,$171 he practiced the holy life, dwelling here at Mithilā$in Mahādeva’s Mango Grove.$Ānanda, that King Mahādeva had an extremely long life span;$[that] as a prince, he played games for eighty-four thousand years;$453^taisho513b The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$[that] he was king of a small country for eighty-four thousand years,$and king of a large country for eighty-four thousand years; [that] having shaved off his hair and beard, donned the yellow robe, left home out of faith, and gone forth, he practiced the path for eighty-four thousand years; [that] as a royal sage, he practiced the holy life, dwelling here at Mithilā in Mahādeva’s Mango Grove—this is reckoned to be the first kind of success of King Mahādeva.$Again, Ānanda, King Mahādeva was free of illness, he was endowed with an even digestion, [his digestion became] neither [too]$cold nor [too] hot, [was] comfortable and non-afflictive, so that whatever he ate and drank was well digested. 
Ānanda, that King Mahādeva was free of illness, that he had developed a balanced manner of eating, [he ate things] neither too hot not too cold, comfortable and peaceful, so that whatever he ate and drank was well digested—this is reckoned to be the second kind of success of King Mahādeva.$Again, Ānanda, King Mahādeva had a lustrous body, splendid and pure, with a beauty surpassing that of human beings, almost like a god. 
He was graceful and handsome, so that whoever saw him was pleased. 
Ānanda, that King Mahādeva had a lustrous body, fresh and bright, with a beauty surpassing that of human beings, almost like a god; and that he was graceful and handsome, so that whoever saw him was pleased—this is reckoned to be the third kind of success of$King Mahādeva.$Again, Ānanda, King Mahādeva always had thoughts of affection for brahmins and householders, just as a father thinks of his children;$and the brahmins and householders, too, greatly respected King Mahā-$deva, just as children respect their father. 
Ānanda, once while in his pleasure park, King Mahādeva told his charioteer, “Drive slowly. 
I$wish to see the brahmins and householders longer.” The brahmins and householders, too, told their charioteers, “Drive slowly. 
We wish to see King Mahādeva longer.”$Ānanda, that King Mahādeva always had thoughts of affection for brahmins and householders just as a father thinks of his children;$and that the brahmins and householders, too, greatly respected King$Mahādeva, just as children respect their father—this is reckoned to be$454$Division 6$the fourth kind of success of King Mahādeva. 
These, Ānanda, are reck￾oned to be the four kinds of success that King Mahādeva had acquired.$Ānanda, at a later time King Mahādeva told his barber, “If you see gray hairs growing on my head, then tell me.” Thereupon, after some time, while washing the king’s head, the barber saw that some gray hairs had grown. 
Following the king’s instructions, on seeing them he said: “May your majesty know that the divine messengers have arrived! Gray hairs are growing on your head.” King Mahādeva told his barber, “Pull out the gray hairs gently with golden tweezers and place them in my hand!”$Then, following the king’s instructions, the barber pulled out the gray hairs gently with golden tweezers and placed them in the king’s hand. 
Ānanda, holding the gray hairs in his hand, King Mahādeva said in verse:$Gray hairs are growing on my head.$My life is going into decline.$The divine messengers have come.$It is time for me to practice the path.$Ānanda, having seen the gray hairs, King Mahādeva told the crown prince:$Crown prince, you should know that the divine messengers have come; gray hairs are growing on my head.

Like￾wise, you should in turn pass on this transmitted Dharma. 
Do not let the people fall into extremes”? Crown prince, if in this country this transmission of Dharma is broken and no longer continues,$this is reckoned to be “letting the people fall into extremes.”$For this reason, crown prince, I now pass [this Dharma] on to you. 
Crown prince, as I have passed this transmitted Dharma on to you, you should in turn likewise pass on this transmitted$Dharma. 
Do not let the people fall into extremes!$Ānanda, having entrusted the country’s affairs to the crown prince and instructed him properly, King Mahādeva shaved off his hair and beard,$donned the yellow robe, left home out of faith, and went forth to practice the path. 
As a royal sage, he practiced the holy life, dwelling here at$Mithilā, in King Mahādeva’s Mango Grove.$[The crown prince] also became a wheel-turning monarch, pos￾sessing the seven treasures, and acquiring the four kinds of success.$What are the seven treasures that he possessed and the four kinds of success that he acquired? ...

Do not let the peo￾ple fall into extremes”? Crown prince, if in this country this trans￾mission of Dharma is broken and no longer continues, this is reck￾oned to be “letting the people fall into extremes.”$For this reason, crown prince, I now pass [this Dharma] on to you. 
Crown prince, as I have passed this transmitted Dharma$457$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$on to you, you should in turn likewise pass on this transmitted$Dharma. 
Do not let the people fall into extremes!$Ānanda, having entrusted the country’s affairs to the crown prince and instructed him properly, the wheel-turning monarch shaved off his hair and beard, donned the yellow robe, left home out of faith, and went forth to practice the path. 
As a royal sage, he practiced the holy life, dwelling here at Mithilā in King Mahādeva’s Mango Grove. 
Thus,$Ānanda, from son to son, from grandson to grandson, from generation to generation, from tradition to tradition,$172 eighty-four thousand wheel-turning monarchs in succession shaved off their hair and beards,$donned the yellow robe, left home out of faith, and went forth to prac￾tice the path. 
As royal sages, they practiced the holy life, dwelling here at Mithilā, in King Mahādeva’s Mango Grove. 
The last of those kings, named Nimi, was a righteous Dharma king, who practiced the$Dharma in accordance with the Dharma.$He held a Dharma feast$173 for the sake of his crown prince, queen,$concubines, maids, subjects, renunciants, brahmins and [all sentient beings] including insects, on the eighth day and the fourteenth and fif￾teenth days of each [half-]month, when he practiced charity, providing those in need, the renunciants and brahmins, [as well as] those in poverty, those without kin, and beggars from far away, with food and drink, clothes and bedding, vehicles, flower garlands, scattered flowers,$perfume, dwellings, mattresses, woolen blankets, shawls, servants, and lamps.$At that time, the thirty-three gods, who were sitting together in the Sudhamma Hall, extolled and praised King Nimi thus:$Friends, the people of Videha are endowed with great benefits and great merits. 
Why is that? The last [of their] kings, named Nimi,$is a righteous Dharma king who practices the Dharma according to the Dharma. 
He holds a Dharma feast for the sake of his crown prince, queen, concubines, maids, subjects, renunciants, brahmins,$and [all sentient beings] including insects, on the eighth day and the fourteenth and fifteenth days of each [half-]month, when he practices charity, providing those in need, the renunciants and$458^taisho514b Division 6$brahmins, [as well as] those in poverty, those without kin, and beggars from far away, with food and drink, clothes and bedding,$vehicles, flower garlands, scattered flowers, perfume, dwellings,$mattresses, woolen blankets, shawls, servants, and lamps.$At that time Sakka, king of the gods, was also among them. 
Then$Sakka, king of the gods, addressed the thirty-three gods, “Friends,$would you like to see King Nimi right here?”$The thirty-three gods replied, “Kosiya, we would like to see King$Nimi right here.”$At that time, just as quickly as a strong man might bend or stretch his arm, Sakka suddenly vanished from the heaven of the thirty-three and arrived at King Nimi’s palace.$There, having seen Sakka, king of the gods, King Nimi asked,$“Who are you?”$Sakka replied, “Great king, have you heard of Sakka, king of the gods?”$He replied, “Yes, I have heard of Sakka.”$Sakka said:$I am he. 
Great king, you are endowed with great benefits and great merits.

The great king can board that char￾iot and enjoy the ride while ascending to heaven.$Then King Nimi expressed his assent to Sakka, king of the gods, by remaining silent. 
Sakka, understanding that King Nimi had assented by remaining silent, just as quickly as a strong man might bend or stretch his arm, suddenly vanished from King Nimi’s palace and returned to the heaven of the thirty-three.$Having arrived, Sakka told the charioteer:$Quickly prepare a chariot drawn by a thousand elephants and go to receive King Nimi. 
Having arrived, you should say: “Great king, may you know that Sakka, king of the gods, has sent this chariot drawn by a thousand elephants to receive you! May you board this chariot and enjoy the ride while ascending to heaven!”$After the king has boarded the chariot, you should ask: “By which route would you like me to drive you: by the route on which evil￾doers experience the results of evil or by the route on which doers of good experience the results of good?”$Thereupon, following Sakka’s instructions, the charioteer prepared a chariot drawn by a thousand elephants and went to King Nimi. 
Having arrived there, he said:$Great king, may you know that Sakka has sent this chariot drawn by a thousand elephants to receive you! May you board this chariot and enjoy the ride while ascending to heaven!$Then, after King Nimi had boarded the chariot, the charioteer addressed the king again:$By which route would you like me to drive you: by the route on which evildoers experience the results of evil or by the route on which doers of good experience the results of good?$460$Division 6$Then King Nimi told the charioteer:$You may drive me between the two routes: [the route on which]$evildoers experience the results of evil and [the route on which]$doers of good experience the results of good.$So the charioteer drove the king between the two routes: [the route on which] evildoers experience the results of evil and [the route on which]$doers of good experience the results of good.$Then the thirty-three gods saw King Nimi coming in the distance.$Seeing him, they praised him, [saying:] “Welcome, great king! Wel￾come, great king! May you dwell together with the thirty-three gods and enjoy yourself!”$Then King Nimi addressed the thirty-three gods in verse:$Just like riding in a borrowed chariot,$A vehicle acquired temporarily,$So is this place;$That is to say, it belongs to others.$I shall return to Mithilā,$[Where] I shall do immeasurable good,$Because this results in rebirth in heaven.$Making merit is provision [for rebirth in heaven].$Ānanda, do you regard King Mahādeva on that former occasion as someone other [than me]? Do not think like this! You should know that he was me.$Ānanda, on that former occasion I and the eighty-four thousand wheel-turning monarchs descending from me in succession—from son to son, from grandson to grandson, from generation to generation—$shaved off our hair and beards, donned the yellow robe, left home out of faith, and went forth to practice the path.As royal sages, we practiced the holy life dwelling here at Mithilā in King Mahādeva’s Mango Grove.$Ānanda, at that time I benefited myself, benefited others, and ben￾efited many people. 
I had compassion for the whole world and I sought prosperity, benefit, peace and happiness for gods and human beings.$The teaching I gave at that time did not lead to the ultimate, was not$461^taisho515a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$the ultimate purity, not the ultimate holy life, not the ultimate completion of the holy life. 
Not having fulfilled the holy life, I did not at that time become free from birth, old age, sickness, death, sorrow, and distress,$and I was not able to attain liberation from all suffering.$Ānanda, I have now appeared in this world as a Tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened, perfect in knowledge and conduct,$a Well-gone One, a knower of the world, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and human beings, a buddha, a Fortunate$One.$I now benefit myself, benefit others, benefit many people. 
I have compassion for the whole world, and I seek prosperity, benefit, peace,$and happiness for gods and human beings. 
My teaching of the Dharma has now reached fulfillment, I have fulfilled my purification, fulfilled the holy life. 
Having fulfilled the holy life, I am now free from birth,$old age, sickness, death, sorrow, and distress. 
I have now attained lib￾eration from all suffering.$Ānanda, I now pass on to you this transmitted Dharma. 
Likewise,$you should in turn pass on this transmitted Dharma. 
Do not let the$Buddha’s lineage be broken! What is this transmitted Dharma that I$now pass on to you, this transmitted Dharma that you should in turn pass on, not letting the Buddha’s lineage be broken? Ānanda, it is the noble eightfold path consisting of right view ...

This, Ānanda, is the transmitted Dharma that I$now pass on to you, the transmitted Dharma that you should in turn pass on, not letting the Buddha’s lineage be broken.$This is what the Buddha said.$Having heard the Buddha’s words, Venerable Ānanda and the [other]$monks were delighted and remembered them well.$68. 
^ck The Discourse on$Mahāsudassana174$Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Kusinārā, staying in the Sāla Grove of the Mallas at Upavattana.$At that time the World-honored One, who was about to attain final nir￾vana, said:$462^taisho515b Division 6$Ānanda, go to the twin sāla trees and prepare a bed for the Tathāgata between the trees with its head toward the north. 
The Tathāgata will attain final nirvana at midnight.$Following the Tathāgata’s instruction, Venerable Ānanda went to the twin trees and prepared a bed for the Tathāgata, between the twin trees with its head toward the north. 
Having prepared the bed, he returned to where the$Buddha was. 
After making obeisance with his head at the Buddha’s feet, he stood to one side and said:$World-honored One, I have prepared a bed for the Tathāgata between the twin trees with its head toward the north. 
May the World-honored$One know the [right] time!$Then the World-honored One, together with Venerable Ānanda,$approached the place between the twin trees. 
He folded his outer robe in four and placed it on the bed, folded the inner robe to use as a pillow, and lay down on his right side, one foot on the other, ready to attain final nirvana. 
At that time Venerable Ānanda, holding a fly whisk, was attending on the Buddha.$Venerable Ānanda placed his palms together [in respect] toward the$Buddha and said:$World-honored One, there are also great cities, such as Campā, Sāvatthī,$Vesālī, Rājagaha, Benares, and Kapilavatthu. 
Rather than attaining final nirvana in [one of] these cities, why is the World-honored One$[attaining final nirvana] in this small mud-built town, this lowliest of all towns?$Then the World-honored One said:$Ānanda, do not call this “a small mud-built town, the lowliest of all towns.” Why is that? In the past, this Kusinārā was called “the royal city of Kusinārā.” It was extremely rich and pleasant, with many inhab￾itants.

The silver bells had golden clappers. 
The beryl bells had crystal clappers. 
The crystal bells had beryl clappers.$Ānanda, when the great palace, the flower pond, and the grove of palm trees had been completed in this way, the kings of the eighty-four$468^taisho516c Division 6$thousand small countries went together to King Mahāsudassana and said:$May your majesty know that the great palace, the flower pond,$and the grove of palm trees have all been completed! They are at your majesty’s disposal.$Then, Ānanda, King Mahāsudassana thought:$I should not be the first to ascend to this great palace. 
There are most highly regarded renunciants and brahmins living in this royal city of Kusinārā. 
Let me invite them all to sit together in this great palace. 
I will have delicious, wonderful, delicate food prepared,$various rich food to eat, savor and digest, and serve it with my own hands, making sure everybody will eat his fill. 
After the meal is finished, the utensils have been cleared away, and water for washing has been offered, they will be dismissed and allowed to return.$Ānanda, having thought thus, King Mahāsudassana invited all of the most highly regarded renunciants and brahmins living in that royal city of Kusinārā to ascend to the great palace. 
Having had them seated,$[the king] himself brought water for washing. 
Then delicious, wonderful,$delicate food was brought. 
And with his own hands he served the various rich food to eat, savor and digest, making sure everybody ate his fill. 
After the meal was finished, the utensils had been cleared away,$and water for washing had been offered, [the king], having received a blessing, dismissed them and allowed them to return.$Ānanda, again King Mahāsudassana thought:$It would not be proper for me to engage in sensual pleasures in the great palace. 
Let me rather take a single attendant and ascend to the great palace and reside there.$Ānanda, King Mahāsudassana therefore took a single attendant and ascended to the great palace. 
Then he entered a golden building and sat on a silver royal couch, which was covered with woolen blankets,$draped with brocades and fine silk fabric, with lined and quilted cov￾erlets, and with cushions [made of] antelope hide at both ends. 
After$469^taisho517a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$sitting down, separated from desires, separated from evil and unwhole￾some states, he dwelled having attained the first absorption, which is accompanied by initial and sustained application of mind, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.$He came out of the golden building and entered a silver building.$He sat on a golden royal couch, which was covered with woolen blan￾kets, draped with brocades and fine silk fabric, with lined and quilted coverlets, and with cushions [made of] antelope hide at both ends.$After sitting down, separated from desires, separated from evil and unwholesome states, he dwelled having attained the first absorption,$which is accompanied by initial and sustained application of mind,$with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.$He came out of the silver building and entered a beryl building.$He sat on a crystal royal couch, which was covered with woolen blan￾kets, draped with brocades and fine silk fabric, with lined and quilted coverlets, and with cushions [made of] antelope hide at both ends.$After sitting down, separated from desires, separated from evil and unwholesome states, he dwelled having attained the first absorption,$which is accompanied by initial and sustained application of mind,$with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.$He came out of the beryl building and entered a crystal building.$He sat on a beryl royal couch, which was covered with woolen blankets,$draped with brocades and fine silk fabric, with lined and quilted cov￾erlets, and with cushions [made of] antelope hide at both ends.

Therefore, his eighty-four thousand wives approached the woman treasure and said:$Your majesty, may you know that we have not had an audience with the great king for a long time. 
Your majesty, we now wish to$[go and] see the great king together.$470$Division 6$Having heard that, the woman treasure told the counselor treasure,$“May you know that we have not had an audience with the great king for a long time. 
We now wish to go and see him.”$On hearing this, the counselor treasure accompanied the [king’s]$eighty-four thousand wives and the woman treasure to the great palace.$They were also escorted by eighty-four thousand elephants, eighty￾four thousand horses, eighty-four thousand chariots, eighty-four thou￾sand infantry troops, and eighty-four thousand minor kings. 
As they approached, they produced a tremendous noise, reverberating [all around]. 
King Mahāsudassana heard the tremendous noise, reverberating$[all around].$Hearing it, he asked the attendant at his side, “Who is making that tremendous noise, reverberating [all around]?”$The attendant said:$Your majesty, it is being made by your eighty-four thousand wives and the woman treasure, who are all coming to the great palace;$the eighty-four thousand elephants, eighty-four thousand horses,$eighty-four thousand chariots, eighty-four thousand infantry troops,$and eighty-four thousand minor kings are also coming together to the great palace; consequently there is this tremendous noise,$reverberating [all around].$On hearing this, King Mahāsudassana told the attendant, “Descend from the palace immediately and promptly prepare a golden couch out of doors. 
Return and tell me when this is finished.”$Following these instructions, the attendant descended from the palace and promptly prepared a golden couch out of doors. 
When he had finished,$he returned and said, “I have finished preparing a golden couch out of doors for your majesty. 
It is at your majesty’s disposal.” Then, Ānanda,$King Mahāsudassana, accompanied by the attendant, descended from the palace and sat down cross-legged on the golden couch.$Then, Ānanda, King Mahāsudassana’s eighty-four thousand wives and the woman-treasure all advanced toward him. 
Ānanda, King Mahā-$sudassana saw his eighty-four thousand wives and the woman treasure in the distance. 
Having seen them, he swiftly restrained his senses.$471^taisho517b The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Then, having noticed that the king had restrained his senses, his eighty￾four thousand wives and the woman treasure thought, “His majesty must have no need of us. 
Why is that? His majesty restrained his senses as soon as he saw us.”$Thereupon, Ānanda, the woman treasure approached King Mahā-$sudassana. 
Having arrived, she said:$May your majesty know that these eighty-four thousand wives and the woman treasure all belong to your majesty! May your majesty be always attentive to us, until death! The eighty-four thousand elephants, eighty-four thousand horses, eighty-four thou￾sand chariots, eighty-four thousand infantry troops, and eighty￾four thousand minor kings all belong to your majesty. 
May your majesty be always attentive to us, until death!$Then, having heard those words, King Mahāsudassana told the woman treasure:$Sister, all of you have long encouraged me into evil ways and not into the way of practicing loving-kindness. 
Sister, from now on you should all encourage me into the way of practicing loving￾kindness and not into evil ways.$Ānanda, the eighty-four thousand wives and the woman treasure stood to one side, weeping and crying with grief, and said, “We are not his majesty’s sisters, yet now he calls us sisters.”$Ānanda, those eighty-four thousand wives and the woman treasure each wiped away their tears with their clothes. 
They approached nearer to King Mahāsudassana. 
Having arrived there, they said, “Your majesty,$how should we encourage you into the way of practicing loving-kind￾ness and not into evil ways?”$King Mahāsudassana answered:$Sisters, for my sake you should say this:$Did your majesty know that a human being has a very short life span and will soon pass on to the next life?

Having with countless skillful means taught them the$Dharma, having exhorted, encouraged, and delighted them, he dismissed them and allowed them to return. 
Ānanda, understanding that King$Mahāsudassana had dismissed them, his eighty-four thousand wives and the woman treasure each paid homage to him and returned.$Ānanda, not long after his eighty-four thousand wives and the woman treasure had left, King Mahāsudassana ascended to the great palace together with his attendant.

Just as a slight affliction may arise in a householder or a householder’s son after eating marvelous food, so only a slight death pain arose in King Mahāsudassana in his last moments.$Ānanda, at that time King Mahāsudassana, having practiced the four divine abodes and having abandoned longing and desire, passed on and, after death, was reborn in a Brahmā world. 
Ānanda, do you consider King Mahāsudassana on that former occasion to be someone other [than me]? Do not think thus. 
You should know that he was me.$Ānanda, at that time I benefited myself, benefited others, and ben￾efited many people. 
I had compassion for the whole world and I sought prosperity, benefit, peace, and happiness for gods and human beings.$The teaching I gave at that time did not lead to the ultimate, was not the ultimate purity, not the ultimate holy life, not the ultimate completion of the holy life.

I have compassion for the whole world, and I seek prosperity, benefit, peace,$and happiness for gods and human beings. 
My teaching of the Dharma has now reached fulfillment, I have fulfilled my purification, fulfilled the holy life. 
Having fulfilled the holy life, I am now free from birth,$old age, sickness, death, sorrow, and distress. 
I have now attained lib￾eration from all suffering.$Ānanda, at Kusinārā, in the Sāla Grove of the Mallas at Upavattana,$by the Nerañjarā River, by the Vaggumudā River, at the Makuṭaband￾hana shrine, at the spot where a couch has been prepared for me—$within these places I will have discarded the body seven times: six$476$Division 6$times as a wheel-turning monarch, and now on the seventh [occasion]$as a Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened.$Ānanda, I see no place in this world with its gods, Māras, Brahmās,$renunciants, and brahmins, from gods to humans, where I will discard the body again. 
That is not possible [anymore], Ānanda. 
This is my final birth, my final existence, my final body, my final form, this is the end of me. 
I say: “This is the end of suffering.”$This is what the Buddha said.

Sāriputta, who can respect and support [such a] company of monks?$Thereupon, Venerable Sāriputta got up from his seat, arranged his robe so as to bare one shoulder, placed his palms together [in respect] toward the$Buddha, and said:$477^taisho518c The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$So it is, World-honored One.

^ck The Discourse on the Wheel-turning$Monarch177$Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying among the khattiya community of Mātulā, staying in a mango grove on the bank of a river. 
At that time the World-honored One told the monks:$Monks, you should be shining with the light of the Dharma178 and take the Dharma as your refuge. 
Do not be like any other light or take refuge$483^taisho520b The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$in other teachings. 
Monks, if you yourselves shine with the light of the Dharma and take the Dharma as your refuge, rather than being like other lights and taking refuge in other teachings, then you can strive in the training, obtain benefit, and acquire immeasurable merit.$Why is that? Monks, in the past there was a king named Daḷhanemi,$who was a wheel-turning monarch, intelligent and wise, equipped with a fourfold army to reign over the entire world, freely, as he liked. 
Being a righteous Dharma king he possessed seven treasures and had acquired four kinds of success. 
What were the seven treasures that he possessed and the four kinds of success that he had acquired? ...
(as described above) ...
These are the seven treasures that he possessed and the four kinds of success that he had acquired.$In the latter days of King Daḷhanemi’s reign, the divine wheel treasure suddenly slipped from its original position. 
Someone noticed this and reported it to King Daḷhanemi: “May your majesty know that the divine wheel treasure has slipped from its original position.” On hearing this, King Daḷhanemi said [to his crown prince]:$Crown prince, my divine wheel treasure has slipped from its orig￾inal position. 
Crown prince, I heard from the ancients that if a wheel-turning monarch’s divine wheel treasure slips from its orig￾inal position, that king certainly has not long to live; his life will not last much longer.$Crown prince, I have enjoyed human pleasures. 
Now I shall seek divine pleasures. 
Crown prince, I wish to shave off my hair and beard, don the yellow robe, leave home out of faith, and go forth to practice the path. 
Crown prince, I now entrust to you the four continents of the world. 
You should rule by the Dharma, not by what is against the Dharma. 
Let the country be free of evil actions and of people of impure behavior!$Later on, crown prince, if you notice that the divine wheel treasure has slipped from its original position, you should in turn entrust the country’s affairs to your crown prince and instruct him properly.

The divine wheel treasure being lost, [his son,] the duly anointed179 khattiya king, was greatly grieved, sad, and unhappy. 
Then the duly anointed khattiya king approached his father, the royal sage Daḷhanemi. 
Having arrived, he said, “May your majesty know that seven days after your majesty had gone forth to practice the path, the divine wheel treasure vanished!”$The father, the royal sage Daḷhanemi, told his son, the duly anointed khattiya king, “Do not grieve over the loss of the divine wheel treasure.$Why is that?

What are the seven treasures that he possessed and the four kinds of success that he acquired? ...
(as described above) ...
In the latter days of that wheel￾turning monarch’s reign, the divine wheel treasure suddenly slipped from its original position. 
Someone noticed that and reported it to the wheel-turning monarch, “May your majesty know that the divine wheel treasure has slipped from its original position!”$Hearing this, the wheel-turning monarch said [to his crown prince]:$Crown prince, my divine wheel treasure has slipped from its orig￾inal position. 
Crown prince, I heard from my father Daḷhanemi,$487^taisho521b The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$the royal sage, that when a wheel-turning monarch’s divine wheel treasure slips from its original position, that king certainly has not long to live; his life will not last much longer.

Then, seven days after the wheel-turning monarch had gone forth to practice the path, the divine wheel treasure vanished.$The divine wheel treasure being lost, the duly anointed khattiya king was not grieved, but was attached to sensual pleasures, insatiably avaricious, bound by desires, touched by desires, and dominated by desires. 
He did not see the danger [in them] and did not know an escape$[from them], so he ruled the country according to his own ideas. 
Because he ruled the country according to his own ideas, the country declined and no longer prospered.$In the past, as long as a wheel-turning monarch followed the trans￾mitted Dharma, the people of the country prospered and did not decline.$[This] duly anointed khattiya king, however, ruled the country according to his own ideas. 
Because he ruled the country according to his own ideas, the country declined and no longer prospered. 
Then the brahmin teachers of the country, traveling around within the national borders,$saw the people of the country declining rather than prospering, so they thought:$488^taisho521c Division 6$The duly anointed khattiya king rules the country according to his own ideas. 
Because he rules the country according to his own ideas, the people of the country are declining rather than prospering.$In the past, as long as a wheel-turning monarch followed the trans￾mitted Dharma, the people of the country prospered and did not decline. 
This duly anointed khattiya king, however, rules the coun￾try according to his own ideas. 
Because he rules the country accord￾ing to his own ideas, the people of the country are declining rather than prospering.$Then the brahmin teachers of the country went together to the duly anointed khattiya king and said:$May your majesty know that he rules the country according to his own ideas. 
Because he rules the country according to his own ideas, the people of the country are declining rather than prospering.$In the past, as long as a wheel-turning monarch followed the trans￾mitted Dharma, the people of the country prospered and did not decline. 
Now, however, your majesty rules the country according to his own ideas. 
Because he rules the country according to his own ideas, the people of the country are declining rather than pros￾pering.$Hearing this, the duly anointed khattiya king said, “Brahmins, what should I do?” The brahmin teachers of the country replied:$Your majesty, in the country there are people who are intelligent and wise, knowledgeable and calculating. 
In the country there are senior ministers and retainers who have learned the scriptures and understand them, who recite and preserve the transmitted Dharma,$[people] such as we, your retainers. 
May your majesty practice the transmitted Dharma.

What are the benefits [to be attained] in future lives?$What actions bring good rather than bad retribution?$Having heard [the answers] from them, he acted in accordance with what they had said.$However, there were poor people in the country and he did not give away property to help them. 
Because those who were poor and had no property did not get help, people became poorer. 
Because of$491$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$poverty, someone stole another’s property. 
Because he had stolen, the owner arrested and bound him and brought him before the duly anointed khattiya king, saying, “Your majesty, this man stole my property. 
May your majesty punish him!”$The duly anointed khattiya king asked that man, “Is it true that you stole?”$That man replied, “Your majesty, I did steal. 
And why? Because of poverty, your majesty. 
Without stealing I would have nothing to live on.”$Then the duly anointed khattiya king gave the thief some property and told him, “Go home, and never do it again!”$Then the people of the country heard that the duly anointed khat￾tiya king was giving away property to citizens who stole. 
Because of this, people thought: “We too should steal others’ property.” Thereupon the people of the country vied with one another to steal others’ property.$So, because those people who were poor and had no property did not get help, they became poorer; and because of poverty, theft became rife.$Owing to the growth of theft, people’s life span decreased and their physical appearance worsened. 
Monks, as their life span decreased and their physical appearance worsened, whereas a father would live for eighty thousand years, his son would live for [only] forty thousand years. 
Monks, when people’s life span was forty thousand years, some￾one stole another’s property. 
The owner arrested and bound [the thief],$and brought him before the duly anointed khattiya king, saying, “Your majesty, this man stole my property. 
May your majesty punish him!”$The duly anointed khattiya king asked that man, “Is it true that you stole?”$That man replied, “I did steal, your majesty. 
And why? Because of poverty. 
Without stealing I would have nothing to live on.”$Hearing this, the duly anointed khattiya king thought:$If I give away property to all those in my country who steal others’$property, that will exhaust the country’s treasury for nothing, and will cause theft to become rife. 
Now let me rather employ a sharp$492^taisho522b Division 6$sword. 
If someone in my country steals, I will have him arrested,$seated beneath a tall signpost, and beheaded.$So then the duly anointed khattiya king ordered that a sharp sword should be employed. 
He ordered that anyone in the country who stole should be arrested, seated beneath a tall signpost, and beheaded.$The people of the country heard that the duly anointed khattiya king had ordered that a sharp sword should be employed, and that any￾one in the country who stole should forthwith be arrested, seated beneath a tall signpost, and beheaded. 
[They thought,] “Let us rather follow his example and employ a sharp sword, using it for robbery. 
If when committing robbery we catch the owner, we will behead him.”$Thereupon, those people followed [the king’s] example and employed sharp swords, using them for robbing, catching the owners,$and beheading them. 
Because those who were poor and had no property did not get help, people became poorer. 
Because of poverty, theft became rife. 
Owing to the increase in theft, killing with swords increased. 
Owing to the increase in killing with swords, people’s life span decreased and their physical appearance worsened.$Monks, as their life span decreased and their physical appearance worsened, whereas a father lived for forty thousand years, his son lived for [only] twenty thousand years. 
Monks, when people’s life span was twenty thousand years, someone stole another’s property. 
The owner arrested and bound [the thief], and brought him before the duly anointed khattiya king, saying, “Your majesty, this man stole my property. 
May your majesty punish him!”$The duly anointed khattiya king asked that man, “Is it true that you stole?”$Then the thief thought:$If the duly anointed khattiya king knew the facts, he would have me bound and whipped, or have me cast out or exiled, or have my money and property confiscated, or have various painful punish￾ments inflicted on me, impaling me or beheading me. 
Let me rather deceive the duly anointed khattiya king with false speech.$493^taisho522c The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Thinking thus, he said, “Your majesty, I did not steal.”$Because those who were poor and had no property did not get help, people became poorer. 
Because of poverty, theft became rife.$Owing to the increase of theft, killing with swords increased. 
Owing to the increase in killing with swords, false speech and divisive speech increased. 
Owing to the increase in false speech and divisive speech,$people’s life span decreased and their physical appearance worsened.$Monks, as their life span decreased and their physical appearance worsened, whereas a father would live for twenty thousand years, his son would live for [only] ten thousand years. 
Monks, when people’s life span was ten thousand years, some were virtuous and others were not virtuous. 
Those who were not virtuous, being envious of those who were virtuous, committed adultery with the wives [of the virtuous ones].$Because those who were poor and had no property did not get help, people became poorer. 
Because of poverty, theft became rife.$Owing to the increase in theft, killing with swords increased. 
Owing to the increase in killing with swords, false speech and divisive speech increased. 
Owing to the increase in false speech and divisive speech,$envy and sexual misconduct increased. 
Owing to the increase in envy and sexual misconduct, those people’s life span decreased and their physical appearance worsened.$Monks, as their life span decreased and their physical appearance worsened, whereas a father would live for ten thousand years, his son would live for [only] five thousand years. 
Monks, when people’s life span was five thousand years, three kinds of behavior increased: unlaw￾ful desires, disagreeable covetousness, and wrong teachings.$180 Owing to the increase of these three kinds of behavior, people’s life span decreased and their physical appearance worsened. 
Monks, as their life span decreased and their physical appearance worsened, whereas a father would live for five thousand years, his son would live for [only]$two thousand five hundred years.$Monks, when people’s life span was two thousand five hundred years, another three conditions increased: divisive speech, harsh speech, and frivolous speech. 
Owing to the increase of these three conditions, those people’s life span decreased and their physical$494^taisho523a Division 6$appearance worsened. 
Monks, as their life span decreased and their physical appearance worsened, whereas a father would live for two thousand five hundred years, his son would live for [only] one thousand years. 
Monks, when people’s life span was one thousand years, one condition increased, namely wrong view. 
Owing to the increase in$[this] one condition, those people’s life span decreased and their physical appearance worsened.$Monks, as their life span decreased and their physical appearance worsened, whereas a father would live for one thousand years, his son would live for [only] five hundred years.$Monks, when people’s life span was five hundred years, those people were not filial to their parents throughout their lives and could not respect renunciants and brahmins. 
They did not serve them obedi￾ently, did not perform meritorious actions, and did not see that retri￾bution for faults comes in future lives.$Because they were not filial to their parents throughout their lives and could not respect renunciants and brahmins, [because they] did not serve them obediently, did not perform meritorious actions, and did not see that retribution for faults comes in future lives— conse￾quently, monks, whereas a father would live for five hundred years,$his son would live for either two hundred and fifty years or two hundred years. 
Nowadays, monks, someone who enjoys longevity may live one hundred years or not much more.$The Buddha said further:$Monks, in the distant future, people’s life span will be ten years. 
Monks,$when people’s life span is ten years, girls will get married as soon as they reach the age of five months.$Monks, when people’s life span is ten years, a kind of grain called barnyard millet will become the preferred food, just as white rice is the preferred food at present. 
Thus, monks, when people’s life span is ten years, the kind of grain called barnyard millet will become the preferred food. 
Monks, when people’s life span is ten years, today’s preferred foods—ghee, salt, honey, sugarcane, sugar—will all dis￾appear.$495$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Monks, when people’s life span is ten years, those who follow the ten unwholesome courses of action will be respected by others. 
Just as those who follow the ten wholesome courses of action are respected by others today, so monks, when people’s life span is ten years, those who follow the ten unwholesome courses of action will be respected by others. 
Monks, when people’s life span is ten years, there will be no such word as “wholesome,” let alone people who follow the ten wholesome courses of action.$Monks, when people’s life span is ten years, someone called “the$Punisher” will travel around, going everywhere, from house to house,$inflicting punishment. 
Monks, when people’s life span is ten years,$mothers will have strong thoughts of cruelty toward their children.$Children will also have strong thoughts of cruelty toward their mothers.$Fathers, children, brothers, sisters, and [other] relatives will gradually turn against one another, and have thoughts of cruelty toward one another.$Monks, just as a hunter has strong thoughts of cruelty on seeing a deer, so when people’s life span is ten years, mothers will have strong thoughts of cruelty toward their children. 
Children will also have strong thoughts of cruelty toward their mothers. 
Fathers, children, brothers,$sisters, and [other] relatives will gradually turn against one another,$and have thoughts of cruelty toward one another.$Monks, when people’s life span is ten years, there will be a mas￾sacre by sword lasting seven days. 
[During this period,] if one grasps a piece of grass, it will be transformed into a sword, and if one grasps a piece of firewood, it will also be transformed into a sword, and people will use these swords to kill one another.$At the end of the seven-day sword massacre, they will stop. 
During that period there will also be some people who give rise to shame and scruples, who detest and dislike hostility. 
During the seven-day sword massacre, these [people] will go into the mountains or into the wilder￾ness and hide in secret places. 
At the end of the seven days, they will come out of the secret places in the mountains or the wilderness and,$on meeting one another again, will give rise to a mind of kindness and compassion, and have strong thoughts of mutual affection.$496^taisho523b Division 6$It is just as when a loving mother’s only son returns home safely from afar after a long absence, and on seeing each other again they rejoice, and give rise to a mind of kindness and compassion, with strong thoughts of mutual affection. 
In the same way, at the end of the seven days, those people will come out of the secret places in the mountains or in the wilderness and, on meeting one another again, will give rise to a mind of kindness and compassion, with strong thoughts of mutual affection.$Having met together, they will say:$Friends, now we see each other [again]; now we have attained safety.

^ck The Discourse to Pāyāsi181$Thus have I heard: At one time Venerable Kumāra Kassapa was staying in the country of Kosala. 
Together with a large company of monks he approached$Setavyā, and stayed to the north of the village in a rosewood grove.$At that time in Setavyā there was a king named Pāyāsi, who was extremely rich, possessing limitless wealth and countless livestock and prop￾erty, endowed with various feudatories and manors. 
The manors, springs,$ponds, grass, and trees in Setavyā all belonged to the king, having been given to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala.$Then the brahmins and householders in Setavyā heard this:$A renunciant named Kumāra Kassapa is dwelling in the country of$Kosala together with a large company of monks; he has arrived in$Setavyā and is staying to the north of the village in the Rosewood$Grove. 
The renunciant Kumāra Kassapa has a great reputation, is well known in all the ten directions.$[Thus they thought:]$Kumāra Kassapa has unhindered eloquence and what he says is subtle.$He is a learned arahant. 
Those who visit this arahant, pay respect to him, and serve him respectfully quickly gain good benefits. 
Let us go and see the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa!$[So] the people of Setavyā, walking in groups, brahmins with brahmins,$householders with householders, went together out of Setavyā toward the north, heading for the Rosewood Grove.$505^taisho525a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$At that time King Pāyāsi, who was in his main hall, saw in the distance the people of Setavyā, walking in groups, brahmins with brahmins, house￾holders with householders, going together out of Setavyā toward the north,$heading for the Rosewood Grove. 
Seeing this, King Pāyāsi said to an atten￾dant:$Why are the people of Setavyā, walking in groups, brahmins with brah￾mins, householders with householders, going together out of Setavyā$today toward the north, heading for the Rosewood Grove?$The attendant said:$Your majesty, those brahmins and householders in Setavyā have heard this:$A renunciant named Kumāra Kassapa is dwelling in the country of Kosala together with a large company of monks; he has arrived in Setavyā and is staying to the north of the village in the Rosewood$Grove.$Your majesty, the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa has a great reputation,$being well known widely in the ten directions. 
[Thus they thought]:$Kumāra Kassapa has unhindered eloquence and what he says is subtle. 
He is a learned arahant. 
If one sees this arahant, pays respect to him and serves him respectfully, one will quickly gain good benefits. 
Let us go and see the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa!$For this reason, your majesty, the people of Setavyā, walking in groups,$brahmins with brahmins, householders with householders, are going together out of Setavyā toward the north, heading for the Rosewood$Grove.$Hearing this, King Pāyāsi told the attendant:$Go to the brahmins and householders of Setavyā and tell them: King$Pāyāsi tells the brahmins and householders of Setavyā:$Please wait, friends. 
Let me go with you to see the renunciant$Kumāra Kassapa. 
You are foolish. 
Do not be deceived by him$506^taisho525b Division 6$[into believing that] there are future lives, [that] beings are reborn.$I hold this view, this tenet: “There are no future lives; beings are not reborn.”$Following the king’s instructions, the attendant approached the brahmins and householders of Setavyā and said to them:$King Pāyāsi tells the brahmins and householders of Setavyā:$Please wait, friends. 
Let me go with you to see the renunciant$Kumāra Kassapa. 
You are foolish. 
Do not be deceived by him [into believing that] there are future lives, that beings are reborn. 
I hold this view, this tenet: “There are no future lives; beings are not reborn.”$Having heard this message, the brahmins and householders of Setavyā$replied to the attendant: “We shall wait as commanded.”$The attendant returned and reported: “I have delivered your command.$182$The brahmins and householders of Setavyā await your majesty. 
May your majesty know the right time.”$Then King Pāyāsi commanded a charioteer: “Prepare a chariot imme￾diately. 
I wish to go now.”$Following the king’s instruction, the charioteer immediately prepared a chariot and returned to tell the king: “The chariot is ready. 
It is at your majesty’s disposal.”$Then King Pāyāsi boarded the chariot and departed. 
Approaching the brahmins and householders of Setavyā, he went with them to the Rosewood$Grove. 
Then, on seeing in the distance the venerable Kumāra Kassapa among the trees in the grove, King Pāyāsi alighted from the chariot and proceeded on foot toward the venerable Kumāra Kassapa.$After having exchanged greetings with Venerable Kumāra Kassapa, he sat down to one side and asked: “Kassapa, I now want to ask a question.$Would you listen?”$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said, “Pāyāsi, ask what you will. 
Having heard it, I will consider it.”$So King Pāyāsi asked:$507^taisho525c The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Kassapa, I hold this view, this tenet: “There are no future lives; beings are not reborn.” Renunciant Kumāra Kassapa, what do you think [of this]?$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:$Pāyāsi, I will now question you, king. 
Please reply as you see fit. 
What do you think, king? The present sun and moon, are they [only] in this life or [also in] future lives?$Pāyāsi replied, “Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says, still$I hold this view, this tenet: ‘There are no future lives; beings are not reborn.’”$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said, “Pāyāsi, have you another counter￾argument beyond this?”$Pāyāsi replied:$Yes, Kassapa, I have another counterargument.$183 Kassapa, [once] some of my relatives were critically ill, so I went to their place. 
Having arrived there, I said:$You should know that I hold this view, this tenet: “There are no future lives; beings are not reborn.” [But], relatives, some renun￾ciants and brahmins hold this view, this tenet: “There are future lives; beings are reborn.” I have always disbelieved what they say.$They say further: “If men or women perform evil deeds, if they are indolent, idle, negligent, jealous, stingy, greedy, closefisted,$not virtuous, and strongly attached to property, then owing to these causes and conditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death,$they will certainly go to a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell.”$[Let us] suppose that what those renunciants and brahmins say is true. 
You, my relatives, have performed evil deeds, you have been indolent, idle, negligent, jealous, stingy, greedy, closefisted,$not virtuous, and strongly attached to property.$If, at the breaking up of the body, after death, you do [indeed]$have to go to a bad realm of existence and are reborn in hell, then come back and tell me: “Pāyāsi, in hell the torments are thus and thus.” If that happens, then I will see it in the present.$508$Division 6$They heard what I said, they received my instructions, yet none of them has come to tell me: “Pāyāsi, in hell the torments are thus and thus.” For this reason, Kassapa, I think: “There are no future lives;$beings are not reborn.”$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:$Pāyāsi, I will question you again. 
Please reply as you see fit. 
Suppose the king’s men arrest a criminal and bring him before the king, saying,$“Your majesty, this man has committed a crime. 
The king should punish him.” The king tells them:$Take him away. 
Bind his hands behind him and set him on a donkey.$Beat a broken drum that makes a sound like a donkey’s braying.$Having announced the sentence widely, lead him out through the southern gate, seat him beneath a tall signpost, and behead him.$Following his instructions, the king’s men bind the criminal’s hands behind him and set him on a donkey. 
They beat a broken drum that makes a sound like a donkey’s braying. 
Having announced the sentence widely, they lead him out through the southern gate, seat him beneath a tall signpost, and are about to behead him. 
This man, on the point of death, says to the executioner, “Please wait a while. 
I wish to see my parents, wife and children, my male and female servants and messen￾gers. 
Let me go temporarily.”$What do you think, king? Would the executioner release the criminal and let him go temporarily?$Pāyāsi replied, “No, Kassapa.”$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:$Pāyāsi, such is also the case with your relatives who had performed evil deeds, who had been indolent, idle, negligent, jealous, stingy,$greedy, closefisted, not virtuous, and strongly attached to property, and who, owing to these causes and conditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, certainly went to a bad realm of existence and were reborn in hell.$509^taisho526a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$When the wardens of hell caught them and tortured them, [suppose that] they told the wardens of hell:$Wardens of hell, please wait a while and stop torturing me.

Would the wardens of hell release your rel￾atives and let them come [back] temporarily?$Pāyāsi replied, “No, Kassapa.”$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:$Pāyāsi, you should contemplate future lives in this way, since you cannot see them with your physical eyes.$Pāyāsi, if a renunciant or a brahmin cuts off and abandons desire,$inclines toward abandoning desire; if he cuts off and abandons hatred,$inclines towards abandoning hatred; if he cuts off and abandons delu￾sion, inclines towards abandoning delusion—then with the purified divine eye, which surpasses human [vision], he sees beings as they die and are reborn handsome or ugly, excellent or not excellent, as they depart and return to good or bad realms of existence in accordance with their [previous] deeds. 
He sees this as it really is.$King Pāyāsi again said, “Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says, I still hold this view, this tenet: ‘There are no future lives; beings are not reborn.’”$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said: “Pāyāsi, have you another counter￾argument beyond this?”$Pāyāsi replied:$Yes, Kassapa, I have another counterargument.

The wise, on hearing a parable,$understand its implication. 
Suppose, Pāyāsi, that outside a village or a town there is a cesspit full of feces, so deep that a man could be sub￾merged in it up to his head. 
A man has fallen into this cesspit and sunk to the bottom. 
Suppose that another man, pitying him, seeking his pros￾perity, benefit, peace, and happiness, pulls him gently from the cesspit,$wipes him down with a slice of bamboo, brushes him with leaves, and bathes him with warm water.$511$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Later on, after [the first man] has been cleaned and bathed, perfume is applied to his body. 
He ascends to the main hall, and is entertained with the pleasures of the five senses. 
What do you think, king? Would that man enjoy recalling that cesspit, delight in praising it, and wish to revisit it?$Pāyāsi replied:$No, Kassapa. 
If someone else were to recall that cesspit [to him], delight in praising it, and wish [him] to revisit it, then he would not love this person. 
How much less would he himself recall that cesspit, delight in praising it, and wish to see it again! This is not possible.$[Venerable Kumāra Kassapa continued:]$Pāyāsi, if your relatives performed good deeds, if they were energetic,$diligent, not negligent, not jealous, not stingy or greedy, openhanded,$virtuous; if they generously renounced [their wealth] and gave it to orphans and the poor, always enjoyed practicing charity, and were not attached to property—then owing to these causes and conditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they certainly ascended to a good realm of existence, were reborn in a heavenly realm.$Having been reborn in heaven, they would entertain themselves with the heavenly pleasures of the five senses. 
What do you think,$king? Would those gods in heaven give up the heavenly pleasures of the five senses and, recalling the pleasures of the five senses in this human realm, delight in praising them, and wish to revisit them?$Pāyāsi replied:$No, Kassapa. 
Why is that? The pleasures of the five senses of this human realm are putrid, unclean, utterly abhorrent, unattractive, unde￾sirable, coarse, and impure. 
Kassapa, compared with the pleasures of the five senses in this human realm, heavenly sensual pleasures are the utmost, the supreme, the best, the most wonderful and excellent. 
It cannot be that a god in heaven would give up the heavenly pleasures of the five senses, recall the pleasures of the five senses in this human realm, delight in praising them, and wish to see them again.$512^taisho526c Division 6$[Venerable Kumāra Kassapa continued:]$Pāyāsi, you should contemplate future lives in this way, since you cannot see them with your physical eyes. 
Pāyāsi, if a renunciant or a brahmin cuts off and abandons desire, inclines toward abandoning desire; if he cuts off and abandons hatred, inclines toward abandoning hatred; if he cuts off and abandons delusion, inclines toward abandoning delusion—then with the purified divine eye, which surpasses human$[vision], he sees beings as they die and are reborn handsome or ugly,$excellent or not excellent, as they depart and return to good or bad realms of existence in accordance with their [previous] deeds.

What is a hundred years for human beings is one day and night for the thirty-three gods. 
Thirty such days and nights make a month, twelve such months make a year, and a thousand such years are the heavenly life span of the thirty-three gods. 
What do you think, king?$If your relatives performed good deeds, if they were energetic,$diligent, not negligent, not jealous, not stingy, not greedy, openhanded,$virtuous; if they generously renounced [their wealth] and gave it to orphans and the poor, always enjoyed practicing charity, and were not attached to property—then owing to these causes and conditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they certainly ascended to a good realm of existence, were reborn in a heavenly realm.$Having been reborn in heaven, they might think:$We should first entertain ourselves with the heavenly pleasures of the five senses for one day and night, or entertain ourselves with$514^taisho527a Division 6$the heavenly pleasures of the five senses for two, three, four, or even six or seven days. 
After that we shall go to tell King Pāyāsi that the pleasures in heaven are thus and thus.$What do you think, king?

There are no long or short objects, nor is there seeing of long or short objects. 
There are no near or far objects,$nor is there seeing of near or far objects. 
There are no rough or smooth objects, nor is there seeing of rough or smooth objects.$Why? There are no objects because from the beginning I have never seen or known them.$[If] the blind man spoke like this, would it be true?$Pāyāsi replied:$No, Kassapa. 
Why is that? Kassapa, there are black and white objects,$and also there is seeing of black and white objects. 
There are long and short objects, and also there is seeing of long and short objects. 
There are near and far objects, and also there is seeing of near and far objects.$There are rough and smooth objects, and also there is seeing of rough and smooth objects. 
If the blind man were to say “There are no objects$515^taisho527b The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$because from the beginning I have never seen or known them,” then what he said would not be true.$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:$King Pāyāsi, you are also like a blind man if you say:$Kassapa, who has come back from his afterlife to tell you: “Renun￾ciant Kumāra Kassapa, the life span in heaven is long, while the life span in the human realm is short.

Why is that?$Renunciant Kumāra Kassapa, you go so far as to compare me to a blind man. 
Kassapa, assuming it was known to me or known to my relatives who performed good deeds, who were energetic, diligent, not negligent, not jealous, not stingy, not greedy, openhanded, virtuous;$who generously renounced [their wealth] and gave it to orphans and the poor, always enjoyed practicing charity, and were not attached to property, that owing to these causes and conditions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they certainly would ascend to a good realm of existence, and be reborn in heaven—then, Kassapa, I would now practice charity, perform meritorious actions, observe the uposatha and the precepts, and then commit suicide by using a knife, or taking poison, or throwing [myself] into a hole or a well, or hanging myself.$Renunciant Kumāra Kassapa, you should not go so far as to compare me to that blind man.$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:$Pāyāsi, listen while I tell you another parable. 
The wise, on hearing a parable, understand its implication.$516$Division 6$Suppose, Pāyāsi, that a brahmin has a young wife who has just become pregnant, and that he already has a son by his former wife;$and then in the midst of this that brahmin suddenly dies.$After his death, the former wife’s son says to his stepmother, “Step￾mother, you should know that all the property of this household should now belong to me. 
I see no one else anymore who should share in it.”$The stepmother replies, “I am pregnant now. 
If I give birth to a boy,$you should share with him. 
If I give birth to a girl, all the property belongs to you.”$The former wife’s son says to his stepmother a second and a third time, “All the property of this household should now belong to me.

If I give birth to a boy, you should share with him. 
If I give birth to a girl, all the property belongs to you.”$Then the stepmother, being foolish, ignorant, of poor understanding,$lacking wisdom, [though] desiring to protect her life, on the contrary harms herself. 
She enters an inner room, takes a sharp knife and cuts open her belly, to see whether it is a boy or a girl. 
Being foolish, igno￾rant, of poor understanding, lacking wisdom, [though] desiring to protect her life, she on the contrary harms herself and the child in her belly.$It should be known that Pāyāsi is likewise foolish, ignorant, of poor understanding, lacking wisdom, in that [though] desiring to protect his life, he on the contrary thinks like this:$Kassapa, if it were known to me or known to my relatives who performed good deeds, who were energetic, diligent, not negligent,$not jealous, not stingy, not greedy, openhanded, virtuous; who generously renounced [their wealth] and gave it to orphans and the poor, always enjoyed practicing charity, and were not attached to property, that owing to these causes and conditions, at the break￾ing up of the body, after death, they certainly would ascend to a good realm of existence, and be reborn in heaven—then, Kassapa,$I would now practice charity, perform meritorious actions, observe$517^taisho527c The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$the uposatha and the precepts, and then commit suicide by using a knife, or taking poison, or throwing [myself] into a hole or a well, or hanging myself.$[And Pāyāsi also says:] “Renunciant Kumāra Kassapa, you should not go so far as to compare me to that blind man.”$Pāyāsi, if an energetic man lives long, he will acquire great merit.$If he acquires great merit, he will be reborn in heaven and enjoy longevity. 
Pāyāsi, you should contemplate future lives thus, [since you]$cannot see them with your physical eyes:$Pāyāsi, if a renunciant or a brahmin cuts off and abandons desire,$inclines toward abandoning desire; if he cuts off and abandons hatred,$inclines toward abandoning hatred; if he cuts off and abandons delusion,$inclines toward abandoning delusion—then with the purified divine eye, which surpasses human [vision], he sees beings as they die and are reborn handsome or ugly, excellent or not excellent, as they depart and return to good or bad realms of existence in accordance with their$[previous] deeds. 
He sees this as it really is.$King Pāyāsi again said, “Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says, I still hold this view, this tenet: ‘There are no future lives; beings are not reborn.’”$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said, “Pāyāsi, have you another counterar￾gument beyond this?”$Pāyāsi replied:$Yes, Kassapa, I have another counterargument. 
Kassapa, [once] some of my relatives were critically ill. 
I went to their place to visit and greet them, and they also visited and greeted me. 
When they died, I visited and greeted them again, but they did not visit and greet me again; so$I also do not visit and greet them. 
Kassapa, for this reason I think,$“Beings are not reborn.”$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:$Pāyāsi, listen while I tell you another parable. 
The wise, on hearing a parable, understand its implication.$518^taisho528a Division 6$Suppose, Pāyāsi, there is a skilled conch-blower. 
He goes to a place where nobody has ever heard the sound of a conch. 
He mounts a high hill on a dark night, and with all his might he blows the conch.$Because the people there have never heard the sound of a conch, on hearing it, they think, “What is this sound that is so wonderful, very extraordinary, truly delightful, pleasant to the ear, and gladdening to the heart?”$Then that crowd together approaches the skilled conch-blower.$Having arrived, they ask: “What is this sound that is so wonderful,$very extraordinary, truly delightful, pleasant to the ear, and gladdening to the heart?”$The skilled conch-blower puts the conch down on the ground and tells the crowd: “Sirs, you should know that it is the sound of this conch.”$Thereupon, the people kick the conch, saying, “Make a sound,$conch! Make a sound, conch!” But it is silent, producing no sound.$The skilled conch-blower thinks:$Now, these people are foolish, ignorant, poor in understanding,$lacking wisdom. 
Why so? They seek to get sound from a senseless object.$Then the skilled conch-blower takes the conch, washes it with water,$raises it to his mouth, and blows it with all his might. 
Hearing it, the people in the crowd think:$The conch is marvelous! Why so? Because by means of hands,$water, and the blowing of wind from the mouth it produces a fine sound that pervades the four directions.$In the same way, Pāyāsi, if a man is still alive, he can talk with and greet others. 
[But] when he is dead, he can no longer talk with or greet others.$Pāyāsi, you should contemplate the rebirth of beings thus, [since you] cannot see it with your physical eyes. 
Pāyāsi, if a renunciant or a brahmin cuts off and abandons desire, inclines toward abandoning desire; if he cuts off and abandons hatred, inclines toward abandoning$519$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$hatred; if he cuts off and abandons delusion, inclines toward abandoning delusion—then with the purified divine eye, which surpasses human$[vision], he sees beings as they die and are reborn handsome or ugly,$excellent or not excellent, as they depart and return to good or bad realms of existence in accordance with their [previous] deeds. 
He sees this as it really is.$King Pāyāsi again said, “Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says, I still hold this view, this tenet: ‘Beings are not reborn.’”$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said, “Pāyāsi, have you another counterar￾gument beyond this?”$Pāyāsi replied:$Yes, Kassapa, I have another counterargument. 
Kassapa, [once] my officers arrested a criminal and brought him before me. 
Having arrived,$they said, “Your majesty, this man has committed a crime. 
May your majesty punish him!” I told them:$Take this criminal away and weigh him on the scales alive. 
After having weighed him alive, put him down on the ground and stran￾gle him with a rope. 
Having killed him, weigh him again. 
I want to know when this man is light, soft, and has a lustrous appearance:$when he is dead or when he is alive.$Following my instructions, they took this criminal away and weighed him on the scales alive. 
Having done so, they put him down on the ground and strangled him with a rope. 
Having killed him, they weighed him again. 
When the criminal was alive, he was very light and soft,$with lustrous appearance. 
When dead, his skin became thick and he became heavy, stiff, not soft, and lost his lustrous appearance. 
For this reason, Kassapa, I think, “Beings are not reborn.”$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:$Pāyāsi, listen while I tell you another parable. 
The wise, on hearing a parable, understand its implication.$Suppose, Pāyāsi, that an iron ball or an iron ploughshare has been heated by fire all day. 
At that time, it is very light and soft, with$520^taisho528b Division 6$a lustrous appearance. 
[But] once the fire is extinguished, it gradually cools down, becomes solid, thick, and heavy, and becomes stiff, not soft, and loses its lustrous appearance.$In the same way, Pāyāsi, if a man is alive, his body is very light and soft, with lustrous appearance. 
[But] once he is dead, he becomes thick, heavy, stiff, not soft, and loses his lustrous appearance.$Pāyāsi, you should contemplate the rebirth of beings thus, [since you] cannot see it with your physical eyes.

Having arrived, they said, “Your majesty, this man has com￾mitted a crime. 
May your majesty punish him!” I told them:$Take this criminal and put him head downward into an iron caul￾dron or a copper cauldron. 
Seal its mouth and light a fire underneath it. 
Having lit the fire, watch to see [if any] being enters or leaves,$comes or goes, or moves around.$Following my instructions, they took this criminal away and put him head downward into an iron cauldron or a copper cauldron. 
They sealed its mouth and lit a fire underneath it. 
Having lit the fire, they watched to see [if any] being entered or left, came or went, or moved around.$521^taisho528c The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Kassapa, by such means I saw no rebirth of any being. 
For this reason,$Kassapa, I think: “Beings are not reborn.”$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:$Pāyāsi, I will question you now. 
Please reply as you see fit. 
What do you think? Do you recall that, while taking the noontide rest on your bed [after having] eaten excellent, delicious food, you saw in a dream pleasure parks, bathing pools, groves, flowers, fruits, clear springs,$and long streams, and saw yourself taking recreation there, moving around, coming and going to your heart’s content?$Pāyāsi replied, “Yes, I do recall so.”$Kassapa asked further, “While you were taking the noontide rest on your bed [after having] eaten excellent, delicious food, were any attendants present?”$He replied, “Yes.”$Kassapa asked further:$While you were taking the noontide rest on your bed [after having]$eaten excellent, delicious food, at that time did the attendants to [your]$left and right see you entering or leaving, moving around, or coming and going?$Pāyāsi replied, “How could even the most remarkable individual see this, let alone the attendants to [my] left and right?”$[Kassapa said:]$Pāyāsi, you should contemplate the rebirth of beings thus, [since you]$cannot see it with your physical eyes. 
Pāyāsi, if a renunciant or a brah￾min cuts off and abandons desire, inclines toward abandoning desire;$if he cuts off and abandons hatred, inclines toward abandoning hatred;$if he cuts off and abandons delusion, inclines toward abandoning delu￾sion—then with the purified divine eye, which surpasses human [vision],$he sees beings as they die and are reborn handsome or ugly, excellent or not excellent, as they depart and return to good or bad realms of existence in accordance with their [previous] deeds. 
He sees this as it really is.$522$Division 6$King Pāyāsi again said, “Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says, I still hold this view, this tenet: ‘Beings are not reborn.’”$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said, “Pāyāsi, have you another counterar￾gument beyond this?”$Pāyāsi replied:$Yes, Kassapa, I have another counterargument. 
Kassapa, [once] my officers arrested a criminal and brought him before me. 
Having arrived,$they said, “Your majesty, this man has committed a crime. 
May your majesty punish him!” I told them:$Take this criminal away. 
Peel off his skin and tear off his flesh.$Cut off his sinews and break his bones to the marrow. 
Search for the being to be reborn.$Following my instructions, they took this criminal away, peeled off his skin, tore off his flesh, cut off hissinews, and broke his bonesto the mar￾row, searching for the being to be reborn. 
Kassapa, I used such means to search for the being to be reborn, but in the end I could notsee any being to be reborn. 
For this reason, Kassapa, I think: “Beings are not reborn.”$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:$Pāyāsi, listen while I tell you another parable. 
The wise, on hearing a parable, understand its implication.$Suppose, Pāyāsi, that a fire-worshiping matted-hair brahmin isliving near a road. 
Some merchants stay the night at a place not far away from him. 
Then, when the night has passed and dawn has broken, the merchants set out hastily, forgetfully leaving behind a small child.$Then the fire-worshiping matted-hair brahmin, having risen early,$looks around the place where the merchants stayed and sees the small child left alone without an owner. 
Seeing it, he thinks, “This small child has nobody to depend on. 
He will definitely die unless I support him.” So he carries the small child away, returns to his own place, and rears him. 
The small child grows up, endowed with all his faculties.$Then the fire-worshiping matted-hair brahmin has some small matter for which he has to go among the people. 
The fire-worshiping matted-hair brahmin therefore instructs the boy:$523^taisho529a The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$I have some small matter for which I have to go among the people for a while. 
You must feed the fire and be careful not to let it go out. 
If it should go out, use these fire-sticks to make fire.$Then, having instructed him well, the fire-worshiping matted-hair brah￾min goes among the people.$Later on the boy goes out to play, and the fire goes out. 
When he returns he tries to make fire. 
He takes the fire-sticks and hits them on the ground, saying, “Come out, fire! Come out, fire!” But no fire comes out. 
He exerts more effort, hitting it on a stone, [saying,] “Come out,$fire! Come out, fire!” But still no fire comes out. 
As no fire comes out,$he breaks the fire-sticks into ten and even a hundred pieces, throws them away, and sits down on the ground, anxiously saying, “I cannot get fire. 
What should I do?”$Then the fire-worshiping matted-hair brahmin, having finished what he had to do among the people, returns to his own place. 
Having arrived, he asks, “Boy, did you look after the fire without playing and not let it go out?”$The boy said:$Venerable sir, I went out to play, and the fire went out. 
When I$returned, I tried to make fire. 
I took the fire-sticks and hit them on the ground, saying: “Come out, fire! Come out, fire!” But no fire came out. 
I exerted more effort, hitting them on a stone, [saying,]$“Come out, fire! Come out, fire!” But still no fire came out. 
As no fire came out, I broke the fire-sticks into ten and even a hundred pieces, threw them away and sat down on the ground. 
Venerable sir, I tried like this, but could not get fire. 
What should I have done?$Then the fire-worshiping matted-hair brahmin thinks:$This boy is foolish, ignorant, poor in understanding, and lacking wisdom. 
Why so? How else could one implore the non-intelligent fire-sticks [with words] to render fire?$The fire-worshiping matted-hair brahmin then takes dry sticks to use as the upper and lower fire-sticks, places them on the ground and, by$524^taisho529b Division 6$rubbing, causes [sparks of] fire to come out, which gradually become flames. 
He tells the boy:$Boy, this is how one should make fire. 
One should not be like you,$foolish, ignorant, poor in understanding, lacking wisdom, and try to implore the non-intelligent fire-sticks to render fire.$Pāyāsi, it should be known that you are likewise foolish, ignorant, poor in understanding, and lacking wisdom, searching in dead flesh and even in marrow for a being to be reborn.$Pāyāsi, you should contemplate the rebirth of beings thus, [since you] cannot see it with your physical eyes. 
Pāyāsi, if a renunciant or a brahmin cuts off and abandons desire, inclines toward abandoning desire; if he cuts off and abandons hatred, inclines toward abandoning hatred; if he cuts off and abandons delusion, inclines toward abandoning delusion—then with the purified divine eye, which surpasses human$[vision], he sees beings as they die and are reborn handsome or ugly,$excellent or not excellent, as they depart and return to good or bad realms of existence in accordance with their [previous] deeds. 
He sees this as it really is.$King Pāyāsi again said:$Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says, I still hold on to this view, out of desire, aversion, fear, and delusion; I am utterly unable to let go of it. 
Why is that?$If other people in other countries heard of this, they would say,$“King Pāyāsi held his view for a long time, but he has been refuted,$defeated, and made to abandon it by the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa.”$For this reason, Kassapa, I hold on to this view, out of desire, aversion,$fear, and delusion; I am utterly unable to let go of it.$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:$Pāyāsi, listen while I tell you a parable. 
The wise, on hearing a parable,$understand its implication.$Suppose, Pāyāsi, two friends leave home to make a living. 
On$525$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$their way, they first see a large amount of hemp without an owner. 
On seeing it, one of the men tells his companion:$You should know that there is a large amount of hemp here without an owner. 
Let us take it, make up a heavy load for each of us, and carry it back home as our source of livelihood.$So they carry off their heavy load. 
Further on, they see a large amount of cotton thread and cotton clothes without an owner. 
Further on again,$they see a large amount of silver without an owner. 
On seeing it, one of them lays down his load of hemp, takes the silver, and loads himself up with it. 
Still further on they see a large amount of gold without an owner.$Then the man loaded with silver tells the one loaded with hemp:$Now, you should know that there is a great amount of gold here without an owner. 
You discard your hemp and I will discard my silver. 
I want you and me to take this gold and carry a heavy load of it home, as our source of livelihood.$The man loaded with hemp tells the one loaded with silver:$My load of hemp is fine. 
It is well packed and tied up, and I have carried it a long way. 
I cannot let go of it. 
You know what is fit for you. 
Don’t worry about me!$At this the man loaded with silver grabs the load of hemp by force and throws it to the ground, damaging it. 
The one with the hemp tells the one with the silver:$You have damaged my load. 
My load of hemp is well tied up, and$I have carried it a long way. 
I want to carry this hemp back home myself. 
I will never let go of it. 
You know what is fit for you. 
Don’t worry about me!$Then the man with the load of silver discards it, loads himself up heavily with gold, and heads back home. 
As this man loaded with gold approaches his home, his father and mother, seeing him in the distance coming back with a load of gold, exclaim:$526^taisho529c Division 6$Welcome, good son! Come quickly, good son! Thanks to this gold,$you will make a good living, support your father and mother, and sustain your wife, children, your male and female servants, and messengers. 
Furthermore, you can make offerings to renunciants and brahmins, make merit and uplift [yourself], [experience] good fruits and good results, being reborn in heaven and enjoying longevity.$[But when] the man loaded with hemp returns to his home, his father and mother, seeing him in the distance coming back with a load of hemp, reprove him saying:$Here you come, criminal! Here you come, man without virtue!$With this hemp you will not make a living, or support your father and mother, or sustain your wife, children, male and female ser￾vants, and messengers. 
Neither can you make offerings to renun￾ciants and brahmins, make merit and uplift [yourself], [experience]$good fruits and good results, or be reborn in heaven and enjoy longevity.$Pāyāsi, you should know that such is also the case with you. 
If you hold on to this view out of desire, aversion, fear, and delusion, and do not let go of it, you will be subject to immeasurable misfortune and be abhorred by many people.$King Pāyāsi again said:$Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says, I still hold on to this view, out of desire, aversion, fear, and delusion; I am utterly unable to let go of it. 
Why is that? If other people in other countries heard of this,$they would say, “King Pāyāsi held his view for a long time, but he has been refuted, defeated, and made to abandon it by the renunciant Kumāra$Kassapa.” For this reason, Kassapa, I hold on to this view, out of desire,$aversion, fear, and delusion; I am utterly unable to let go of it.$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:$Pāyāsi, listen while I tell you another parable. 
The wise, on hearing a parable, understand its implication.$527$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Suppose, Pāyāsi, some merchants and a crowd of associates, with a thousand carts, are traveling on a road [through an area] of scarce provisions. 
The crowd has two leaders. 
They think: “How can we get out of this trouble?” They think further: “This crowd should be divided into two groups of five hundred carts each.” So those merchants divide into two groups of five hundred carts each.$Then one leader of the merchants leads five hundred carts along the road [through the area] of scarce provisions. 
That merchant leader often goes ahead [by himself]. 
He sees a man coming from a side road with his clothes all wet, with dark body, yellow head, and two deep red eyes, wearing a garland of hibiscus flowers, and driving a donkey cart whose two wheels are splashed with mud. 
On seeing him, the mer￾chant leader asks, “Has it been raining on the road [through the area]$of scarce provisions? Is there new water, firewood, and grass [ahead]?”$That man replies:$There has been a great deal of rain on the road [through the area]$of scarce provisions. 
There is plenty of new water, firewood, and grass. 
Friend, throw away the water, firewood, and grass that you already have, so as not to tire your vehicles. 
You will find new water, good firewood, and grass before long.$Hearing this, the merchant leader returns to the merchants and says:$As I was going ahead, I saw a man coming from a side road with his clothes all wet, with dark body, yellow head, and two deep red eyes, wearing a garland of hibiscus flowers, and driving a donkey cart whose two wheels were splashed with mud. 
I asked him, “Has it been raining on the road [through the area] of scarce provisions?$Is there new water, firewood, and grass [ahead]?” He replied to me,saying, “There has been a great deal of rain on the road [through the area] of scarce provisions. 
There is plenty of new water, fire￾wood, and grass. 
Friend, throw away the water, firewood, and grass that you already have, so as not to tire your vehicles. 
You will find new water, good firewood, and grass before long.”$Merchants, let us throw away the water, firewood, and grass$528^taisho530a Division 6$that we already have. 
We will find new water, firewood, and grass before long. 
Let us not tire our vehicles!$So those merchants throw away the water, firewood, and grass that they already have. 
After one day’s journey, they find no new water,$firewood, or grass. 
After two days ...
three days ...
even after seven days of travel, they still find no new water, firewood, or grass. 
After seven days have passed, they are killed by man-eating ghosts.$The second merchant leader thinks, “The first merchant leader has crossed over the danger. 
By what means can we now overcome the hardships?” Having thought thus, the second merchant leader proceeds along the road [through the area] of scarce provisions together with the five hundred carts. 
The second merchant leader goes ahead by him￾self. 
He sees a man coming from a side road with his clothes all wet,$with dark body, yellow head, and two deep red eyes, wearing a garland of hibiscus flowers, and driving a donkey chart whose two wheels are splashed with mud.$On seeing him, the second merchant leader asks, “Has it been rain￾ing on the road [through the area] of scarce provisions? Are there new water, firewood, and grass [ahead]?” That man replies:$There has been a great deal of rain on the road [through the area]$of scarce provisions. 
There is plenty of new water, firewood, and grass. 
Friend, throw away the water, firewood, and grass that you already have, so as not to tire your vehicles. 
You will find new water, good firewood, and grass before long.$Hearing this, the second merchant leader returns to the merchants and says:$While I was going ahead, I saw a man coming from a side road with his clothes all wet, with a dark body, yellow head, and two deep red eyes, wearing a garland of hibiscus flowers, and driving a donkey cart whose two wheels were splashed with mud. 
I asked him, “Has it been raining on the road [through the area] of scarce provisions? Are there new water, firewood, and grass [ahead]?”$529^taisho530b The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$He replied, “There has been a great deal of rain on the road$[through the area] ofscarce provisions. 
There is plenty of new water,$firewood, and grass. 
Friend, throw away the water, firewood, and grass that you already have, so as not to tire your vehicles. 
You will find new water, good firewood, and grass before long.”$[But,] merchants, we cannot throw away the water, firewood,$or grass that we already have. 
We should throw them away only if we find new water, firewood, and grass.$[So] they do not throw away the water, firewood, and grass that they already have. 
After one day’s journey, they find no new water, firewood,$or grass. 
After two days ...
three days ...
even after seven days of travel, they still find no new water, firewood, or grass. 
While going ahead, the second merchant leader finds that the first merchant leader and his merchants have been killed by man-eating ghosts.$Seeing this, the second merchant leader tells the merchants:$You see! The first merchant leader was foolish, ignorant, poor in understanding, and lacking wisdom. 
He himself has been killed, and all his people too have been killed. 
Merchants, if you would like to take the belongings of the first group of merchants, do so at will!$Pāyāsi, you should know that such is also the case with you. 
If you hold on to this view out of desire, aversion, fear, and delusion, and do not let go of it, you will be subject to immeasurable misfortune and also be abhorred by many people, just like the first merchant leader and his merchants.$King Pāyāsi said again:$Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says, I still hold on to this view, out of desire, aversion, fear, and delusion; I am utterly unable to let go of it. 
Why is that? If other people in other countries heard of this, they would say, “King Pāyāsi held his view for a long time, but he has been refuted, defeated, and made to abandon it by the renunciant$Kumāra Kassapa.”$For this reason, Kassapa, I hold on to this view, out of desire, aver￾sion, fear, and delusion; I am utterly unable to let go of it.$530$Division 6$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:$Pāyāsi, listen while I tell you another parable. 
The wise, on hearing a parable, understand its implication.$Suppose, Pāyāsi, that two men wanted to gamble with grains184$[as tokens]. 
The first player [on losing] furtively eats the [extra] grains$[that cause him to lose]: once, twice, three times, again and again. 
The second player thinks, “I am playing against this man, but he has cheated me many times, furtively eating the [extra] grains: once, twice, three times, again and again.”$Seeing this, he tells his companion, “Now I want to rest. 
Let us resume the game later.” Thereupon the second player leaves that place and smears the grains with poison. 
Having smeared them, he returns and tells his companion, “Come and [resume] the game with me!” So he comes and they play together. 
Again the first player furtively eats the grains: once, twice, three times, again and again. 
Having eaten the grains,$his eyes become vacant, he foams at the mouth, and is almost dying.$Then the second player utters this verse to the first player:$These grains are smeared with poison.$You ate them greedily without noticing.$You cheated me with the grains,$That was bound to make you suffer!$Pāyāsi, you should know that such is also the case with you. 
If you hold on to this view out of desire, aversion, fear, and delusion, and do not let go of it, you will be subject to immeasurable misfortune and be abhorred by many people, just as the player who cheated the other out of grains brought disaster on himself.$King Pāyāsi again said:$Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says, I still hold on to this view, out of desire, aversion, fear, and delusion; I am utterly unable to let go of it. 
Why is that? If other people in other countries heard of this, they would say “King Pāyāsi held his view for a long time, but he has been refuted, defeated, and made to abandon it by the renunciant$Kumāra Kassapa.”$531^taisho530c The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Therefore, Kassapa, I hold on to this view, out of desire, aversion,$fear, and delusion; I am utterly unable to let go of it.$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:$Pāyāsi, listen while I tell you another parable. 
The wise, on hearing a parable, understand its implication.$Suppose, Pāyāsi, a pig farmer, while walking along a road, sees a large amount of dry dung without an owner. 
He thinks, “This dung can feed many pigs. 
Let me take it, load myself up, and leave.” So he takes it and leaves.$On the way he encounters heavy rain. 
The dung, dissolving and oozing, fouls his body, but he keeps on carrying it along, never dis￾carding it. 
Consequently he experiences immeasurable misfortune and is abhorred by many people.$You should know, Pāyāsi, that such is also the case with you. 
If you hold on to this view out of desire, aversion, fear, and delusion, and do not let go of it, you will experience immeasurable misfortune and be abhorred by many people, just like that pig farmer.$King Pāyāsi again said:$Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says, I still hold on to this view, out of desire, aversion, fear, and delusion; I am utterly unable to let go of it. 
Why is that? If other people in other countries heard of this, they would say, “King Pāyāsi held his view for a long time, but he has been refuted, defeated, and made to abandon it by the renunciant$Kumāra Kassapa.”$Therefore, Kassapa, I hold on to this view, out of desire, aversion,$fear, and delusion; I am utterly unable to let go of it.$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:$Pāyāsi, listen while I tell you one last parable. 
It will be good if you understand it. 
If not, I will not teach you the Dharma any more.$Suppose, Pāyāsi, a large pig, the king of five hundred pigs, while walking along a dangerous road, encounters a tiger on the way.$On seeing the tiger, the pig thinks:$532^taisho531a Division 6$If I fight with this tiger, he will definitely kill me. 
If I run away in fear, my kinsmen will slight me. 
By what means can I get out of this trouble?$Having thought thus, he tells the tiger, “If you want to fight, I can fight with you. 
If not, then let me pass.” Hearing this, the tiger tells the pig,$“I allow you to fight with me. 
I will not let you pass.”$The pig says further, “Tiger, wait a little, while I put on the armor of my grandfather’s time, and then I will return to fight.” Hearing this,$the tiger thinks, “He is no match for me, let alone in the armor of his grandfather’s time.” So he tells the pig, “Do as you like!” Then the pig returns to his own cesspit and rolls around in feces, smearing his body with it up to the eyes. 
Then he goes to the tiger and says, “If you want to fight, I can fight with you. 
If not, let me pass.”$On seeing the pig, the tiger thinks, “I never even eat food that has worms in it, in order to protect my teeth, so I certainly won’t get close to this foul pig.” Thinking thus, the tiger tells the pig, “I will let you pass rather than fight with you.” Having passed, the pig utters a verse to the tiger:$Tiger, you have four feet.$I too have four feet.$Come and fight with me!$What do you fear that you walk away?$Then, on hearing this, the tiger also utters a verse in response to the pig:$Your bristles stand up like a dense forest,$You lowest among animals!$Go away, pig! Quickly!$The stench of feces is unbearable.$Then the pig, boasting, utters another verse:$[Citizens of] the two countries of Magadha and Aṅga$Will hear that I fought with you.$Come and battle with me!$What do you fear that you walk away?$533^taisho531b The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$Hearing this, the tiger uttered another verse:$With all the bristles on your body fouled,$Your stench chokes me, pig.$If you want to fight for victory,$I now concede you victory.$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:$Pāyāsi, such is also the case with you. 
If you hold on to this view out of desire, aversion, fear, and delusion, and do not let go of it, you will be subject to immeasurable misfortune and be abhorred by many people,$just as the tiger conceded victory to the pig.$Having heard this, King Pāyāsi said:$When the venerable one told the first parable, about the sun and the moon, I understood it on hearing it and joyfully received it with respect.$However, I wanted to get further excellent and wise teachings from the venerable Kumāra Kassapa, and for this reason I asked you again and again. 
I now go for refuge to the venerable Kumāra Kassapa.$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said, “Pāyāsi, you should not go to me for refuge. 
I go to the Buddha for refuge. 
You too should go to him for refuge.”$King Pāyāsi said:$Venerable sir, I now go for refuge to the Buddha, the Dharma and the community of monks. 
May the venerable Kumāra Kassapa accept me,$on behalf of the Buddha, as a lay follower. 
From this day forth I take refuge until the end of my life. 
Venerable Kumāra Kassapa, from this day forth I will practice charity and make merit.$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa asked, “Pāyāsi, you want to practice charity and make merit, but how many people will you give to? And how long will it last?”$King Pāyāsi said, “I will give to a hundred people or even a thousand people, for one day, two days, or even seven days.”$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:$534$Division 6$King, if you practice charity and make merit by giving to a hundred people or even a thousand people, for one day, two days, or even seven days, then renunciants and brahmins in the various directions will all hear that King Pāyāsi held on to his view for a long time, but has [now]$been refuted, defeated, and made to abandon it by the renunciant$Kumāra Kassapa.$Hearing this, people in the various directions will all come from afar. 
But if within those seven days, some do not get to eat the food that the king gives in faith, then the king will make no merit and will not get to experience long-lasting happiness.$Suppose, King Pāyāsi, [that there are] seeds that are neither broken nor spoiled, neither split nor damaged, not harmed by wind, sun, or water, and that have been stored away safely since the autumn; and suppose that a householder thoroughly ploughs a fertile field. 
Having thoroughly prepared the land, he sows the seeds at the appropriate time,$but there is no timely rain or other supply of water. 
What do you think,$Pāyāsi? Would those seeds germinate and grow?$He replied, “They would not.”$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:$Pāyāsi, such is also the case with you if you practice charity to produce merit by giving to a hundred people, or even a thousand people, for one day, two days, or even seven days.$Renunciants and brahmins in the various directions will all hear that King Pāyāsi held on to his view for a long time, but has [now]$been refuted, defeated, and made to abandon it by the renunciant$Kumāra Kassapa. 
Hearing this, people in the various directions will all come from afar. 
But if within those seven days, some do not get to eat the almsfood that the king gives in faith, then the king will make no merit and will not get to experience long-lasting happiness.$King Pāyāsi asked further, “Venerable sir, what should I do?”$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa replied:$Pāyāsi, you should practice charity and make merit by providing alms￾food constantly. 
If, King Pāyāsi, you practice charity and make merit$535^taisho531c The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$by supplying almsfood constantly, then renunciants and brahmins in the various directions will all hear that King Pāyāsi held on to his view for a long time, but has [now] been refuted, defeated, and made to abandon it by the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa. 
Hearing this, people in the various directions will all come from afar, and will be able to receive the almsfood that the king gives in faith. 
Then the king will make merit and experience long-lasting happiness.$Suppose, King Pāyāsi, [that there are] seeds that are neither broken nor spoiled, neither split nor damaged, not harmed by wind, sun, or water, and that were stored away safely in the autumn; and suppose that a householder thoroughly ploughs a fertile field. 
Having thoroughly prepared the land, he sows the seeds at the appropriate time, and there is timely rain or some other supply of water. 
What do you think, Pāyāsi?$Would those seeds germinate and grow?$He replied, “They would.”$Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said:$Pāyāsi, such is also the case with you. 
If you practice charity and make merit by providing almsfood constantly, then renunciants and brahmins in the various directions will all hear that King Pāyāsi held on to his view for a long time, but has [now] been refuted, defeated, and made to abandon it by the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa. 
Hearing this, people in the various directions will all come from afar, and all of them will be able to receive the almsfood that the king gives in faith. 
Then the king will make merit and experience long-lasting happiness.$Thereupon King Pāyāsi said, “Venerable sir, from now on I will practice charity and make merit by providing almsfood constantly.”$Then with innumerable skillful means, Venerable Kumāra Kassapa taught the Dharma to King Pāyāsi and to the brahmins and householders of Setavyā,$exhorting, encouraging, and delighting them. 
Having with innumerable skillful means taught them the Dharma, having exhorted, encouraged, and delighted them, he remained silent.$Then, after Venerable Kumāra Kassapa had taught the Dharma to King$Pāyāsi and the brahmins and householders of Setavyā, exhorting, encouraging,$536^taisho532a Division 6$and delighting them, they got up from their seats, paid homage to Venerable$Kumāra Kassapa, circumambulated him three times, and departed.$Although King Pāyāsi practiced charity and made merit, [the almsfood included] very bad, coarse, and inferior bean gruel and vegetables, and only one piece of ginger. 
He also gave coarse and inferior robes. 
The kitchen supervisor at that time was named Uttara. 
While practicing charity to produce merit on behalf of King Pāyāsi he asked some elder monks to make this aspi￾ration: “If this charity brings retribution for merit, let King Pāyāsi not expe￾rience it either in this life or the next.”$King Pāyāsi heard that Uttara, while practicing charity and making merit,$always asked some elder monks to make this aspiration: “If this charity brings retribution for merit, let King Pāyāsi not experience it either in this life or the next.” Having heard this, he sent for him and asked:$Uttara, is it true that while practicing charity to make merit on my behalf you ask elder monks to make this aspiration, “If this charity brings retribution for merit, let King Pāyāsi not experience it either in this life or the next”?$Uttara replied:$Yes, your majesty. 
Why is that? Although your majesty practices charity and makes merit, [the alms include] very bad, coarse, and inferior bean gruel, vegetables, and only one piece of ginger. 
Your majesty, such food cannot even be touched by hands, much less eaten. 
[Also] your majesty gives coarse and inferior robes. 
Your majesty, such robes cannot even be stepped on with one’s feet, much less worn. 
I respect your majesty rather than what is given.$Therefore, your majesty, I do not wish your majesty to experience the retribution for such inferior alms.$On hearing this, King Pāyāsi said, “Uttara, from now on you should pro￾vide food such as I eat and give robes such as I wear.” So, from then on Uttara provided food such as the king ate and gave robes such as the king wore.$Then, because of his supervising the practice of charity for King Pāyāsi,$Uttara was reborn at the breaking up of the body, after death, among the four divine kings. 
King Pāyāsi, for his practice of charity without sincerity, was$537$The Madhyama Āgama, Volume I$reborn at the breaking up of the body, after death, in the empty palace of the$Acacia Grove. 
Venerable Gavampati often wandered near the empty palace of the Acacia Grove. 
Venerable Gavampati saw King Pāyāsi in the distance and asked, “Who are you?”$King Pāyāsi replied, “Venerable Gavampati, have you ever heard that in the continent of Jambudīpa there was a king of Setavyā named Pāyāsi?”$Venerable Gavampati replied, “I have heard that in the continent of Jam￾budīpa there was a king of Setavyā named Pāyāsi.”$King Pāyāsi said, “Venerable Gavampati, I was he, originally named$Pāyāsi.”$Venerable Gavampati asked further:$King Pāyāsi held to this view, this tenet: “There are no future lives;$beings are not reborn.” For what reason was he reborn here in the little empty palace of the Acacia Grove dependent on the four divine kings?$King Pāyāsi said:$Venerable Gavampati, I did indeed hold this view, but I had been refuted,$defeated, and made to abandon it by the venerable renunciant Kumāra$Kassapa. 
If, Venerable Gavampati, you return to the continent of Jam￾budīpa, please tell the people in the continent of Jambudīpa that when practicing charity to make merit, they should give with sincerity, give with their own hands, give having gone there themselves, give with steadfast faith, give with understanding of deeds and the results of deeds.$Why? So that they may not experience the results of [malpracticed]$charity, in the manner of King Pāyāsi of Setavyā. 
King Pāyāsi was a practitioner of charity, but because he gave without sincerity, he was reborn in the little empty palace of the Acacia Grove, dependent on the four divine kings.$Then Venerable Gavampati consented by remaining silent.$Thereafter, on his occasional descents to the continent of Jambudīpa,$Venerable Gavampati told people all over the continent of Jambudīpa:$Give with sincerity, give with your own hands, give having gone there yourselves, give with steadfast faith, give with understanding of deeds$538^taisho532b Division 6$and the results of deeds. 
Why? So that you may not experience the results of [malpracticed] charity, in the manner of King Pāyāsi of$Setavyā. 
King Pāyāsi was a practitioner of charity, but because he gave without sincerity he was reborn [only] in the little empty palace of the$Acacia Grove, dependent on the four divine kings.$This is what Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said. 
Having heard what Ven￾erable Kumāra Kassapa said, King Pāyāsi, the brahmins and householders of Setavyā, and the monks were delighted and remembered it well.$539$Notes$1 T.55.2145:4c5–6. 
All references in this format were retrieved from and are based on the CBETA corpus (CD Version 2009), which contains a digital edition of the Taishō$Canon.$2 The three others are the Chang ahan jing (Dīrghāgama, T. 
1), the Za ahan jing (Saṃ-$yuktāgama, T. 
99), and the Zengyi ahan jing (Ekottarikāgama, T. 
125).$3 All Chinese Āgamas have been translated into Japanese and Korean.$4 In the Pāli canon the Sutta-piṭaka includes a fifth collection of texts, the Khudda￾kanikāya. 
The schools of the northern tradition knew a similar group of texts, but some established it as a separate piṭaka, the Kṣudraka-piṭaka, instead of including it in the Sūtra-piṭaka (though the designation Kṣudrakāgama is also found in some sources: Egaku Mayeda, “Japanese Studies on the Schools of the Chinese Āgamas,”$in Heinz Bechert, ed., Zur Schulzugehörigkeit von Werken der Hīnayāna-Literatur$[Göttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1985], p. 
95; Étienne Lamotte, Le Traité de la Grande Vertu de Sagesse de Nāgārjuna, vol. 
3 [Louvain: Université de Louvain$Institut Orientaliste, 1970]). 
Piṭaka or Āgama, the fifth collection was never translated as such into Chinese.$5 For want of better terms we subsume under the term “northern tradition” the textual traditions of the schools in Northern India and Central Asia that were codified in lan￾guages other than Pāli; the textual traditions that were transmitted to Sri Lanka and eventually resulted in the Pāli canon are correspondingly termed “southern.” This distinction may be blunt, but is nevertheless useful.$6 See Bhikkhu Anālayo, “The Chinese Madhyama-āgama and the Pāli Majjhima￾nikāya—In the Footsteps of Thich Minh Chau,” Indian International Journal of$Buddhist Studies 9 (2008): 1–21.$7 The figures cited here are query results from the digital version of Chizen Akanuma’s$Kanpa shibu shiagon goshōroku (comcatV3.xml, available at http://mbingenheimer.net/$tools/comcat/indexComcat.html). 
Added together, these numbers slightly exceed the total of two hundred and twenty-two, because in some cases one sutra has more than one parallel. 
Moreover, these numbers are subject to debate. 
Bhikkhu Anālayo, in his detailed study, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya (Taipei: Dharma Drum,$2011, p. 
9), allows for only ninety-six parallels of the Zhong ahan jing in the MN.$While the absolute numbers will always depend on the definition of “parallel,” this$541$general ratio will hold true: less than half of the sutras of T. 
26 are found in the MN,$most of the rest are found in the three other Nikāyas, and for a small percentage there seems to be no clear parallel in the Pāli corpus. 
Akanuma’s catalogue, Kanpa shibu shiagon goshōroku (The Comparative Catalogue of Chinese Āgamas and Pāli Nikāyas)$(Nagoya: Hajinkaku shobō, 1929) is now dated; for the MN parallels one should refer to Bhikkhu Anālayo and Roderick S.

The identity of Daoci is unclear. 
The Lidai sanbao ji (T.49.2034:70c3)$names Daozu (probably identical with Zhu Daozu [347–419]) as the scribe for this translation and this is also the name that appears in the Taishō byline (T.1.26:421a7).$The Taishō edition, following the Tripiṭaka Koreana, has included Daoci’s text as postscript without mentioning the name of the author (though the text itself clearly identifies Daoci as the author). 
There are other early sources that give Daoci as the author of the preface (cf. 
the independent report in the Kaiyuan shijiao lu$(T.55.2154:505b6). 
The Lidai sanbao ji is much less reliable than the Chu sanzang jiji and is responsible for many spurious attributions of pre-Sui Chinese Buddhist texts. 
Naming Daozu of Wu as the scribe who set down T. 
26 should therefore be considered one of the many mistakes made by Fei Changfang, the author of the Lidai sanbao ji (a mere scribal error of zu for ci is unlikely). 
The mistake found its way into later catalogues (e.g., T.55.2149:246b21), the Tripiṭaka Koreana, and from there into the Taishō edition.$19 T.2.125:549a10. 
This version of events is taken up in Dharmanandin’s biography in the Liang gaoseng zhuan (T.50.2059:328b19). 
Dharmanandin was also involved in the translation of Abhidharma scriptures, which he recorded as recited by Saṁgha￾bhūti (T.50.2059:328b8).$20 E.g., T.55.2146:129a2.$21 Dao’an refers to this earlier preface in his preface to the Zengyi ahan jing (T. 
125)$(T.55.2145:64b1). 
It is also attested in Fajing’s Zhongjing mulu (T.55.2146:147b27).$22 Kōgen Mizuno has reported on these findings in “Kanyaku Chūagonkyō to Zōichi￾agonkyō no yakushutsu ni tsuite,” Okurayama gakuin kiyō 2 (1956): 41–90;$“Chūagonkyō kaidai,” in Kokuyaku issai-gyō (Agon bu) (Tokyo: Taitō, 1969, revised ed.), vol. 
6, pp. 
403–411; and “Kanyaku no Chūagonkyō to Zōichiagonkyō,” Bukkyō$Notes$545$kenkyū 18 (1989): 1–42. 
His inference that the same team translated these sutras is based mainly on the identical opening and closing formulas and the general style of the texts.$23 Jen-Jou Hung, Marcus Bingenheimer, and Simon Wiles, “Quantitative Evidence for a Hypothesis regarding the Attribution of early Buddhist Translations,” Literary and$Linguistic Computing 2009. 
DOI: 10.1093/llc/fqp036.$24 I am grateful to Jan Nattier, who alerted me to the problems with the second part of$Mizuno’s thesis discussed below.$25 First translation in fifty-nine juan at T.55.2145:10b23, second translation (today’s T.$26) is at T.55.2145:10c7. 
Sengyou generally marks non-extant texts with jinque.$26 T.53.2121:243a7$27 Entry at T.55.2147:178b20.$28 In some sources mistakenly written as Kang Hua.$29 The Gaoseng zhuan does not mention Daoci, Li Bao, or Tang Hua. 
It does, however,$state that Huiyuan’s disciple Huichi (337–413) (T.50.2059:361b25–26 and 329a22)$was involved in the translation. 
On the other hand, the Gaoseng zhuan (T.50.2059:$374c23) mentions a Daoci from Yuzhou, but at a time some hundred years later. 
The contradiction can be settled on logical grounds. 
If we accept Daoci’s preface in the$Chu sanzang jiji as genuine, and there is little reason to doubt its authenticity, we also have to accept its account as authoritative, since Daoci was directly involved in the translation process. 
The Daoci mentioned in the Gaoseng zhuan must have been another monk with the same name.$30 T.50.2059:328b12.$31 T.1.26:809b6–8.$32 For a discussion of Sengyou’s assessment of Zhu Fonian, see Jan Nattier, “Re-Eval￾uating Zhu Fonian’s Shizhu duanjie jing (T.

Juli 1981 (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1983), p. 
33, remarks that if the source text of T. 
26 did indeed pass through a Gāndhārī stage, then attribution to$Notes$546$the Dharmaguptakas should be considered as well, since this is the school most closely associated with this language. 
In the light of later research by von Hinüber (“Origin and Varieties of Buddhist Sanskrit,” p. 
354) and Fumio Enomoto (A Comprehensive$Study of the Chinese Saṃyuktāgama, p. 
106), this has become unlikely. 
Among other reasons, the fact that there is an overlap of seven sutras between T. 
26 and the Chang ahan jing (T. 
1), which is widely believed to be a translation of the Dharmaguptaka$Dīrghāgama, makes an attribution of T.

Chung for making a draft copy of the section available to me.$36 For a general reconstruction of the original order, see Egaku Mayeda, Genshi bukkyō$shōten no seiritsushi kenkyū (Tokyo: Sankibo, 1964), pp. 
649–662; for a more detailed account of the differences between the Pāli and Chinese versions of one division, see$Bucknell, “The Structure of the Sagātha-Vagga of the Saṃyutta-Nikāya.”$37 To my knowledge, the earliest witness for the character counts in the Zhong ahan jing is the first edition of the Tripiṭaka Koreana (1011–1029) approximately one-third of which was preserved in the collection of Nanzenji (Kyoto). 
Of this earliest print witness of the Zhong ahan jing only fascicles 2–4, 6–9, 21, and 51–54 have survived.$(Parts of the first edition of the Tripiṭaka Koreana have been digitized by the Research$Institute of Tripiṭaka Koreana, Koryo Daejanggyeong Yongguso, Seoul.) Character counts for the Zhong ahan jing are also included in the Jin or Zhaocheng edition$(printed 1139–1178). 
Character counts are a form of metadata attached to help with preserving the integrity of the text. 
A standardized layout seems to be a precondition for character counts, since only if the number of characters per line and the number of lines per sheet or woodblock are fixed is it possible to calculate them easily and reliably.$38 Zhongguo Fojiao Xiehui, ed., Fangshan shijing (Beijing: Zhongguo fojiao tushu wenwu guan, 1989), vol. 
21, pp. 
1–592.$39 As mentioned above (n. 
37), only twelve fascicles from the first carving of the Tripi-$ṭaka Koreana (1011–1029) have survived. 
Next to that we have the Jin edition as an early witness. 
It is contemporaneous with the Fangshan edition, but its version of the$Zhong ahan jing is not complete; fascicles 2–3, 9, 25, 41, 51–52, 56, and 59 are lost.$The remains of the Jin canon are reproduced in the Zhonghua dazang jing (Shanghai:$Zhonghua shuju, 1984–1996). 
One single fascicle (no. 
36) of the Zhong ahan jing contained in the Liao canon (c. 
983–1031) has survived: item no.

Dhammaññū-sutta, AN IV 113.$42 We chose to use the Pāli term khattiya instead of the translation “warrior,” to make clear that the term refers to the caste, not to a specific group of warriors.$43 AN IV 115 speaks instead of having a desire to see noble ones, ariyānaṃ dassanakāmo.$Perhaps the original used for the Chinese translation also referred to such a “desire,”$as the character wang, used in the present context, could be a result of mistaking kāma, “desire,” for kama, “going” (√kram).$44 Fengxing, probably corresponding to the Indian dharati/dhāreti, e.g., in the frequently used phrase bhagavato sutvā bhikkhū dhāressantī. 
The Chinese characters mean lit￾erally, “receive [orders/teachings] and act upon,” hence it is often translated as “to practice accordingly” or the like. 
To judge from the Indian corpus, the phrase was originally understood as “to uphold,” “to bear in mind,” “to remember.” Later Chinese commentators and lexicographers were aware of this at times (T.40.1819: 844a29–$b1 and, probably based on this, HDC [s.v.]). 
Moreover, in T. 
26 and elsewhere one finds fengxing in contexts where only “remember” makes sense (e.g., in Sāriputta’s answers to Mahā Koṭṭhita in sutra 29). 
Based on this and other passages, we chose to render fengxing as “remember well” in the closing formula.

51–55.$45 Cf. 
Pāricchattaka-sutta, AN IV 117.$46 Wang. 
The translator(s) apparently took an Indic equivalent of jālaka to mean “net,”$which indeed is one possible meaning. 
Here, however, the relevant meaning is “bud.”$47 Le zhu shi, Pāli sukha-vihāra. 
In the Chinese textual tradition the final character shi,$“room, abode,” is sometimes mistaken as kong, “emptiness.” Another variant is ding,$“concentration.” That kong is a scribal error is supported by the lack of a corresponding term in the Pāli version of the formula.$48 Cf. 
Nagaropama-sutta, AN IV 106.$49 Here the text adds “emptiness,” probably owing to a copyist’s error, as explained in note 47, for le zhu shi, above.$50 Cf. 
Udakūpama-sutta, AN IV 11.$51 The formulation found at this point in MĀ 4 could be understood to imply that the fetters are already abandoned before the attainment of stream-entry. 
The Pāli parallel$AN IV 12, however, reads tiṇṇaṃ saññojanānaṃ parikkhayā sotāpanno hoti, “by abandoning the three fetters he becomes a stream-enterer.” That the eradication of the three fetters takes place at the moment of stream-entry itself can be seen more explicitly in Sn 231 and AN I 242.$52 The present passage reads literally, “born in that interval,” Pāli opapātika (AN IV 12).$Notes$548$53 Cf. 
Aggikkhandhopama-sutta, AN IV 128.$54 Cheng can render pratijñā (Akira Hirakawa, Bukkyō kanbon daijiten [Buddhist Chi￾nese-Sanskrit Dictionary] (Tokyo: Reiyūkai, 1997], p. 
903), so that the intended sense would be similar to the Pāli parallel, AN IV 128: assamaṇassa samaṇapaṭiññassa abrahmacārissa brahmacāripaṭiññassa.$55 No reference to a fireplace is found in the Pāli parallel. 
Since Buddhist monks and nuns in ancient India were not allowed to kindle a fire to warm themselves, one would not expect them to be given a hut with a fireplace.$56 Cf.

For an explanation of how the second epithet of the Buddha, “Arahant,”$came to be translated in this way, see Jan Nattier, “The Ten Epithets of the Buddha in the Translations of Zhi Qian,” Annual Report of the International Research Institute for Advanced Buddhology at Soka University 6 (2003): 217–219.$63 On the pre-Kumārajīva Chinese translation of anuttarapuruṣadamyasārathi as wushang shi and daofayu, see Thich Minh Chau, The Chinese Madhyama Āgama and the Pāli$Majjhima Nikāya (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1991, reprint), p. 
326; Nattier, “The$Ten Epithets of the Buddha in the Translations of Zhi Qian,” pp. 
244–245, 247. 
Even though this seeming misreading of damya for dharma might reflect an independent interpretation of the term that already existed in India, we here assume, against our text, that the correct form of the epithet is as rendered above.$64 Cf. 
Rathavinīta-sutta, MN I 145.$65 The use of the expression “renunciant Gotama” would have been chosen by Sāriputta on purpose in order not to give away his identity as a co-disciple of the Buddha. 
For a disciple the proper way to refer to the Buddha would rather be “World-honored$One” (bhagavā).$66 Adopting the variant reading er.$67 The text gives the name of the mother just as ci, Mettā.$68 Cf. 
Sabbāsava-sutta, MN I 6.$69 The passage actually reads “does not remove, discard, forsake, and get rid of them,”$which is a textual corruption.$Notes$549$70 Cf. 
Loṇaphala-sutta, AN I 249.$71 In the Chinese, this assertion and the preceding one are identically worded. 
However,$from the Pāli parallel (AN I 249) and the context, it is clear that a distinction is being made between two different assertions: first, that karmic retribution is exactly com￾mensurate with the deed, resulting in a determinism that precludes the holy life and the ending of suffering; second, the general proposition that the results of deeds will inevitably be experienced.$72 Cf. 
Vappa-sutta, AN II 196.$73 AN II 196 adds that he also has eradicated ignorance and aroused knowledge, thereby indicating that the person in question is a fully awakened one.$74 Cf. 
Titthāyatanādi-sutta, AN I 173.$75 Taking the shi in the meaning of “to approve, to endorse” (HDC, s.v.).$76 Nei yin nei. 
Yin nei signifies “reason and authority” (William E. 
Soothill and Lewis$Hodous, A Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms [London: Kegan, 1937], p. 
205),$and nei can render antargata (Hirakawa, Bukkyō kanbon daijiten, p. 
160); hence, the sense appears to be “on being included in this reason,” or, more freely, “it would follow logically.”$77 Cf. 
Ambalaṭṭhikārāhulovāda-sutta, MN I 414.$78 Here and below the text actually reads “pure,” which must be a textual error; cf. 
the discussion in Anālayo, “Oral Dimensions of Pāli Discourses,” pp.

Margaret Cone’s suggestion of “noble youth (of whatever birth)” (A Dictionary of Pāli, vol. 
1. 
[a-kh] [Oxford: Pāli Text Society, 2001]) is also possible, perhaps preferable, in most cases, but there are passages where the term does not seem to encompass only the young.$86 Cf. 
Devadaha-sutta, MN II 214.$87 Zeng e, Skt. 
kutsana (Hirakawa, Bukkyō kanbon daijiten, p. 
503).$88 Zi duan ku. 
This is one of several cases in T. 
26 where Chinese duan seems to have resulted from a confusion of prahāṇa (“getting rid of,” “eliminate,” duan)$Notes$550$and pradhāna (“exertion”). 
This could be due to a Prakritic conflation of Skt. 
prahāṇa and pradhāna in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit prahāna, or else due to a genuine alternative interpretation of the passage in the northern tradition. 
(There are other instances in the northern tradition where prahāṇa is preferred over pradhāna; e.g., in the list of the$“four correct kinds of elimination,” catvāri samyak-prahāṇāni/si zheng duan. 
The$Saṅghadeva team consistently rendered the pra-√ha in their Prakrit source as duan.$89 The dialogic structure in the Chinese is ambivalent here. 
Following the Pāli, we con￾sider the rhetorical question and its answer as part of the monks’speech.$90 Cf. 
Pāṭaliya–sutta, SN IV 340.$91 Here and in the two instances above, the term shi huan appears to be a translation error. 
The text makes sense when, as in the Pāli, the headman asks first only if the$Buddha knows magic. 
There it is only after the Buddha answers in the affirmative that the headman equates knowing magic with being a magician and is reproached for doing so.$92 The Chinese character ji is usually restricted to female singers and has the connotation of “prostitute.” Here it is perhaps used rather like the English “songstress” or “crooner.”$93 Zhai, Pāli yiṭṭha (SN IV 348).$94 Wu shang ren shang zhi fa. 
We follow the variant readings found in the Chinese editions of the canon, which omit the second shang.$95 Cf.

Nirodha-sutta, AN III 192.$98 Baijing, lit., “spotless, pure.” The Taishō note for this name gives Upavāna, the name of the protagonist in the Pāli parallel. 
It is difficult, however, to see how Upavāna could have been rendered as Baijing. 
The name in the Indic original could have been$Vimala or perhaps Suddha, Subha, or Sukka. 
However, the name of the well-attested elder Vimala is rendered differently below, being transcribed as Weimoluo$(T.01.26.472a2–3). 
In sutra 32 of our text (Shi) Baijing renders the name of the$Buddha’s father, Suddhodana. 
Elsewhere in the canon Baijing renders the name of the nun Subhā (e.g., at T.2.100:483b27, or at T.4.200:239b16).$99 Cf.

Mahāhatthipadopama-sutta, MN I 184.$114 This appears to be an error (mind objects do not require light), an unwarranted repetition of the corresponding passage from the description of visual cognition.$115 The text literally has “the external forms and mind objects cognized by mind con￾sciousness.” This appears to be another case of confusion with the earlier passage referring to visual cognition. 
The same applies for the passage stating that the mind and its objects belong to the material form aggregate.$116 Cf. 
Saccavibhaṅga-sutta, MN III 248.$117 Adopting the variant zheng instead of xin.$118 Cf. 
Acchariya-abbhūta-sutta, MN III 118.$119 From the context it is clear that ru yi zu refers to “supernormal power” (Pāli iddhi￾vidhā/iddhi-ānubhāva), both in this sutra and in nos. 
36 and 60. 
Elsewhere, however$(e.g., sutras 35, 37, 62, 69), it has its more usual meaning, “bases of supernormal power” (iddhi-pāda), and is translated accordingly.$120 This may be the elder Gavāṃpati, though his name is transcribed differently at$T01.26:532a25–29, where it is confirmed by the Pāli (unlike the present case, for which there is no parallel Pāli discourse). 
Since transcriptions of names are usually very consistent in T. 
26, this case needs further research.$121 Xutuoye. 
According to the Ding Fubao Foxue Dacidian (s.v.) this is a variant tran￾scription of Sutuoyi, for which again the Ding Fubao gives Sudāya, Sudāna, and to which the Foguang dacidian adds “Pāli: Sudāyi.” However, Sudāyi seems not to be attested. 
The case is problematic and needs further research.$122 The Chinese transcription is unique; the intended name may have been Pūrṇamāśa/$Puṇṇamāsa or Pindola Bhāradvāja. 
The name Binnoujiatuniao is listed under Puṇṇa$Notes$552$Mantāniputta by Akanuma Chizen, but this is not conclusive since Akanuma generally lists parallel occurrences, which are not always semantically equivalent; Indo bukkyō$koyū meishi jiten (Nagoya: Hajinkaku shobō, 1930–1931); reprinted as Dictionary of Buddhist Proper Names (Delhi: Sri Satguru Publications, 1994), s.v.

$1675 School Street $Moraga, California 94556 $Printed in the United States of America$A Message on the Publication of the $English Tripiṭaka $The Buddhist canon is said to contain eighty-four thousand different teachings. 
$I believe that this is because the Buddha’s basic approach was to prescribe a $different treatment for every spiritual ailment, much as a doctor prescribes a $different medicine for every medical ailment. 
Thus his teachings were always $appropriate for the particular suffering individual and for the time at which the $teaching was given, and over the ages not one of his prescriptions has failed to $relieve the suffering to which it was addressed. 
$Ever since the Buddha’s Great Demise over twenty-five hundred years ago, $his message of wisdom and compassion has spread throughout the world. 
Yet $no one has ever attempted to translate the entire Buddhist canon into English $throughout the history of Japan. 
It is my greatest wish to see this done and to $make the translations available to the many English-speaking people who have $never had the opportunity to learn about the Buddha’s teachings. 
$Of course, it would be impossible to translate all of the Buddha’s eighty-four $thousand teachings in a few years. 
I have, therefore, had one hundred thirty-nine $of the scriptural texts in the prodigious Taishō edition of the Chinese Buddhist $canon selected for inclusion in the First Series of this translation project. 
$It is in the nature of this undertaking that the results are bound to be criticized. 
$Nonetheless, I am convinced that unless someone takes it upon himself or herself $to initiate this project, it will never be done. 
At the same time, I hope that an $improved, revised edition will appear in the future. 
$It is most gratifying that, thanks to the efforts of more than a hundred Buddhist $scholars from the East and the West, this monumental project has finally gotten $off the ground. 
May the rays of the Wisdom of the Compassionate One reach $each and every person in the world. 
$ NUMATA Yehan $ Founder of the English $August 7, 1991 Tripiṭaka Project v$Editorial Foreword $In the long history of Buddhist transmission throughout East Asia, translations $of Buddhist texts were often carried out as national projects supported and $funded by emperors and political leaders. 
The BDK English Tripiṭaka project, $on the other hand, began as a result of the dream and commitment of one man. 
$In January 1982 Dr. 
NUMATA Yehan, founder of Bukkyō Dendō Kyōkai (Society $for the Promotion of Buddhism), initiated the monumental task of translating $the complete Taishō shinshū daizōkyō edition of the Chinese Tripiṭaka (Buddhist $canon) into the English language. 
Under his leadership, a special preparatory $committee was organized in April 1982. 
By July of the same year the Translation $Committee of the English Tripiṭaka was officially convened. 
$The initial Committee included the following members: (late) HANAYAMA$Shōyū (Chairperson), (late) BANDŌ Shōjun, ISHIGAMI Zennō, (late) KAMATA$Shigeo, (late) KANAOKA Shūyū, MAYEDA Sengaku, (late) NARA Yasuaki, $(late) SAYEKI Shinkō, (late) SHIOIRI Ryōtatsu, TAMARU Noriyoshi, (late) $TAMURA Kwansei, (late) URYŪZU Ryūshin, and YUYAMA Akira. 
Assistant $members of the Committee were as follows: KANAZAWA Atsushi, WATANABE$Shōgo, Rolf Giebel of New Zealand, and Rudy Smet of Belgium. 
$After holding planning meetings on a monthly basis, the Committee selected $one hundred and thirty-nine texts for the First Series of the project, estimated $to be one hundred printed volumes in all. 
The texts selected were not limited to $those originally written in India but also included works composed in China $and Japan. 
While the publication of the First Series proceeds, the texts for the $Second Series will be selected from among the remaining works; this process $will continue until all the texts, in Japanese as well as in Chinese, have been $published. 
Given the huge scope of this project, accomplishing the English trans￾lations of all the Chinese and Japanese texts in the Taishō canon may take as $long as one hundred years or more. 
Nevertheless, as Dr. 
NUMATA wished, it is $the sincere hope of the Committee that this project will continue until completion, $even after all the present members have passed away. 
$vii$Editorial Foreword$Dr. 
NUMATA passed away on May 5, 1994, at the age of ninety-seven. 
He $entrusted his son, Mr. 
NUMATA Toshihide with the continuation and completion $of the English Tripiṭaka project. 
Mr. 
Numata served for twenty-three years, leading $the project forward with enormous progress before his sudden passing on February $16, 2017, at the age of eighty-four. 
The Committee previously lost its able and $devoted first Chairperson, Professor HANAYAMA Shōyū, on June 16, 1995, at $the age of sixty-three. 
In October 1995 the Committee elected Professor MAYEDA$Sengaku (then Vice President of Musashino Women’s College) as Chairperson, $and upon the retirement of Professor Mayeda in July 2016, the torch was passed $to me to serve as the third Chairperson. 
Despite these losses and changes we, the $Editorial Committee members, have renewed our determination to carry out the $noble ideals set by Dr. 
NUMATA. 
Present members of the Committee are Kenneth $K. 
Tanaka (Chairperson), MAYEDA Sengaku, ICHISHIMA Shōshin, ISHIGAMI$Zennō, KATSURA Shōryū, MINOWA Kenryō, SAITŌ Akira, SHIMODA Masahiro, $WATANABE Shōgo, and YONEZAWA Yoshiyasu. 
$The Numata Center for Buddhist Translation and Research was established $in November 1984, in Berkeley, California, U.S.A., to assist in the publication $of the translated texts. 
The Publication Committee was organized at the Numata $Center in December 1991. 
In 2010, the Numata Center’s operations were merged $with Bukkyō Dendō Kyōkai America, Inc. 
(BDK America), and BDK America $continues to oversee the publication side of the English Tripiṭaka project in close $cooperation with the Editorial Committee in Tokyo. 
$At the time of this writing, in July 2019, the project has completed about sixty￾five percent of the seven thousand one hundred and eighty-five Taishō pages of $texts selected for the First Series. 
Much work still lies ahead of us but we are $committed to the completion of the remaining texts in order to realize the grand $vision of Dr. 
Numata, shared by Mr. 
Numata and Professor Hanayama, to make $the Buddhist canon more readily accessible to the English-speaking world. 
$ Kenneth K. 
Tanaka $ Chairperson $ Editorial Committee of $ the BDK English Tripiṭaka viii ix$Publisher’s Foreword $On behalf of the members of the Publication Committee, I am happy to present $this volume as the latest contribution to the BDK English Tripiṭaka Series. 
The $Publication Committee members have worked to ensure that this volume, as all $other volumes in the series, has gone through a rigorous process of editorial efforts. 
$The initial translation and editing of the Buddhist scriptures found in this $and other BDK English Tripiṭaka volumes are performed under the direction of $the Editorial Committee in Tokyo, Japan. 
Both the Editorial Committee in Tokyo $and the Publication Committee, headquartered in Moraga, California, are ded￾icated to the production of accurate and readable English translations of the $Buddhist canon. 
In doing so, the members of both committees and associated $staff work to honor the deep faith, spirit, and concern of the late Reverend Dr. 
$Yehan Numata, who founded the BDK English Tripiṭaka Series in order to dis￾seminate the Buddhist teachings throughout the world. 
$The long-term goal of our project is the translation and publication of the $texts in the one hundred-volume Taishō edition of the Chinese Buddhist canon, $along with a number of influential extracanonical Japanese Buddhist texts. 
The $list of texts selected for the First Series of this translation project may be found $at the end of each volume in the series. 
$As Chair of the Publication Committee, I am deeply honored to serve as the $fifth person in a post previously held by leading figures in the field of Buddhist $studies, most recently by my predecessor, John R. 
McRae. 
$In conclusion, I wish to thank the members of the Publication Committee for $their dedicated and expert work undertaken in the course of preparing this volume $for publication: Managing Editor Marianne Dresser, Dr.

Volume I $of this translation appeared in 2013; now, after three further years of work, trans￾lation of the remaining three volumes has been accomplished. 
$The general introduction to Volume I by then–Editor-in-Chief Marcus Bingen -$heimer (pp. 
xv–xxviii) provides essential background information on topics $such as the genre of textual collections referred to as Āgamas and Nikāyas; the $Madhyama-āgama in particular; the circumstances in which the Madhyama-$āgama came to be translated from the Indic source language into Chinese in the $fourth century C.E., yielding the text titled Zhong ahan jing (number 26 in the $Taishō edition of the Chinese Tripiṭaka); and, early in the twenty-first century, $the first stage of this project, which will yield a complete English translation of $the Chinese version. 
$This subsidiary introduction to Volume II clarifies certain details regarding $the transition from the first stage of the translation process to this second and $final stage. 
The introduction to Volume III will discuss the Pāli parallels to the $discourses of the Madhyama-āgama, and the introduction to Volume IV the $divisions of the Madhyama-āgama.$Four Volumes, Two $Translation Teams $The collection called Madhyama-āgama comprises two hundred and twenty￾two discourses grouped somewhat irregularly into eighteen divisions. 
The first $seventy-one of these discourses, which make up divisions 1 to 6, are translated $in Volume I (see Vol. 
I, Contents, pp. 
xi–xiii). 
The remaining one hundred and $fifty-one discourses are in Volume II (divisions 7–11), Volume III (divisions $11–14), and Volume IV (divisions 15–18). 
$xv$Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$The translation and editorial work for Volume I was done by a team of eight $people (for details see Vol. 
I, Introduction, p. 
xxv). 
For Volumes II to IV the $work was done by five of the eight translators and editors who worked on the $first volume: Marcus Bingenheimer, William Chu, and Shi Chunyin, along with $Bhikkhu Anālayo and Roderick S. 
Bucknell, who shared the role of overall edi￾tors. 
One of the editors’ main tasks was to check closely all of the draft translations $for accuracy, consistency of terminology, and appropriate style, and to revise $them wherever this was deemed necessary. 
$Although care has been taken to ensure that Volumes II to IV generally main￾tain continuity of terminology and style with Volume I, two exceptions have $been introduced. 
These deserve to be spelled out here, not only to inform readers $but also to illustrate the kinds of difficult decisions that translators of Chinese $Buddhist texts often have to make. 
$The first exception concerns the paired Chinese terms jue and guan. 
These $denote the first two factors of the first meditative absorption (Pāli jhāna) and $correspond to the paired Pāli terms vitakka and vicāra. 
In Volume I jue and guan are translated as “initial and sustained application of the mind,” because that $(or something similar) is how the corresponding Pāli terms are sometimes ren￾dered. 
In Volumes II to IV, however, the terms jué and guān in the same context $are translated as “[directed] awareness and [sustained] contemplation.” We $believe this phrase succeeds in capturing the meanings of the two terms as they $are used elsewhere in the Chinese Madhyama-āgama. 
This change was made $with full recognition that there is sometimes a tension between the twin aims $of producing a faithful rendering of the Chinese text and taking due account of $the underlying Indic text. 
$The issue arises when one is producing an English translation of a Chinese $translation of an Indic original (on such issues see Roderick S. 
Bucknell, “Taking $Account of the Indic Source-text,” in Konrad Meisig ed., Translating Buddhist $Chinese, Problems and Prospects [Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2010], pp. 
45–52). 
$In recognition of the challenges presented by such a process, the editors have $followed the principle that within the framework of overall cooperation, each $takes special care of, and responsibility for, one of these two dimensions of the $translation process. 
Thus, Roderick S. 
Bucknell has given special attention to $the accuracy of the English translation in reflecting the Chinese source-text, $whereas Bhikkhu Anālayo has emphasized discerning the underlying Indic $xvi$Introduction original, as well as providing relevant comparative annotation. 
It is hoped that $as a result of such collaboration, the translation presented here does justice both $to the Chinese text as we now have it and to its no-longer-extant Indic forerunner. 
$The second exception to the translation procedure adopted for Volume I has $to do with the familiar formula that usually appears at the end of each discourse. 
$In Volume I this formula is translated as “Having heard the Buddha’s words, the $monks were delighted and remembered them well,” with the phrase “the monks” $sometimes replaced by some other descriptor, according to the audience specified. 
$In this and the remaining volumes, however, this phrase is translated as “Having $heard what the Buddha said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully” $(again with “the monks” sometimes replaced by other words according to the $audience). 
This difference in wording reflects uncertainty about the meaning of $the Chinese expression fengxing in the given context. 
In Volume I fengxing is $understood as meaning “to remember well”; in Volumes II to IV, on the basis of $the discussion presented by Bhikkhu Anālayo in Madhyama-āgama Studies$(Taipei: Dharma Drum Publishing Corporation, 2012), pp. 
521–525, it is under￾stood as meaning “to receive respectfully.” $Among some more general changes introduced in Volumes II to IV the most $noteworthy relates to the citation of parallel Pāli discourses. 
If a Madhyama-$āgama discourse has a Pāli parallel, then is cited in an endnote attached to the $title of the translated discourse (for Volumes II–IV the sets of endnotes were $compiled by Bhikkhu Anālayo). 
Three pieces of information about the parallel $discourse are given: its Pāli title; its “identifier,” specifying its Nikāya and its $serial number therein; and its volume and page location in the Pali Text Society $(PTS) editions. 
The second of these, the identifier, is a new item not provided $in Volume I. 
It conveys useful information—particularly if the cited discourse $is located in the Saṃyutta-nikāya or the Aṅguttara-nikāya, since in such cases $the serial number serves to identify the saṃyutta or nipāta. 
For example, for $Madhyama-āgama discourse 73, “On Devas,” the Pāli parallel is cited as “AN $8.64,” that is, discourse no. 
64 in the Aṅguttara Book of Eights (Aṭṭhaka-nipāta). 
$The numbering of all Pāli discourses follows the PTS editions, a convention $that is occasionally not followed in recently published English translations.$xvii$THE MADHYAMA ĀGAMA $(MIDDLE-LENGTH DISCOURSES) $VOLUME II

^ck The Discourse on the History of King Long Life Span1$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Kosambī in $Ghosita’s Park. 
$At that time a number of monks from Kosambī were fighting and quarreling $with one another.2$ Then the World-honored One told the monks from Kosambī: $Monks, don’t fight and quarrel! Why is that? $If one [tries] by quarreling to stop quarreling, $In the end one will not see it stop. 
$Only by patience can quarreling be stopped. 
$This is a principle that should be honored. 
$Why is that? In the distant past there was a king of Kosala named Long $Life Span, and there was a king of Kāsi named Brahmadatta. 
These two $kings were constantly quarreling and battling with each other. 
Then King $Brahmadatta of Kāsi assembled his fourfold army—his elephant troops, $cavalry, chariot troops, and infantry. 
Having assembled his fourfold army, $King Brahmadatta of Kāsi personally led his army’s approach, intending $to do battle with King Long Life Span of Kosala. 
$King Long Life Span of Kosala heard, “King Brahmadatta of Kāsi has $assembled his fourfold army—his elephant troops, cavalry, chariot troops, $and infantry—and, having assembled his fourfold army, is coming to do $battle with me.” $Having heard this, King Long Life Span of Kosala also assembled his $fourfold army—his elephant troops, cavalry, chariot troops, and infantry—$and, having assembled his fourfold army, King Long Life Span of Kosala $personally led his army out to the border [between the two countries]. 
He $3$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$had [the army] line up in battle array and did battle, devastating and $destroying [the enemy]. 
$Then King Long Life Span of Kosala captured the entire fourfold army $of King Brahmadatta—his elephant troops, cavalry, chariot troops, and $infantry—and he even captured alive King Brahmadatta of Kāsi himself. 
$Having captured him, he then set him free, saying, “You are a man in dis￾tress. 
I now pardon you. 
Henceforth don’t do this again!” $A second and a third time King Brahmadatta of Kāsi assembled his $fourfold army—his elephant troops, cavalry, chariot troops, and infantry. 
$Having assembled his fourfold army, King Brahmadatta of Kāsi personally $led his army’s approach, to do battle with King Long Life Span of Kosala. 
$King Long Life Span of Kosala heard, “King Brahmadatta of Kāsi has $assembled his fourfold army—his elephant troops, cavalry, chariot troops, $and infantry—and, having assembled his fourfold army, is coming to do $battle with me.” $Having heard this, King Long Life Span of Kosala had this thought, $“I have already conquered [King Brahmadatta]. 
Why do I need to conquer $him again? I have already defeated him. 
Why defeat him further? I have $already harmed him. 
Why do I need to harm him again? Even with just $a bow I could defeat him.” $Having had this thought, King Long Life Span of Kosala remained at $ease and did not again assemble his fourfold army—his elephant troops, $cavalry, chariot troops, and infantry—and did not personally [lead its] $approach. 
Then King Brahmadatta of Kāsi was able to approach and destroy $[the enemy], and he captured the entire fourfold army of King Long Life $Span of Kosala—his elephant troops, cavalry, chariot troops, and infantry. 
$Then King Long Life Span of Kosala heard, “King Brahmadatta of $Kāsi approached and captured my entire fourfold army—my elephant $troops, cavalry, chariot troops, and infantry.” He further had this thought, $“Fighting is very odd! Fighting is very evil! Why is that? Having con￾quered, one will conquer again. 
Having defeated, one will defeat again. 
$Having harmed, one will harm again. 
Let me now rather go to Benares, $accompanied only by my one wife, riding together in one chariot.” There￾upon King Long Life Span of Kosala set out for Benares, accompanied $only by his one wife, riding together in one chariot.3$ $4^taisho533a Division 7$King Long Life Span of Kosala had another thought, “Let me now rather $go from village to village and town to town, to learn through hearing much.” $Having had this thought, King Long Life Span of Kosala went from village $to village and town to town, learning through hearing much. 
Because of $his vast learning, he changed his name to Master Long Life Span. 
$Master Long Life Span further had this thought, “Whatever is to be $learned, I have now already gained. 
Let me go to the city of Benares, stop $in the streets and alleys and, with a cheerful face, perform fine music. 
In $this way the noble families of Benares, on hearing me, will be greatly $delighted and entertained.” $Having had this thought, Master Long Life Span went to the city of $Benares, stopped in the streets and alleys and, with a cheerful face, per￾formed fine music. 
In this way the noble families of Benares, on hearing $him, were greatly delighted and entertained. 
$Then the outer [circle] of the retainers of King Brahmadatta of Kāsi $heard about him, the intermediate [circle], ...
the inner [circle] of retainers, $and the brahmin chaplain (purohita) all heard about him in turn. 
On hearing $about him, the brahmin chaplain summoned him to come and visit. 
Then $Master Long Life Span approached the brahmin chaplain and, standing $before him with a cheerful face, he performed fine music. 
On hearing it, $the brahmin chaplain was greatly delighted and entertained. 
$Then the brahmin chaplain told Master Long Life Span, “From now $on you can live in reliance on me. 
I shall provide for you.” Master Long $Life Span said, “Venerable sir, I have a wife, what about her?” The brahmin $chaplain said in reply, “Master, you can bring her along to stay in my $house in reliance on me. 
I shall provide for her [too].” Then Master Long $Life Span took his wife to the house of the brahmin chaplain to live in $reliance on him, and the brahmin chaplain provided for them.4$At a later time Master Long Life Span’s wife, [who was pregnant,] $experienced in her mind sadness and anxiety, thinking, “I wish that the $fourfold army would parade in battle array, proceeding slowly in due order $with their swords unsheathed. 
I would like to review [the army] and then $be able to drink the water from the [ritual] sharpening of the swords.” $Having had this thought, the wife of Master Long Life Span said to him, $“In my mind I am experiencing sadness and anxiety, and I have the thought: $5^taisho533b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$‘I wish that the fourfold army would parade in battle array, proceeding $slowly in due order with their swords unsheathed. 
I would like to review $[the army] and then be able to drink the water from the sharpening of the $swords.’” $Master Long Life Span told his wife, “My dear, don’t have such $thoughts! Why is that? We have been destroyed by King Brahmadatta. 
$My dear, for what purpose should you wish to see the fourfold army parad￾ing in battle array, proceeding slowly with their swords unsheathed, [and $why should you think]: ‘I would like to review [the army] and then be $able to drink the water from the sharpening of the swords’?” His wife $replied, “Honorable [husband], if I am able to get [that water], I shall live. 
$If I do not get it, I will certainly die, without a doubt.” $Then Master Long Life Span approached the brahmin chaplain and, $standing before him with a sad face, performed music with unpleasant, $subdued sounds. 
On hearing it the brahmin chaplain was not delighted.5$At this the brahmin chaplain asked, “Master, formerly you stood before $me and, with a cheerful face, performed fine music. 
On hearing it I was $greatly delighted and entertained. 
Why do you now stand before me with $a sad face and perform music with unpleasant, subdued sounds, such that $on hearing it I am not delighted? Master Long Life Span, isn’t your body $afflicted by some disease? Isn’t your mind sad and anxious?” $Master Long Life Span replied, “Venerable sir, my body is not afflicted, $but my mind is sad and anxious. 
Venerable sir, my wife is experiencing $in her mind sadness and anxiety, thinking, ‘I wish that the fourfold army $would parade in battle array, proceeding slowly in due order with their $swords unsheathed. 
I would like to review [the army] and then be able to $drink the water from the sharpening of the swords.’ $“I replied to my wife, ‘My dear, don’t have such thoughts! Why is that? $Given our present situation, my dear, for what purpose should you go to $see the fourfold army parading in battle array, proceeding slowly with their $swords unsheathed; [why should you think:] ‘I would like to review [the $army] and then be able to drink the water from the sharpening of the swords?’ $“My wife replied, ‘Honorable [husband], if I am able to get [that water], $I shall live. 
If I do not get it I will certainly die, without a doubt.’ Venerable $sir, if my wife is not completely well, I do not function properly.” $6^taisho533c Division 7$The brahmin chaplain asked, “Master, can I visit your wife?” [Master $Long Life Span] replied, “You can visit her, honorable sir.” $Then the brahmin chaplain, accompanied by Master Long Life Span, $approached the wife. 
$At that time the wife of Master Long Life Span was pregnant with a $virtuous son. 
The brahmin chaplain, seeing that Master Long Life Span’s $wife was pregnant with a virtuous son, knelt down with his right knee on $the floor, extended his hands with his palms joined toward the wife of $Master Long Life Span, and said three times, “A king of Kosala will be $born, a king of Kosala will be born!” He ordered his servants, “Let no $one know this!” $The brahmin chaplain said, “Master, don’t be sad or anxious. 
I can $ensure that your wife gets to see the fourfold army parading in battle array, $proceeding slowly in due order with their swords unsheathed, and then $she will be able to drink the water from the sharpening of the swords.” $Then the brahmin chaplain went to King Brahmadatta of Kāsi. 
On $arriving he said, “Your Majesty should know: an auspicious star has $appeared. 
May Your Majesty order the fourfold army to parade in battle $array, proceeding slowly in due order with their swords unsheathed, to $show off the might of the army as they perform the [ritual] sharpening of $the swords in water. 
May Your Majesty himself go out to observe it. 
Your $Majesty, doing this will certainly be auspicious.” $Then King Brahmadatta of Kāsi ordered the army chief, “Officer, you $should know: an auspicious star has appeared. 
Officer, quickly order the $fourfold army to parade in battle array, proceeding slowly in due order $with their swords unsheathed, to show off the might of the army as they $perform the sharpening of the swords in water. 
I myself will go out to $observe it. 
Doing this will certainly be auspicious.” $Then the army chief, on receiving this order from the king, ordered $the fourfold army to parade in battle array, proceeding slowly in due order $with their swords unsheathed, to show off the might of the army as they $performed the sharpening of the swords in water. 
[King] Brahmadatta $himself went out to observe it. 
$As a result, the wife of Master Long Life Span got to see the fourfold $army parading in battle array, proceeding slowly in due order with their $7^taisho534a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$swords unsheathed, showing off the might of the army. 
She was also able $to drink the water from the sharpening of the swords. 
Once she had drunk $the water from the sharpening of the swords, her sadness and anxiety dis￾appeared and she soon gave birth to a virtuous son. 
When he was named $he was called Prince Long Life. 
He was entrusted to [other] people to $raise him secretly and gradually grew up to adulthood. 
$Like any anointed warrior king who governs in the world on having $acquired a large territory, Prince Long Life [learned] various types of $skills, such as riding elephants and riding horses, taming and controlling $them, galloping, shooting for sport, boxing, casting nets and casting hooks, $riding chariots, and riding in carriages. 
He mastered all the various fine $skills in this way and triumphed in various types of subtle contests. 
He $was unrivaled in the world in his determined resolution and outstanding $in his intelligence. 
[Although he remained] well concealed and disguised, $there was nothing that he did not fully master.6$Then [King] Brahmadatta heard that King Long Life Span of Kosala $had changed his name, becoming a “master,” and was staying in the city $of Benares.7$ [King] Brahmadatta ordered his officers, “Officers, go quickly $and seize King Long Life Span of Kosala, bind his hands behind him, put $him on a donkey, and beat a broken drum that makes a sound like a don￾key’s braying. 
Having announced this order widely, lead him out through $the southern gate, have him sit beneath a tall signpost, and interrogate $him closely.” $Having received this order, the officers promptly went and seized King $Long Life Span of Kosala, bound his hands behind him, put him on a don￾key and, beating a broken drum that made a sound like a donkey’s braying, $they announced the order widely and led him out through the southern $gate. 
Seating him beneath a tall signpost, they interrogated him closely.8$At that time Prince Long Life followed his father, staying behind him $or to his left or right. 
He said to his father, “Your Majesty, don’t be afraid! $Your Majesty, don’t be afraid! I am here. 
I will certainly be able to rescue $you. 
I will certainly be able to rescue you.” $King Long Life Span of Kosala replied, “Be patient, Prince! Be patient, $Prince! Don’t let the bondage of resentment arise. 
Instead you should $practice loving-kindness.” $8$Division 7$The people heard King Long Life Span speaking these words and asked $the king, “What are you talking about?” $The king replied to the people, “This prince is intelligent; he will cer￾tainly understand my words.” $Then Prince Long Life appealed to the noble families of the city of Benares, $“Noble sirs, make merit by practicing generosity and dedicate it to King $Long Life Span of Kosala: ‘Through the merit of this generosity, may King $Long Life Span of Kosala be well and at ease! May he be set free!’” $Then the noble families of the city of Benares, on being appealed to by $Prince Long Life, made merit by practicing generosity and dedicated it to $King Long Life Span of Kosala: “Through the merit of this generosity, may $King Long Life Span of Kosala be well and at ease! May he be set free!” $King Brahmadatta of Kāsi heard that the noble families of Benares $were making merit by practicing generosity and dedicating it to King $Long Life Span of Kosala, saying, “Through the merit of this generosity, $may King Long Life Span of Kosala be well and at ease! May he be set $free!” On hearing this he became very fearful and all the hairs on his body $stood on end. 
[He said,] “Isn’t this causing these noble families of the city $of Benares to rebel against me? Just let me settle this issue! Let me now, $first of all, swiftly put an end to this issue!” $Then King Brahmadatta of Kāsi ordered his servants, “Quickly go and $kill King Long Life Span of Kosala! Cut him into seven pieces!” Having $received this order, the servants quickly went and killed King Long Life $Span of Kosala and cut him into seven pieces. 
$Then Prince Long Life appealed to the noble families of the city of $Benares, “Noble sirs, look at this! King Brahmadatta of Kāsi is cruel and $immoral. 
He captured my father, King Long Life Span of Kosala, an inno￾cent man; he seized his country and the wealth in his storehouses; he bru￾tally and unjustly had him killed and cut into seven pieces. 
Come, noble $sirs. 
With new silk cloth bring together [the remains of] my father. 
Anoint $the seven pieces of the corpse all over with fragrance. 
Collect fragrant $wood, cremate him, and install [the ashes] in a shrine. 
$“Deliver this message to [King] Brahmadatta on my behalf: ‘Prince $Long Life of Kosala says this, “Do you not fear that the descendants [of $King Long Life Span] will later give you trouble?”’” $9^taisho534b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Then, urged on by Prince Long Life, the noble families of the city of $Benares brought together the [king’s] remains using new silk cloth, taking $the seven pieces of his corpse and anointing them all over with fragrance. 
$They collected fragrant wood, cremated him, and installed [the ashes] in $a shrine.9$Then they delivered this message to [King] Brahmadatta: “Prince Long $Life of Kosala says this, ‘Do you not fear that the descendants [of King $Long Life Span] will later give you trouble?’” $Then the [bereaved] wife of King Long Life Span said to Prince Long $Life, “You should know that King Brahmadatta of Kāsi is cruel and $immoral. 
He captured your father, King Long Life Span of Kosala, an $innocent man; he seized his country and the wealth in his storehouses; he $brutally and unjustly had him killed and cut into seven pieces. 
Come, $Prince. 
Let us leave Benares, riding together in one chariot. 
If you do not $leave you will meet with disaster.” $Then the wife of King Long Life Span and Prince Long Life left Benares, $riding together in one chariot. 
At that time Prince Long Life had this thought, $“Let me now rather go from village to village and town to town, to learn $through hearing much.” Having had this thought, Prince Long Life went $from village to village and town to town, learning through hearing much. 
$Because of his wide learning he changed his name to Master Long Life. 
$Master Long Life further thought, “What is to be learned I have now $already attained. 
Let me return to the city of Benares, stop in the streets $and alleys and, with a cheerful face, perform fine music. 
In this way the $noble families of Benares, on hearing me, will be greatly delighted and $entertained.” $Having had this thought, Master Long Life went to the city of Benares, $stopped in the streets and alleys and, with a cheerful face, performed fine $music. 
In this way the noble families of Benares, on hearing him, were $greatly delighted and entertained. 
$Then the outer [circle] of the retainers of King Brahmadatta of Kāsi $heard about him, the intermediate [circle] of retainers, ...
the inner [circle] $of retainers, and the brahmin chaplain all heard about him in turn; and so $too did King Brahmadatta of Kāsi, who summoned him to come and $visit.10$10^taisho534c Division 7$Master Long Life approached King Brahmadatta of Kāsi and, standing $before him with a cheerful face, performed fine music. 
On hearing it, King $Brahmadatta of Kāsi was greatly delighted and entertained. 
$Then King Brahmadatta of Kāsi told him, “Master, from now on you $can live in reliance on me; I shall provide for you.” Then Master Long $Life went to live in reliance on King Brahmadatta of Kāsi, who provided $for him. 
$Later on [the king] gained trust in Master Long Life and, by means of $assigning him one responsibility, he handed him the sword [signifying $the office] of bodyguard. 
$At that time King Brahmadatta of Kāsi ordered his charioteer, “Prepare $the chariot, I wish to go out hunting.” On receiving this order, the charioteer $promptly prepared the chariot. 
When it was ready, he returned and said, $“The chariot is prepared and at Your Majesty’s disposal.” $Then King Brahmadatta of Kāsi, together with Master Long Life, went $out [of Benares], riding in the chariot. 
Master Long Life had this thought, $“This King Brahmadatta of Kāsi is cruel and immoral. 
He captured my $father, King Long Life Span of Kosala, an innocent man; he seized his $country and the wealth in his storehouses; he brutally and unjustly had $him killed and cut into seven pieces. 
Let me now drive the chariot in such $a way that it becomes separated from the fourfold army, each being in a $different place.” Having had this thought, Master Long Life steered the $chariot so that it became separated from the fourfold army, each being in $a different place. 
$At this time King Brahmadatta of Kāsi, having encountered a muddy $stretch of road and being oppressed by a hot wind, was feeling distressed $and thirsty. 
Tired and wishing to lie down, he descended from the chariot $and, using Master Long Life’s knee as a pillow, took a nap. 
$Then Master Long Life again had this thought, “King Brahmadatta of $Kāsi is cruel and immoral. 
He captured my father, an innocent man; he $seized his country and the wealth in his storehouses; he brutally and $unjustly had him killed and cut into seven pieces. 
Right now he is in my $hands. 
I should just take revenge.” $Having had this thought, Master Long Life took out his sharp knife, $held it at the throat of King Brahmadatta of Kāsi, and said, “Now I will $11^taisho535a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$kill you. 
Now I will kill you.” Then Master Long Life thought again, “For $me to [kill him] would be wrong. 
Why is that? I recall how my father, $long ago, when he was seated beneath the signpost, on the verge of death, $told me, ‘Be patient, Prince! Be patient, Prince! Don’t let the bondage of $resentment arise. 
Instead you should practice loving-kindness.’” Recalling $this, [Master Long Life] withdrew the knife and put it back in its sheath. 
$At that time King Brahmadatta of Kāsi was having a dream in which $he saw this, “Prince Long Life, the son of King Long Life Span of Kosala, $is holding a sharp knife at my throat, saying, ‘Now I will kill you. 
Now I $will kill you.’” On seeing this he became very fearful and all the hairs on $his body stood on end. 
He was so startled that he woke up. 
Arising, he said $to Master Long Life, “You should know that in my dream I saw Prince $Long Life, the son of King Long Life Span of Kosala, holding a sharp $knife at my throat and saying, ‘Now I will kill you, now I will kill you.’” $On hearing this, Master Long Life said, “Let your Majesty, not be $afraid! Let your Majesty not be afraid! Why is that? That Prince Long $Life, the son of King Long Life Span of Kosala, is myself.11 Your Majesty, $I had this thought: ‘King Brahmadatta of Kāsi is cruel and immoral. 
He $captured my father, an innocent man; he seized his country and the wealth $in his storehouses; he brutally and unjustly had him killed and cut into $seven pieces. 
Right now he is in my hands. 
I should just take revenge.’ $“Your Majesty, I took out my sharp knife, held it at your throat, and $said, ‘Now I will kill you. 
Now I will kill you.’ Your Majesty, I thought $again, ‘For me to [kill him] would be wrong. 
Why is that? I recall how $my father, long ago, when he was seated beneath the signpost, on the $verge of death, told me, “Be patient, Prince! Be patient, Prince! Don’t let $the bondage of resentment arise. 
Instead you should practice loving-kind￾ness.”’ On recalling this, I withdrew the knife and put it back in its sheath.” $King Brahmadatta of Kāsi said, “Prince, you said this, ‘Be patient, $Prince! Be patient, Prince!’—I understand the meaning of this. 
[But,] $Prince, you also said, ‘Don’t let the bondage of resentment arise. 
Instead $you should practice loving-kindness’—what is the meaning of this?” $Prince Long Life replied, “Your Majesty, ‘Don’t let the bondage of $resentment arise. 
Instead you should practice loving-kindness’ means just $this, [what I am doing right now].” $12$Division 7$On hearing this, King Brahmadatta of Kāsi said, “Prince, as of now $the entire country controlled by me is given to you, and your father’s orig￾inal country is returned to you. 
Why is that? What you have done—namely, $sparing my life—is extremely difficult to do.” $On hearing this, Prince Long Life said, “Your Majesty’s original country $belongs to Your Majesty. 
My father’s original country can be regarded as $having been returned [to me].”12$Then King Brahmadatta of Kāsi returned in the chariot together with $Prince Long Life. 
He entered the city of Benares, sat in the main hall, and $addressed his ministers, “Ministers, if you were to see Prince Long Life, $the son of King Long Life Span of Kosala, what would you do?” $On hearing this, some of the ministers said, “Your Majesty, if I were to $see him I would cut off his hands.” Others said, “Your Majesty, if I were $to see him I would cut off his feet.” Still others said, “I would kill him.” $King Brahmadatta of Kāsi told his ministers, “Ministers, if you wish $to see Prince Long Life, the son of King Long Life Span of Kosala, here $he is. 
Do not give rise to any evil intention toward this prince! Why is $that? What this prince has done—namely, sparing my life—is extremely $difficult to do.” $Then King Brahmadatta of Kāsi had Prince Long Life bathed royally, $anointed with royal fragrances, dressed in royal garments, and seated on $a golden throne. 
Then he gave his daughter to him in marriage and let $him return to his own country. 
$Monks, all those monarchs, anointed warrior kings, were rulers of great $countries. 
In governing their countries they themselves practiced patience $in the face of insult and also spoke in praise of patience; they themselves $practiced loving-kindness and also spoke in praise of loving-kindness; they $themselves practiced benevolence and also spoke in praise of benevolence. 
$Monks, you too should be like that. 
Having left home out of faith and $gone forth to practice the path, you should practice patience in the face $of insult and also speak in praise of patience; yourselves practice loving￾kindness and also speak in praise of loving-kindness; yourselves practice $benevolence and also speak in praise of benevolence. 
$At this, some of the monks [at Kosambī] who heard what the Buddha said $gave this reply, “The World-honored One is the master of the Dharma [but] $13^taisho535b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$let him now, for the time being, stop [intervening]. 
Those [of the other faction] $are telling us what to do. 
Do we not [also] get to tell them what to do?”13$Then the World-honored One was not pleased with the behavior of the $monks of Kosambī, with their manners, with their training, or with their prac￾tice. 
He rose from his seat and spoke these verses: $With a few spoken words $They tear apart the most revered sangha. 
$When the noble sangha is torn apart, $No one can reprove and stop them. 
$[The king of Kāsi] killed [the king of Kosala] by cutting up his body; $Seized his elephants, cattle, horses, and property; $Destroyed his country, wiped him out completely. 
$[Yet,] as in ancient times, he achieved reconciliation. 
$You, however, on account of a small verbal abuse, $Are unable to exercise restraint and be in harmony. 
$If you do not consider what is really significant, $How can the bondage of resentment become appeased? $With much verbal abuse, scolding, and blaming, $One can [still] exercise restraint and be in harmony. 
$If one considers what is really significant, $The bondage of resentment can certainly be appeased. 
$If one [tries] to end quarreling by quarreling, $One will never see it end. 
$Only through patience can one end quarreling.

$When the World-honored One had spoken these verses, he departed, trav￾eling through the air by means of his supernormal power, and he arrived in $the village of Bālakaloṇakāra.15 At that time Venerable Bhagu, a son of the $Sakyans, was in the village of Bālakaloṇakāra. 
Day and night he was not $sleepy; he energetically practiced the path, dwelling with the aspiration to $be continuously concentrated and established in the requisites of the path.16$Venerable [Bhagu], a son of the Sakyans, saw the Buddha coming in the $distance. 
On seeing him, [Bhagu] approached to receive him. 
He took the $Buddha’s [outer] robe and bowl and set out a seat for the Buddha and water $to wash his feet. 
The Buddha, having washed his feet, sat down on the seat $[prepared] by Venerable Bhagu, a son of the Sakyans. 
Having sat down, he $said, “Monk Bhagu, are you constantly at ease, lacking nothing?” $Venerable Bhagu, son of the Sakyans, replied, “World-honored One, I am $constantly at ease, lacking nothing.” $15$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$The World-honored One asked again, “Monk Bhagu, in what way are you $at ease, lacking nothing?” $Venerable Bhagu replied, “World-honored One, day and night I am not $sleepy; I energetically practice the path, dwelling with the aspiration to be $continuously concentrated and established in the requisites of the path. 
World￾honored One, in this way I am constantly at ease, lacking nothing.”17$The World-honored One thought, “This clansman is dwelling at ease. 
Let $me now teach him the Dharma.” Having had this thought, he taught the Dharma $to Venerable Bhagu, exhorting and inspiring him, fully delighting him. 
Having $taught him the Dharma with countless skillful means, having exhorted and $inspired him, fully delighting him, [the Buddha] rose from his seat and left, $heading for Rakkhitavana Grove.18 Entering Rakkhitavana Grove, he went to $the base of a tree, spread his sitting mat, and sat down cross-legged. 
$The World-honored One further thought, “I have been able to get away $from those Kosambī monks with their frequent disputes, their mutual antag￾onism, hatred, and anger, their quarrelling among themselves. 
I do not delight $in recalling that region, the place where those Kosambī monks dwell.” $Just at that time there was a single great elephant, the leader of a herd of $elephants, who had left his herd and, wandering alone, had come to Rakkhi￾tavana Grove. 
Entering Rakkhitavana Grove, he went to an excellent sāla tree and stood leaning against that excellent sāla tree. 
$Then the great elephant had this thought, “I have been able to get away $from that herd of elephants—female elephants, male elephants, elephant $calves big and small. 
That herd of elephants was always walking ahead of $me, trampling the grass and muddying the water. 
At that time I had to eat $trampled grass and drink muddied water. 
Now I can feed on fresh grass and $clear water.” $Then the World-honored One, by means of the knowledge of the minds of $others, came to know the thoughts in the mind of that elephant. 
He spoke $these verses: $One elephant is like [other] elephants, $With body complete and endowed with tusks. 
$One’s mind too is like [other] minds, $If one delights in dwelling alone in the forest. 
$16^taisho536a Division 7$Then the World-honored One took his robes and bowl and went from $Rakkhita vana Grove to Pācīnavaṃsa Grove. 
At that time there were three $clansmen living together in Pācīnavaṃsa Grove: Venerable Anuruddha, Ven￾erable Nandiya, and Venerable Kimbila. 
Those venerable ones were practicing $in this way.19$Whichever of them came back first from begging for almsfood would set $out the seats, draw water, and put out the utensils for washing the feet: the $foot mat, the cloth for wiping the feet, the water pot, and the bathing bowl. 
$If he was able to finish the food he had received, he would finish it, but if $there were leftovers he would put them in a container and cover it. 
Having $completed his meal, he would put away his bowl, wash his hands and feet, $and, with his sitting mat over his shoulder, go into a hut to sit in meditation. 
$Whichever of them came back last from begging for almsfood would eat $all of the food if he was able to, and if it was not sufficient he would take $from the food previously left over and eat until he had had enough. 
If there $were still leftovers, he would empty them out on the bare ground or into $water that contained no living beings. 
$He would take the eating utensils and, having washed them clean and $wiped them, would put them away to one side. 
He would gather and roll up $the sitting mats and put away the utensils for washing the feet, collecting the $foot mat, the cloth for wiping the feet, the water pot, and the bathing bowl. 
$After having swept the dining hall and sprinkled it [with water], so that it $was clean and free of refuse, he would put away his robe and bowl, wash his $hands and feet and, with his sitting mat over his shoulder, go into a hut to sit $in meditation.20$In the afternoon, if the first of these venerable ones to rise from sitting in $meditation saw that the water pot or the bathing bowl was empty of water, $he would take it and go to fetch [water]. 
If he was able to, he would carry it $back and place it to one side. 
$If he was not able to [carry the full water pot], he would beckon with his $hand to another monk, and the two would carry it together and place it to $one side, without speaking to each other, without asking each other anything. 
$Once in five days these venerable ones would assemble to discuss Dharma $together or to maintain noble silence. 
$17^taisho536b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Then the park warden [of Pācīnavaṃsa Grove], who had seen the World￾honored One coming in the distance, stopped him, saying, “Renunciant, $renunciant, do not enter this park. 
Why is that? In this park there are three $clansmen, Venerable Anuruddha, Venerable Nandiya, and Venerable Kimbila. 
$If they were to see you they might disapprove.” $The World-honored One said, “Park warden, if they were to see me they $would certainly approve. 
They would not disapprove.”21$Then Venerable Anuruddha, who had seen the World-honored One coming $in the distance, reprimanded the park warden, saying, “Don’t refuse the $World-honored One, park warden! Don’t stop the Well-gone One! Why is $that? This is our venerable [teacher] who is coming; it is our Well-gone One $who is coming.” $Venerable Anuruddha came out to receive the World-honored One. 
He $took the Buddha’s [outer] robe and bowl, Venerable Nandiya set out a seat $for the Buddha, and Venerable Kimbila brought water for the Buddha. 
$At that time the Buddha, having washed his hands and feet, sat down on $the seat set out by that venerable one. 
Having sat down, he asked, “Anuruddha, $are you constantly at ease, lacking nothing?” $Venerable Anuruddha replied, “World-honored One, I am constantly at $ease, lacking nothing.” $The World-honored One asked, “Anuruddha, in what way are you con￾stantly at ease, lacking nothing?” $Venerable Anuruddha replied: $World-honored One, I have this thought, “It is a great gain for me, it is a $great benefit for me, that I am practicing together with such companions $in the holy life.” World-honored One, toward these companions in the $holy life I constantly practice bodily deeds of loving-kindness, both seen $and unseen, equally and without distinction; I practice verbal deeds of $loving-kindness and mental deeds of loving kindness, both seen and $unseen, equally and without distinction. 
$World-honored One, I have this thought, “Let me now forgo my own $state of mind and follow the state of mind of these venerable friends.” $Then, World-honored One, I forgo my own state of mind and follow the $state of mind of these venerable friends. 
World-honored One, I never have $18$Division 7$even one disapproving state of mind. 
World-honored One, it is in this way $that I am constantly at ease, lacking nothing. 
$[The Buddha] asked Venerable Nandiya [the same questions and received] $similar answers. 
Then [the Buddha] also asked Venerable Kimbila, “Are you $constantly at ease, lacking nothing?” $Venerable Kimbila replied, “World-honored One, I am constantly at ease, $lacking nothing.” $[The Buddha] asked, “Kimbila, in what way are you constantly at ease, $lacking nothing?” $Venerable Kimbila replied: $World-honored One, I have this thought, “It is a great gain for me, it is a $great benefit for me, that I am practicing together with such companions $in the holy life.” World-honored One, toward these companions in the $holy life I constantly practice bodily deeds of loving-kindness, both seen $and unseen, equally and without distinction; I practice verbal deeds of $loving-kindness and mental deeds of loving kindness, both seen and $unseen, equally and without distinction.

$The World-honored One praised them: $It is well, it is well, Anuruddha! In this way you are constantly together $in harmony, at ease and without contention, of a single mind, of a single $teacher, blending [like] water and milk. 
Do you [also] attain a superhuman $state, a distinction, a peaceful abiding in tranquility? $Venerable Anuruddha replied: $World-honored One, in this way being constantly together in harmony, at $ease and without contention, of a single mind, of a single teacher, blending $19^taisho536c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$[like] water and milk, we do attain a superhuman state, a state of distinction, $a peaceful abiding in tranquility.

^ck The Discourse $on Devas31$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was dwelling in Sandbank Forest $in Ceti country. 
$At that time, the World-honored One told the monks: $At a former time, when I had not yet attained realization of the unsurpassable, $right, and true awakening, I had this thought, “I would rather give rise $[inwardly] to bright light and, because of that bright light, see forms.32 In $this way my knowledge and vision will become supremely bright and pure.” $In order that my knowledge and vision became supremely bright and $pure, I went to stay in a remote and solitary place, where I practiced dili￾gently with a mind free of indolence.

^ck The Discourse on $Eight Thoughts36$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was dwelling in the Deer Park in $Bhesakaḷa Forest on Suṃsumāra Mountain in Bhagga country. 
$At that time, Venerable Anuruddha was dwelling in Sandbank Forest in the $Ceti country. 
At that time Venerable Anuruddha was seated in meditation in a $quiet place, reflecting. 
He had these [seven] thoughts in his mind: $The path is attained through having no desires, not through having desires. 
$The path is attained through contentment, not through dissatisfaction. 
The $path is attained through seclusion, not through rejoicing in company, $dwelling in company, being together with [others in] company. 
The path $is attained through effort, not through indolence. 
The path is attained $through right mindfulness, not through wrong mindfulness. 
The path is $attained through a concentrated mind, not through a distracted mind. 
The $path is attained through wisdom, not through delusion. 
$Then, through the [supernormal] knowledge of the minds of others the $World-honored One came to know the thoughts, reflections, and activities $in the mind of Venerable Anuruddha. 
Having come to know this, the World￾honored One entered an appropriate state of concentration. 
Through this $appropriate state of concentration, just as [swiftly and easily] as a strong man $could bend and stretch out his arm, in the same way the World-honored One $disappeared from the Deer Park in Bhesakaḷa Forest on Suṃsumāra Mountain $in Bhagga country and appeared before Venerable Anuruddha in Sandbank $Forest in Ceti country. 
$37^taisho541a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Then the World-honored One emerged from [the state of] concentration $and praised Venerable Anuruddha: $It is well, it is well, Anuruddha that, while seated in meditation in a quiet $place, reflecting, you had these [seven] thoughts: “The path is attained $through having no desires, not through having desires. 
The path is attained $through contentment, not through dissatisfaction. 
The path is attained $through seclusion, not through rejoicing in company, dwelling in company, $being together with [others in] company. 
The path is attained through $effort, not through indolence. 
The path is attained through right mindful￾ness, not through wrong mindfulness. 
The path is attained through a con￾centrated mind, not through a distracted mind. 
The path is attained through $wisdom, not through delusion.” $Anuruddha, you shall receive from the Tathāgata an eighth thought of $a great person. 
Having received it, reflect on it! “The path is attained $through absence of proliferation, delighting in absence of proliferation, $and practicing absence of proliferation; not through proliferation, not $through delighting in proliferation, not through practicing proliferation.” $Anuruddha, if you become accomplished in these eight thoughts of a $great person, you will certainly be able to attain [the four absorptions]: $“Secluded from sensual desires, secluded from evil and unwholesome $states, ...
up to ...
dwell having attained the fourth absorption.” $Anuruddha, if you become accomplished in the eight thoughts of a $great person and also attain these four higher states of mind, happy abidings $in the present, attaining them easily and without difficulty, then this will $be for you like being a king or a royal minister who has a fine chest full $of various types of clothes: whatever he desires to wear in the morning, $he takes and puts on; whatever clothes he desires to wear at noon or in $the afternoon he takes and puts on, freely according to his wish. 
$Anuruddha, you will be like this, in that the rag robes you receive will $be for you the best of garments and your mind will be without desires as $you practice this, established in the practice of tranquility. 
$Anuruddha, if you become accomplished in the eight thoughts of a great $person and also attain these four higher states of mind, happy abidings in $the present, attaining them easily and without difficulty, then this will be $38$Division 7$for you like being a king or a royal minister who has a good chief cook $[who prepares] various types of pure, fine, and delectable dishes and meals. 
$Anuruddha, you will be like this, in that the almsfood for which you $regularly beg will be for you the best of meals and your mind will be with￾out desires, as you practice this, established in the practice of tranquility. 
$Anuruddha, if you become accomplished in the eight thoughts of a $great person and also attain these four higher states of mind, happy abidings $in the present, attaining them easily and without difficulty, then this will $be for you like being a king or a royal minister who has a fine house or a $multistoried palace. 
$Anuruddha, you will be like this, in that the tree beneath which you $stay will be for you the best of houses and your mind will be without $desires, as you practice this, established in the practice of tranquility. 
$Anuruddha, if you become accomplished in the eight thoughts of a $great person and also attain these four higher states of mind, happy abidings $in the present, attaining them easily and without difficulty, then this will $be for you like being a king or a royal minister who has fine couches and $seats, upholstered with woolen textiles, draped with brocades and fine $silk fabric, with lined and quilted coverlets, and with cushions [made of] $antelope hide at both ends. 
$Anuruddha, you will be like this, in that a seat of grass or a seat of $leaves will be for you the best of seats and your mind will be without $desires, as you practice this, established in the practice of tranquility. 
$Anuruddha, if you become accomplished in the eight thoughts of a $great person and also attain these four higher states of mind, happy abidings $in the present, attaining them easily and without difficulty, then, if you $wander like this in the eastern direction, you will certainly be at ease, free $of affliction by the multitude of sufferings. 
If you wander in the southern $direction, ...
the western direction, ...
the northern direction you will $certainly be at ease, free of affliction by the multitude of sufferings.37$Anuruddha, if you become accomplished in the eight thoughts of a $great person and also attain these four higher states of mind, happy abidings $in the present, attaining them easily and without difficulty, then I do not $say that you will [merely] maintain wholesome states, let alone do I say $39^taisho541b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$that you will regress; rather you will, by day and by night, increase in $wholesome states and not regress. 
$Anuruddha, if you become accomplished in the eight thoughts of a great $person and also attain these four higher states of mind, happy abidings in $the present, attaining them easily and without difficulty, then you will cer￾tainly attain one of two fruits: either you will attain final knowledge here $and now or, if there is a remainder [of clinging], you will attain nonreturning. 
$Anuruddha, you should become accomplished in these eight thoughts of a $great person and you should attain these four higher states of mind, happy $abidings in the present, attaining them easily and without difficulty. 
After $that, spend the rains retreat in this Sandbank Forest in Ceti country. 
$Then the World-honored One taught the Dharma to Venerable Anuruddha, $exhorting and inspiring him, fully delighting him. 
Having with countless $skillful means taught Anuruddha the Dharma, having exhorted and inspired $him, fully delighting him, [the Buddha] entered an appropriate state of con￾centration. 
Through this appropriate state of concentration, just as [easily $and swiftly as] a strong man could bend and stretch out his arm, the World￾honored One disappeared from Sandbank Forest in Ceti country and appeared $in the Deer Park in Bhesakaḷa Forest on Suṃsumāra Mountain in Bhagga $country. 
$Then Venerable Ānanda, holding a flywhisk, attended the Buddha. 
Then $the World-honored, having emerged from being in [a state of] concentration, $looked around and said, “Ānanda, whatever monks are in the vicinity of the $Deer Park in Bhesakaḷa Forest on Suṃsumāra Mountain, have them all gather $in the assembly hall. 
When they are gathered in the assembly hall, come back $and tell me.” $Having received this instruction from the Buddha, Venerable Ānanda paid $homage at [the Buddha’s] feet and went to announce the order that all monks $in the vicinity of the Deer Park in Bhesakaḷa Forest on Suṃsumāra Mountain $should all gather in the assembly hall. 
When they were gathered in the assem￾bly hall, he went back to the Buddha, paid homage at his feet and, standing $back to one side, said, “World-honored One, all the monks in the vicinity of $the Deer Park in Bhesakaḷa Forest on Suṃsumāra Mountain are all now gath￾ered in the assembly hall. 
May the World-honored One himself know the $proper time.” $40^taisho541c Division 7$Then the World-honored One went to the assembly hall, accompanied by $Venerable Ānanda. 
He spread his sitting mat in front of the assembly of monks $and sat down. 
Having sat down, he said,38 “Monks, I will now teach you the $eight thoughts of a great person. 
Listen closely and pay proper attention!” $Then the monks listened to receive the teaching. 
$The Buddha said: $The eight thoughts of a great person are these: “The path is attained through $having no desires, not through having desires. 
The path is attained through $contentment, not through dissatisfaction. 
The path is attained through $seclusion, not through rejoicing in company, dwelling in company, being $together with [others in] company. 
The path is attained through effort, not $through indolence. 
The path is attained through right mindfulness, not $through wrong mindfulness. 
The path is attained through a concentrated $mind, not through a distracted mind. 
The path is attained through wisdom, $not through delusion. 
The path is attained through absence of proliferation, $delighting in absence of proliferation, and practicing absence of prolifer￾ation, not through proliferation, not through delighting in proliferation, $not through practicing proliferation.” $How is the path attained through having no desires, not through having $desires? This means that when a monk has attained absence of desires, he $himself knows that he has attained absence of desires but he does not let others $know, “I am without desires.” When he has attained contentment, ...
has $attained effort, ...
has attained right mindfulness, ...
has attained right $concentration, ...
has attained wisdom, ...
and has attained absence of $proliferation, he himself knows that he has attained absence of proliferation $and desires but he does not desire to let others know, “I have attained the $absence of [proliferation and] desires.” This is how the path is attained $through having no desires, not through having desires. 
$How is the path attained through contentment, not through dissatis￾faction? This means that a monk practices contentment by taking robes $[only] to cover his physical frame and taking [only enough] food to fulfill $[the needs] of the body.39 This is how the path is attained through con￾tentment, not through dissatisfaction. 
$How is the path attained through seclusion, not through rejoicing in $company, dwelling in company, being together with [others in] company? $41$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$This means that a monk practices seclusion by accomplishing the twofold $seclusion, bodily and mental seclusion.40 This is how the path is attained $through seclusion, not through rejoicing in company, dwelling in company, $being together with [others in] company. 
$How is the path attained through effort, not through indolence? This $means that a monk constantly practices with effort to abandon evil and $unwholesome [states] and develop wholesome states, persistently arousing $his mind, singlemindedly and steadfastly, without abandoning the task, $for the sake of [developing] the roots of wholesomeness. 
This is how the $path is attained through effort, not through indolence. 
$How is the path attained through right mindfulness, not through wrong $mindfulness? This means that a monk contemplates the body as a body $internally, contemplates feelings, ...
states of mind, ...
and dharmas as $dharmas internally.41 This is how the path is attained through right mind￾fulness, not through wrong mindfulness. 
$How is the path attained through a concentrated mind, not through a $distracted mind? This means that a monk dwells secluded from sensual $desires, secluded from evil and unwholesome states, ...

dwells $having attained the fourth absorption. 
This is how the path is attained $through a concentrated mind, not through a distracted mind. 
$How is the path attained through wisdom, not through delusion? This $means that a monk dwells in developing wisdom, contemplating the rise and $fall of dharmas, attaining knowledge like this, noble wisdom that is brightly $penetrating, discriminative understanding, for the true cessation of dukkha.$This is how the path is attained through wisdom, not through delusion. 
$How is the path attained through absence of proliferation, delighting $in absence of proliferation, and practicing absence of proliferation, not $through proliferation, not through delighting in proliferation, not through $practicing proliferation? This means that a monk’s mind constantly extin￾guishes proliferation and enjoys abiding in nirvana without remainder.42$His mind continuously delights in this abiding, rejoicing in mental freedom. 
$This is how the path is attained through absence of proliferation, delighting $in absence of proliferation, and practicing absence of proliferation, not $through proliferation, not through delighting in proliferation, not through $practicing proliferation. 
$42^taisho542a Division 7$Monks, the monk Anuruddha is already accomplished in these eight $thoughts of a great person. 
Later he will spend the rains retreat in Sandbank $Forest in Ceti country, having received this teaching from me. 
$[Anuruddha] stayed in a remote and solitary place and practiced diligently, $with a mind free of indolence. 
Having stayed in a remote and solitary place $and practiced diligently, with a mind free of indolence, [Anuruddha] completed $the supreme holy life, for the sake of which clansmen shave off hair and $beard, don the yellow robe, leave home out of faith, and go forth to practice $the path and fully attain the summit of the holy life. 
In this very life, he per￾sonally attained understanding and awakening, and dwelled having personally $realized it. 
He knew as it really is: “Birth has been ended, the holy life has $been established, what had to be done has been done. 
There will not be $another experiencing of existence.” $Then Venerable Anuruddha became an arahant, his mind was rightly lib￾erated, and he became a supreme elder. 
At that time he spoke these verses: $Knowing from afar my reflections, $The Supreme Teacher of the world, $With his body upright, his mind entered concentration, $Traversing space, he immediately arrived.43$He taught me regarding the [seven] thoughts in my mind $And then added a further one: $That all buddhas delight in absence of proliferation, $Being far removed from any proliferation. 
$Having come to know the Dharma from him, $Being happily established in the true Dharma, $I attained concentration and penetrative wisdom: $“What was to be done in the Buddha’s teaching has been done.”44$I do not delight in death $And I do not wish for rebirth. 
$In accordance with the proper time, $Established in right mindfulness and right comprehension, $43$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$In a bamboo grove at Vesālī $My life will come to an end. 
$Beneath the bamboos of that grove $I shall attain final nirvana without remainder. 
$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, Venerable $Anuruddha and the [other] monks were delighted and received it respectfully.

^ck The Discourse on the Path $to Pure Imperturbability45$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying in Kuru country, in $the Kuru town of Kammāssadhamma. 
$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $Sensual pleasures are impermanent, unreal, false, of a false nature, being $indeed illusory, deceptive, and delusive. 
Sensual pleasures now or in the $future, material forms now or in the future—all of these are the domain $of Māra;46 they are indeed Māra’s bait, due to which countless evil and $unwholesome states, [such as] covetousness and anger, arise in the mind, $leading to quarrelling, [all of] which create an obstruction for a noble dis￾ciple in training. 
$A learned noble disciple contemplates, “The World-honored One has $taught that sensual pleasures are impermanent, unreal, false, of a false $nature, being indeed illusory, deceptive, and delusive. 
$“Sensual pleasures now or in the future, material forms now or in the $future—all of these are the domain of Māra; they are indeed Māra’s bait, $since because of them countless evil and unwholesome states, [such as] $covetousness and anger, arise in the mind, leading to quarrelling, [all of] $which create obstructions for a noble disciple in training.” $He reflects thus, “Let me attain an expansive state of mind and dwell in $it, overcoming worldliness [by] taking control of my mind. 
If I attain an $expansive state of mind and dwell in it, overcoming worldliness [by] taking $control of my mind, then in this way countless evil and unwholesome states, $[such as] covetousness and anger, will not arise in the mind, leading to quar￾relling, [all of] which create obstructions for a noble disciple in training.” $44^taisho542b Division 7$By means of this practice, by means of this training, by cultivating in $this way, broadly and extensively, he attains purity of the mind in regard $to that sphere. 
$Having attained purity of the mind in regard to that sphere, such a $monk will either gain entry into imperturbability right here, or else employ $wisdom for the sake of liberation. 
At a later time, when the body breaks $up and life ends, because of that former mental disposition he will certainly $attain the imperturbable. 
This is reckoned the first explanation of the path $to pure imperturbability. 
$Again, a learned noble disciple contemplates thus, “If there are material $forms, they are all [made up] of the four elements and what is derived $from the four elements.47 The four elements are of an impermanent nature, $dukkha, and [subject] to cessation.” $Practicing in this way, training in this way, cultivating in this way, $broadly and extensively, he attains purity of the mind in regard to that $sphere. 
Having attained purity of the mind in regard to that sphere, such $a monk will either gain entry into imperturbability right here, or else $employ wisdom for the sake of liberation. 
At a later time, when the body $breaks up and life ends, because of that former mental disposition he will $certainly reach the imperturbable. 
This is reckoned the second explanation $of the path to pure imperturbability. 
$Again, a learned noble disciple contemplates thus, “Sensual pleasures $now or in the future, forms now or in the future, sensual perceptions now $or in the future, perceptions of form now or in the future—all of these per￾ceptions are of an impermanent nature, dukkha, and [subject] to cessation.” $At that time he will certainly attain the perception of imperturbability.

$45^taisho542c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Again, a learned noble disciple contemplates thus, “Sensual perceptions $now or in the future, perceptions of form now or in the future, and the $perception of imperturbability—all of these perceptions are of an imper￾manent nature, dukkha, and [subject] to cessation.”48$At that time he will attain the perception of nothingness.

At a later time, when the body breaks up and life ends, because $of that former mental disposition he will certainly attain <the sphere of $nothingness>.$49 This is reckoned the first explanation of the path to the $sphere of pure nothingness. 
$Again, a learned noble disciple contemplates, “This world is empty, $empty of a self and of anything belonging to a self, empty of anything $permanent, empty of anything enduring, empty of continuous existence, $empty of being unchanging.”50$Practicing in this way, training in this way, cultivating in this way, $broadly and extensively, he attains purity of the mind in regard to that $sphere.

$46^taisho543a Division 7$Again, a learned noble disciple contemplates, thus: “Sensual pleasures $now or in the future, material forms now or in the future, sensual percep￾tions now or in the future, perceptions of form now or in the future, the $perception of imperturbability, and the perception of the sphere of noth￾ingness—all of these perceptions are of an impermanent nature, dukkha,$and [subject] to cessation.”52$At that time he will attain [neither-perception-nor-]nonperception. 
$Practicing in this way, training in this way, cultivating in this way, broadly $and extensively, he attains purity of the mind in regard to that sphere. 
$Having attained purity of the mind in regard to that sphere, such a monk $will gain entry into [neither-perception-nor-]nonperception right here, or $else employ wisdom for the sake of liberation.

$This is reckoned the explanation of the path to pure [neither-perception￾nor-]nonperception. 
$At that time Venerable Ānanda was fanning the Buddha. 
Then Venerable $Ānanda extended his hands with palms joined towards the Buddha and said: $World-honored One, suppose a monk practices thus: “There is no I, nor $anything belonging to me; I will not be, what belongs to me will not be. 
$If [something] has earlier [come to] exist, it will be extinguished,” and $he attains equanimity [by practicing in this way]. 
World-honored One, $will a monk who practices in this way ultimately attain final nirvana?” $The World-honored One replied, “Ānanda, this matter is uncertain. 
There $are some who attain it; there are some who do not attain it.” $Venerable Ānanda said, “World-honored One, [through] practicing in $what way does a monk not attain final nirvana?” $The World-honored One said: $Ānanda, suppose a monk practices in this way: “[There is] no I, nor any￾thing belonging to me; I will not be, what belongs to me will not be. 
If $[something] has earlier [come to] exist, it will be extinguished,” and he $attains equanimity [by practicing in this way]. 
Ānanda, if the monk delights $in that equanimity, becomes attached to that equanimity, becomes established $47$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$in that equanimity, then, Ānanda, practicing in this way the monk will $certainly not attain final nirvana.” $Venerable Ānanda said, “World-honored One, if a monk has such clinging $he will then not attain final nirvana?” $The World-honored One said, “Ānanda, if a monk has such clinging he $will certainly not attain final nirvana.” $Venerable Ānanda said, “World-honored One, to what is that monk $clinging?” $The World-honored One said, “Ānanda, in his practice there is a remainder $[of clinging], namely, to the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception. 
$Among [states of] existence this is foremost, and that monk is clinging to it.” $Venerable Ānanda said, “World-honored One, so that monk is practicing $with a remainder of clinging?” $The World-honored One said, “Ānanda, in this way the monk is indeed $practicing with a remainder of clinging.” $Venerable Ānanda said, “World-honored One, by practicing in what way $will a monk certainly attain final nirvana?” $The World-honored One said: $Ānanda, suppose a monk practices in this way: “[There is] no I, nor any￾thing belonging to me; I will not be, and what belongs to me will not be. 
$If [something] has earlier [come to] exist, it will be extinguished” and he $[thereby] attains equanimity. 
Ānanda, if the monk does not delight in that $equanimity, does not become attached to that equanimity, does not become $established in that equanimity, then, Ānanda, practicing in this way the $monk will certainly attain final nirvana. 
$Venerable Ānanda said, “World-honored One, if a monk clings to nothing, $then will he certainly attain final nirvana?” $The World-honored One said, “Ānanda, if a monk clings to nothing he $will certainly attain final nirvana.” $Then Venerable Ānanda extended his hands with palms joined toward the $Buddha and said: $The World-honored One has explained the path to pure imperturbability, $he has explained the path to the sphere of pure nothingness, he has $48^taisho543b Division 7$explained the path to pure [neither-perception-nor-]nonperception, he has $explained nirvana without remainder.53 World-honored One, what is noble $liberation? $The World-honored One replied: $Ānanda, a learned noble disciple contemplates in this way: “Sensual pleas￾ures now or in the future, forms now or in the future, sensual perceptions $now or in the future, perceptions of form now or in the future, the perception $of imperturbability, the perception of the sphere of nothingness, and the $perception of [neither-perception-nor-]nonperception—all of these per￾ceptions are of an impermanent nature, dukkha, and [subject] to cessation. 
$This is what is called one’s own existence (sakkāya). 
If there is one’s own $existence, [then] there is birth, old age, disease, and death.” $Ānanda, if there is this reality—total extinction, cessation without $remainder, no further existence—then there will be no birth, old age, dis￾ease, and death. 
$A noble [disciple] contemplates thus: “If this exists, it certainly has $the nature of liberation. 
If there is nirvana without remainder, that is called $the deathless.” With such contemplation and such a view he will certainly $attain liberation of the mind from the taint of sensual desire, liberation of $the mind from the taint of existence and from the taint of ignorance. 
Being $liberated, he knows he is liberated, knowing as it really is: “Birth has been $ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been $done. 
There will not be another experiencing of existence.” $Ānanda, I have now explained to you the path to pure imperturbability, $I have explained the path to the sphere of pure nothingness, I have explained $the path to pure [neither-perception-nor-]nonperception, I have explained $nirvana without remainder, and I have explained noble liberation. 
$What a teacher should do for his disciples out of great compassion, $mercy, sympathy, and concern, seeking their benefit and welfare, seeking $their safety and happiness, that I have now already done. 
$You too should do your part. 
Go and sit in meditation and contemplation $in a secluded place, in a forest, at the base of a tree, in an empty and quiet $place. 
Do not be negligent, make diligent effort, lest you [come to] regret $it later. 
This is my instruction, this is my teaching! $49$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, Venerable $Ānanda and the [other] monks were delighted and received it respectfully.

^ck The Discourse $at Ukkācelā54$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Ukkācelā, on $the bank of a pond by the Ganges River. 
$At that time, in the afternoon a certain monk rose from sitting in meditation, $approached the Buddha, paid homage at the Buddha’s feet, and stepped back $to sit to one side. 
He said: $May the World-honored One well teach me the Dharma in brief. 
Having $heard the Dharma from the World-honored One, I will stay in a remote $and solitary place and practice diligently, with a mind free of indolence. 
$Through staying in a remote and solitary place and practicing diligently, $with a mind free of indolence, may I accomplish the holy life, for the sake $of which clansmen shave off hair and beards, don yellow robes, leave $home out of faith, and go forth to practice the path and attain fully the $summit of the holy life.

^ck The Discourse on Three $Clansmen at Sāketa61$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāketa, in Añjana $Forest. 
$At that time in Sāketa there were three clansmen, Venerable Anuruddha, $Venerable Nandiya, and Venerable Kimbila, who had just gone forth together $at a young age to train, having recently come to enter this true Dharma together. 
$Then the World-honored One asked the monks: $These three clansmen, who have just gone forth together at a young age to $train, having recently come to enter this true Dharma together, do these three $clansmen delight in practicing the holy life in this true Dharma and discipline? $54$Division 7$Then all of the monks kept silent and did not reply. 
$A second and a third time the World-honored One asked the monks: 544c$These three clansmen, who have just gone forth together at a young age $to train, having recently come to enter this true Dharma together, do these $three clansmen delight in practicing the holy life in this true Dharma and $discipline? $A second and a third time all of the monks again kept silent and did not reply. 
$Then the World-honored One himself asked the three clansmen, saying $to Venerable Anuruddha: $You three clansmen have just gone forth together at a young age to train, $having recently come to enter this true Dharma together. 
Anuruddha, do $you all delight in practicing the holy life in this true Dharma and discipline? $Venerable Anuruddha replied, “That is so, World-honored One. 
We do $delight in practicing the holy life in this true Dharma and discipline.” $The World-honored One said: $Anuruddha, you are in your youth, you are young lads, with completely $black hair and healthy bodies. 
You [could have] delighted in recreation, $delighting in bathing frequently and adorning the body, being surrounded $by relatives and parents who cherish you, who with weeping and tears $did not wish you to go forth to train in the path. 
$[Yet] you were able to shave off your hair and beards, don yellow robes, $leave home out of faith, and go forth to practice the path. 
Anuruddha, you $are not training in the path out of fear of kings, or fear of robbers, or fear $of debts, or other fears, nor are you training in the path because you fear $poverty and the inability to make a living. 
Is it not rather because you are $weary of birth, old age, disease, death, sorrow and distress and wish to $transcend this great mass of dukkha? Anuruddha, is it not out of such a $state of mind that you have gone forth to train in the path? $[Venerable Anuruddha] answered, “That is so.” $[The Buddha said,] “Anuruddha, if a clansman goes forth to train in the $path because of such a state of mind, does he know the way to attain countless $wholesome states?” $55$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Venerable Anuruddha said to the World-honored One: $The World-honored One is the source of the Dharma, the World-honored $One is the master of the Dharma, the Dharma comes from the World-hon￾ored One. 
May he explain this and, having heard it, we will come to know $the meaning fully. 
$The Buddha said, “Anuruddha, listen closely and pay proper attention. 
I $shall analyze the meaning of this for you.” Anuruddha and his companions $listened to receive the teaching. 
$The World-honored One said: $Anuruddha, if one is overwhelmed by desires and is in the grip of evil $states, then one does not attain the happiness of renunciation, the supreme $peace of tranquility.Then one’s mind gives rise to covetousness, ill-will, $and sloth-and-torpor, the mind gives rise to discontent, the body becomes $lethargic, and one overeats and becomes depressed. 
$Such a monk is unable to bear hunger and thirst, cold and heat, mos￾quitoes, gadflies, flies and fleas, and irritation by the wind or the sun. 
He $is also unable to bear [receiving] evil speech or being beaten with sticks. 
$[If] the body encounters all sorts of diseases, so painful that one wishes $to end one’s life, or whatever [else] is undesirable—all of that he is unable $to endure. 
$Why is that? Because he is overwhelmed by sensual desire and is in $the grip of evil states he does not attain the happiness of renunciation, the $supreme peace of tranquility. 
$If he is secluded from sensual desire and not in the grip of evil states, $he will certainly attain the happiness of renunciation, the supreme peace $of tranquility. 
Then the mind will not give rise to covetousness, ill-will, $and sloth-and-torpor. 
The mind will not give rise to discontent, the body $will not become lethargic, and he will not overeat and become depressed. 
$Such a monk is able to bear hunger and thirst, cold and heat, mosquitoes, $gadflies, flies and fleas, and irritation by the wind or the sun. 
He is also $able to bear [receiving] evil speech or being beaten with sticks. 
When the $body encounters all sorts of diseases, so painful that one wishes to end $one’s life, or whatever [else] is undesirable—all of that he is able to endure.

$The World-honored One asked, “Anuruddha, why does the Tathāgata get $rid of some, make use of some, endure some, stop some, and reject some?”62$Anuruddha said to the World-honored One: $The World-honored One is the source of the Dharma, the World-honored $One is the master of the Dharma, the Dharma comes from the World-hon￾ored One. 
May he explain this; having heard it, we will come to know $the meaning fully.” $The Buddha said, “Anuruddha, listen closely and pay proper attention. 
I $shall analyze the meaning of this for you.” Anuruddha and his companions $listened to receive the teaching. 
$The World-honored One said: $Anuruddha, it is not because the Tathāgata has not eradicated the taints $and defilements that are the roots of future becoming, that result in affliction $and suffering, that are the cause of birth, old age, disease, and death; and $it is not because he does not have knowledge [of having attained liberation] $that he gets rid of some, makes use of some, endures some, stops some, $and rejects some. 
$Anuruddha, it is just because of this body, the six sense spheres, and $the life faculty that the Tathāgata gets rid of some, makes use of some, $endures some, stops some and rejects some. 
Anuruddha, this is the reason $why the Tathāgata gets rid of some, makes use of some, endures some, $stops some, and rejects some.63$The World-honored One asked: $Anuruddha, why does the Tathāgata stay in quiet places, beneath trees in $mountain forests, delighting in dwelling on high crags, in peaceful places $without noise, remote places free of evil, free of people, places conducive $to sitting in meditation?64$Venerable Anuruddha said to the World-honored One: $57$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$The World-honored One is the source of the Dharma, the World-honored $One is the master of the Dharma, the Dharma comes from the World-hon￾ored One. 
May he explain this; having heard it, we will come to know $the meaning fully.” $The Buddha said, “Anuruddha, listen closely and pay proper attention. 
I $shall analyze the meaning of this for you.” Anuruddha and his companions $listened to receive the teaching. 
$The World-honored One said: $Anuruddha, it is not because the Tathāgata wishes to attain what he has $not yet attained, wishes to gain what he has not yet gained, wishes to $realize what he has not yet realized that he stays in quiet places, beneath $trees in mountain forests, delighting in dwelling on high crags, in peaceful $places without noise, remote places free of evil and free of people, places $conducive to sitting in meditation. 
$Anuruddha, for two reasons the Tathāgata stays in quiet places, beneath $trees in mountain forests, delighting in dwelling on high crags, in peaceful $places without noise, remote places free of evil and free of people, places $conducive to sitting in meditation. 
The first is for the sake of a happy abiding $for himself here and now. 
The second is because he has compassion for $later generations, thinking “Perhaps later generations will follow the exam￾ple of the Tathāgata and stay in quiet places, beneath trees in mountain $forests, delighting in dwelling on high crags, in peaceful places without $noise, remote places free of evil and free of people, places conducive to $sitting in meditation.” $Anuruddha, for these reasons the Tathāgata stays in quiet places, beneath $trees in mountain forests, delighting in dwelling on high crags, in peaceful $places without noise, remote places free of evil and free of people, places $conducive to sitting meditation. 
$The World-honored One asked: $Anuruddha, why does the Tathāgata declare of disciples who have died $that “So-and-so has been reborn in a such-and-such a place” and “So￾and-so has been reborn in such-and-such a place”? $58^taisho545b Division 7$Venerable Anuruddha said to the World-honored One: $The World-honored One is the source of the Dharma, the World-honored $One is the master of the Dharma, the Dharma comes from the World-hon￾ored One.

$The World-honored One said: $Anuruddha, the Tathāgata does not say this in order to get people interested. 
$It is not in order to deceive people, or out of a wish to make people happy, $that he declares of disciples who have died that “So-and-so has been $reborn in a such-and-such a place” and “So-and-so has been reborn in $such-and-such a place.” $Anuruddha, the Tathāgata does this just so pure and faithful clansmen $and clanswomen, who have great faith and great devotion, may develop $great delight, and so that on hearing this true Dharma and discipline they $might wish to follow these examples, just like that. 
It is for this reason $that [the Tathāgata] declares of disciples who have died that “So-and-so $has been reborn in a such-and-such a place” and “So-and-so has been $reborn in such-and-such a place.” $A monk may hear that Venerable So-and-so has died at such-and-such $a place and that the Buddha declared that [the deceased] had attained final $knowledge, knowing as it really is: “Birth has been ended, the holy life $has been established, what had to be done has been done, there will not $be another experiencing of existence.” Either he may have himself seen $that venerable one, or he may have frequently heard from others, “That $venerable one had faith thus, adhered to the precepts thus, had broad learn￾ing thus, practiced kind generosity thus, had wisdom thus.” Having heard $that, this person recollects the faith of that venerable one, his adherence $to the precepts, his broad learning, his kind generosity, and his wisdom.

^ck The Discourse on Brahmā’s $ Invitation to the Buddha65$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī, staying $in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time there was a certain Brahmā dwelling in the Brahmā world $who had given rise to this wrong view: “This realm is permanent, this realm $is everlasting, this realm endures forever, this realm is the essence, this realm $is of an unending nature. 
This realm is release; there is no other release $superior to this release. 
This is the supreme, the sublime, the ultimate.” $65^taisho547a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Then, the World-honored One, who with his knowledge of the minds of $others had come to know the thoughts in the mind of that Brahmā, entered $an appropriate state of concentration. 
Through this appropriate state of con￾centration, just as [easily and swiftly] as a strong man could bend and stretch $out his arm, he disappeared from Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park in $Sāvatthī, and appeared in the Brahmā world. 
$At that time, on seeing the World-honored One arrive, that Brahmā invited $the World-honored One: $Welcome, Great Seer! This realm is permanent, this realm is everlasting, $this realm endures forever, this realm is the essence, this realm is of an $unending nature. 
This realm is release; there is no other release superior $to this release. 
This is the supreme, the sublime, the ultimate. 
$Then the World-honored One said: $Brahmā, you praise as permanent what is impermanent; you praise as $everlasting what is not everlasting; you praise as enduring what is not $enduring; you praise as the essence what is not the essence; you praise as $having an unending nature what is of a nature to end. 
You praise as release $what is not release, [claiming] that there is no other release superior to $this release, that this is the supreme, the sublime, the ultimate. 
Brahmā, $this is ignorance on your part. 
Brahmā, this is ignorance on your part. 
$At that time, Māra, the Evil One was among that assembly.66 Then Māra, $the Evil One, said to the World-honored One: $Monk, do not contradict what this Brahmā says! Do not oppose what this $Brahmā says! Monk, if you contradict what this Brahmā says, if you $oppose what this Brahmā says, then, monk, it will be just as if someone $were to bring you something auspicious but you were to reject it. 
What $you say, monk, is just like that. 
$Therefore, monk, I tell you, “Do not contradict what this Brahmā says! $Do not oppose what this Brahmā says!” Monk, if you contradict what this $Brahmā says, if you oppose what this Brahmā says, then, monk, you will $be just like a man who is falling from a mountaintop and grabs at empty $space with his hands and feet but finds nothing to hold on to. 
What you $say, monk, is just like that. 
$66^taisho547b Division 7$Therefore, monk, I tell you, “Do not contradict what this Brahmā says! $Do not oppose what this Brahmā says!” Monk, if you contradict what this $Brahmā says, if you oppose what this Brahmā says, then, monk, you will $be just like a man who is falling from a treetop and grabs at twigs and $leaves with his hands and feet but finds nothing to hold on to. 
What you $say, monk, is just like that. 
$Therefore, monk, I tell you, “Do not contradict what this Brahmā says! $Do not oppose what this Brahmā says!” Why is that? This is the Brahmā $of Brahmās, the fortunate one, who is capable of magical transformations. 
$He is the most venerable one, capable of making, capable of creating. 
He $is the father [of all sentient beings]; whatever sentient beings have arisen $or will arise, all of them arise from him. 
He knows all that is to be known; $he sees all that is to be seen. 
$Great Seer, if a renunciant or brahmin detests the earth [element] and $disparages earth, then on the breaking up of the body at death he will certainly $be reborn among the lowliest nymphs. 
It is the same for [the elements of] $water, ...
fire, ...
[and] wind, ...
for spirits ...
devas ...
Pajāpati, ...
if $he detests Brahmā and disparages Brahmā, then on the breaking up of the $body at death he will certainly be reborn among the lowliest nymphs. 
$[On the other hand,] Great Seer, if a renunciant or brahmin delights in $the earth [element] and praises earth, then on the breaking up of the body $at death he will certainly be reborn among the highest and most venerated $Brahmās. 
$It is the same for [the elements of] water, ...

Pajāpati, ...
if he delights in Brahmā and praises $Brahmā, then on the breaking up of the body at death he will certainly be $reborn among the highest and most venerated Brahmās. 
Great Seer, do $you not see this great assembly of Brahmā’s retinue, seated here on the $same level as me? $That Māra, the Evil One, though not a Brahmā or one of Brahmā’s retinue, $claimed of himself, “I am a Brahmā.” $At that time, the World-honored One had this thought, “This Māra, the $Evil One, though he is not a Brahmā or one of Brahmā’s retinue, claims of $himself, ‘I am a Brahmā.’ If ever there was one called Māra, the Evil One, $then it is just this Māra, the Evil One.” $67$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Having understood this, the World-honored One said: $Māra, Evil One, you are not Brahmā nor are you one of Brahmā’s retinue, $yet you claim of yourself, “I am a Brahmā.” If ever there was one called $Māra, the Evil One, then you are just this Māra, the Evil One. 
$Then Māra, the Evil One, thought, “The World-honored One knows me; $the Well-gone One sees me.” Knowing this, he became despondent and $promptly disappeared right there.67$Then that Brahmā [again] invited the World-honored One up to three $times: $Welcome, Great Seer. 
This realm is permanent, this realm is everlasting, $this realm endures forever, this realm is the essence, this realm is of an $unending nature. 
This realm is release; there is no other release superior $to this release. 
This is the supreme, the sublime, the ultimate. 
$The World-honored One also said up to three times: $Brahmā, you praise as permanent what is impermanent; you praise as $everlasting what is not everlasting; you praise as enduring what is not $enduring; you praise as the essence what is not the essence; you praise as $having an unending nature what is of a nature to end. 
You praise as release $what is not release, [claiming] that there is no other release superior to $this release, that this is the supreme, the sublime, the ultimate. 
Brahmā, $this is ignorance on your part. 
Brahmā, this is ignorance on your part. 
$Then the Brahmā said to the World-honored One: $Great Seer, formerly there were renunciants and brahmins of exceedingly $long life spans who remained living for an extremely long time. 
Great $Seer, your life span is extremely short, less than the duration of a single $sitting in seclusion of those renunciants and brahmins. 
$Why is that? They knew all that is to be known, they saw all that is to $be seen. 
If there really is a release, then there is no other release superior $to this release, for this is the supreme, the sublime, the ultimate. 
And if $there really is no release, then there is no other release superior to this $release, for this is the supreme, the sublime, the ultimate. 
Great Seer, you $perceive what is release as not being release; you perceive what is not $68^taisho547c Division 7$release as being release. 
In this way you will not attain release; [instead] $it will become a great delusion [for you]. 
$Why is that? Because this is beyond your limits. 
$Great Seer, if a renunciant or brahmin delights in earth and praises earth, $then he is under my dominion; he must follow my wishes, must follow my $orders. 
In the same way for water, ...
fire, ...wind, ...
spirits, ...
devas, ...
$Pajāpati, ...
if he delights in Brahmā, praises Brahmā, then he is under $my dominion; he must follow my wishes, must follow my orders.

Pajā-$pati, ...
if you delight in Brahmā and praise Brahmā, then you too are $under my dominion; you must follow my wishes, must follow my orders. 
$At this the World-honored One said: $It is so, Brahmā; what Brahmā has spoken is the truth. 
If a renunciant or $brahmin delights in the earth [element] and praises the earth, then he is $under your dominion; he must follow your wishes and follow your orders. 
$In the same way for water, ...

$Pajāpati, ...
if he delights in Brahmā and praises Brahmā, then he is under $your dominion; he must follow your wishes and follow your orders. 
$Brahmā, if I were to delight in the earth [element] and praise the earth, $then I too would be under your dominion; I would have to follow your $wishes and follow your orders. 
In the same way for water, ...
fire, ...
$wind, ...

Pajāpati, ...
if I were to delight in Brahmā $and praise Brahmā, then I too would be under your dominion; I would $have to follow your wishes and follow your orders. 
$Brahmā, as to these eight objects, [the four elements and four classes $of divine beings,] if I were to follow these objects, to delight in them and $praise them, then it would be the way [you have described]. 
$[However,] Brahmā, I know where you have come from and where $you are going, according to where you dwelled, according to where your $life ended, and according to where you were reborn. 
[I know that] if one $exists as a Brahmā one has great supernormal power, great and mighty $virtue, great merit, great divine might. 
$69^taisho548a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$At this the Brahmā said to the World-honored One: $Great Seer, how do you know what I know and see what I see? How do $you completely cognize my dominion, which is like the sun, brightly illu￾minating all directions in these thousand worlds? Have you [too] gained $dominion within these thousand worlds? In knowing those various spheres $where there is no day and night, have you, Great Seer, passed through $them? Have you often passed through them? $The World-honored One replied: $Brahmā, your dominion is like the sun, brightly illuminating all directions $in the thousand worlds. 
Within these thousand worlds, I [too] have attained $dominion and I also know those various spheres where there is no day $and night. 
Brahmā, I have passed through them. 
I have often passed $through them. 
$Brahmā, there are three [further] classes of devas: the devas of radiance, $the devas of pure radiance, and the devas of pervasive pure radiance.68$Brahmā, whatever knowledge and vision those three classes of devas pos￾sess, I too possess that knowledge and vision. 
Brahmā, whatever knowledge $and vision these three classes of devas do not possess, I myself possess $that knowledge and vision. 
Brahmā, whatever knowledge and vision those $three classes of devas and their retinues possess, I too possess that knowl￾edge and vision. 
Brahmā, whatever knowledge and vision these three $classes of devas and their retinues do not possess, I myself possess that $knowledge and vision. 
$Brahmā, whatever knowledge and vision you possess, I too possess $this knowledge and vision. 
Brahmā, whatever knowledge and vision you $do not possess, I myself possess that knowledge and vision. 
Brahmā, $whatever knowledge and vision you and your retinue possess, I too possess $this knowledge and vision. 
Brahmā, whatever knowledge and vision you $and your retinue do not possess, I possess this knowledge and vision. 
$Brahmā, you are not at all equal to me; you are not in any way equal to $me. 
Rather, I am superior to you; I am greater than you. 
$Then the Brahmā said to the World-honored One: $70^taisho548b Division 7$Great Seer, how is it that whatever knowledge and vision those three $classes of devas possess, you too possess that knowledge and vision; what￾ever knowledge and vision those three classes of devas do not possess, $you yourself possess that knowledge and vision; whatever knowledge and $vision those three classes of devas and their retinues possess, you too pos￾sess that knowledge and vision; and whatever knowledge and vision those $three classes of devas and their retinues do not possess, you yourself $possess that knowledge and vision? $[How is it that] whatever knowledge and vision I possess, you too pos￾sess this knowledge and vision; whatever knowledge and vision I do not $posses, you yourself possess that knowledge and vision; whatever knowl￾edge and vision I and my retinue possess, you too possess that knowledge $and vision; and whatever knowledge and vision I and my retinue do not $possess, you yourself possess that knowledge and vision? $Great Seer, are you not saying this out of desire? On being cross-ques￾tioned you will not know [how to reply] and become ever more confused. 
$Why is that? Because I am conscious of immeasurable worlds, I have $immeasurable knowledge, immeasurable vision, immeasurable discrimi￾nation, and I know each and every thing distinctly.

$this Brahmā I know to be Brahmā.” $At this the World-honored One said: $Brahmā, if there is a renunciant or brahmin who in regard to the earth [ele￾ment] has a perception of the earth as “the earth is me,” “ the earth is mine,” $“I belong to the earth,” then, since he reckons the earth as self, he does not $[truly] know the earth [element].

. 
In regard to purity I know purity as “purity is not me,” $“purity is not mine,” “I do not belong to purity.” Since I do not reckon $purity as self, I [truly] know purity.69$Then Brahmā said to the World-honored One: $Great Seer, these living beings desire becoming, delight in becoming, are $accustomed to becoming. 
[Yet] you have already uprooted the foundation $of becoming. 
Why is that? [Because] you are reckoned to be a tathāgata, $free from attachment, fully awakened. 
$Then [the Buddha] spoke this stanza:70$Seeing fear in becoming $And seeing no dread in nonbecoming, $Therefore do not delight in becoming! $Why should becoming not be abandoned? $[The Brahmā said,] “Great Seer, I now wish to make myself disappear.” $The World-honored One said, “Brahmā, if you wish to make yourself dis￾appear, then do as you wish.” $Then, wherever Brahmā tried to make himself disappear, the World-hon￾ored One immediately knew, “Brahmā, you are over there. 
You are here. 
You $are in between.” $Then the Brahmā did all he could to manifest his supernormal power. 
He $wished to make himself disappear but was unable to disappear. 
He returned, $72^taisho548c Division 7$remaining within the Brahmā realm. 
Then the World-honored One said, $“Brahmā, now I too wish to make myself disappear.” $Then Brahmā said to the World-honored One, “Great Seer, if you wish $to make yourself disappear, do as you wish.” $Then the World-honored One had this thought, “Let me now manifest an $appropriate supernormal power such that I send forth an extremely bright $light, illuminating the entire domain of Brahmā while remaining invisible $myself, so that Brahmā and his retinue will only hear my voice and not see $my appearance.” $Then the World-honored One manifested an appropriate supernormal $power such that he sent forth an extremely bright light, illuminating the entire $Brahmā world while remaining invisible himself, so that Brahmā and his $retinue only heard his voice and did not see his appearance.71 $Then Brahmā and everyone in Brahmā’s retinue had this thought, “The $renunciant Gotama is most wonderful, most remarkable. 
He has great super￾normal power, great and mighty virtue, great merit, great divine might. 
Why $is that? He has sent forth an extremely bright light, illuminating the entire $Brahmā world while remaining invisible himself, so that I and my retinue $only hear his voice and do not see his appearance.” $Then the World-honored One had this thought, “I have already [performed] $magical transformations for this Brahmā and his retinue. 
Now let me withdraw $my supernormal power.” $Then the World-honored One withdrew his supernormal power and returned $to remain within the Brahmā world. 
Then King Māra again joined the assembly, $up to three times.72 At that time King Māra said to the World-honored One: $Great Seer, you see well, you know well, you realize well. 
But do not $teach and instruct disciples, and do not teach the Dharma to disciples! $Do not become attached to [having] disciples. 
Do not, through being $attached [to having] disciples, take rebirth among the lowliest nymphs $on the breaking up of the body at death. 
Practice non-action. 
[Just] expe￾rience happiness in the present life. 
Why is that? Great Seer, you will only $trouble yourself in vain. 
$Great Seer, in former times there were renunciants and brahmins who $instructed disciples, taught disciples, and taught the Dharma to disciples. 
$73^taisho549a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$They delighted in and became attached to [having] disciples. 
Through $being attached to [having] disciples, they were reborn among the lowliest $nymphs on the breaking up of the body at death. 
$For this reason, Great Seer, I tell you, “Do not teach and instruct dis￾ciples, and do not teach the Dharma to disciples. 
Do not become attached $to [having] disciples. 
Do not, through being attached to [having] disciples, $take rebirth among the lowliest nymphs on the breaking up of the body $at death. 
Practice nonaction. 
[Just] experience happiness in the present $life. 
Why is that? Great Seer, you will only trouble yourself in vain.” $Then the World-honored One said: $Māra, Evil One, it is not because you seek benefit, welfare, happiness, or $ease for me that you tell me, “Do not teach and instruct disciples and do $not teach the Dharma to disciples. 
Do not become attached to [having] $disciples. 
Do not, through being attached to [having] disciples, take rebirth $among the lowliest nymphs on the breaking up of the body at death. 
Prac￾tice non-action. 
[Just] experience happiness in the present life. 
Why is $that? Great Seer, you will only trouble yourself in vain.” $Māra, Evil One, you have this thought: “This renunciant Gotama will $teach the Dharma to disciples. 
Having heard the Dharma, the disciples $will escape from my domain.” Māra, Evil One, it is for this reason that $you tell me, “Do not teach and instruct disciples and do not teach the $Dharma to disciples. 
Do not become attached to [having] disciples. 
Do $not, through being attached to [having] disciples, take rebirth among the $lowliest nymphs on the breaking up of the body at death. 
Practice non￾action. 
[Just] experience happiness in the present life. 
Why is that? Great $Seer, you will only trouble yourself in vain.” $Māra, Evil One, suppose that there have been renunciants and brahmins $who instructed disciples, taught disciples, and taught the Dharma to dis￾ciples, who delighted in and became attached to [having] disciples, and $who, through being attached to [having] disciples, were reborn among $the lowliest nymphs on the breaking up of the body at death. 
$Those renunciants and brahmins claimed to be renunciants without $being renunciants, they claimed to be brahmins without being brahmins, $74$Division 7$they claimed to be arahants without being arahants, they claimed to be $fully awakened without being fully awakened. 
$Māra, Evil One, I claim to be a renunciant while truly being a renun￾ciant, I claim to be a brahmin while truly being a brahmin, I claim to be $an arahant while truly being an arahant, I claim to be fully awakened while $truly being fully awakened. 
$Māra, Evil One, as to whether I do or do not teach the Dharma to dis￾ciples—you just keep out of that! I now know for myself when it is proper $to teach the Dharma to disciples and when it is not proper to teach the $Dharma to disciples.73$Such was the invitation by Brahmā and the opposition by Māra, the Evil $One, to what the World-honored One said in response. 
For this reason this $discourse is called “Brahmā’s Invitation to the Buddha.” $Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, Brahmā and $his retinue were delighted and received it respectfully. 
$79. 
^ck The Discourse on the $Existence of Higher Devas74$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī, staying $in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$Then, the chamberlain Isidatta instructed a messenger:75$Approach the Buddha, pay homage on my behalf at the World-honored $One’s feet, and ask the World-honored One if the noble one is healthy $and strong in body, comfortable and free from ailments, and dwelling at $ease, with his usual vigor. 
Say this: “Chamberlain Isidatta pays homage $at the Buddha’s feet and asks the World-honored One if the noble one is $healthy and strong, comfortable and free from ailments, dwelling at ease, $with his usual vigor.” $When you have inquired of the Buddha in this way, you should approach $Venerable Anuruddha and, having paid homage on my behalf at his feet, $ask the venerable one if the noble one is healthy and strong, comfortable $and free from ailments, and dwelling at ease, with his usual vigor. 
Say this: $“Chamberlain Isidatta pays homage at Venerable Anuruddha’s feet and $75^taisho549b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$asks the venerable one if the noble one is healthy and strong, comfortable $and free from ailments, dwelling at ease, with his usual vigor. 
Chamberlain $Isidatta invites Venerable Anuruddha, together [with three others,] four $people in total, for tomorrow’s meal.” $If he accepts the invitation, then also say this: “Venerable Anuruddha, $Chamberlain Isidatta is very busy with many affairs, numerous affairs to $be taken into consideration and managed for the king.76 May Venerable $Anuruddha [and his companions], four people in total, out of compassion $come to Chamberlain Isidatta’s house tomorrow early in the morning.” $Then, on having received these instructions from Chamberlain Isidatta, $the messenger approached the Buddha, paid homage at the Buddha’s feet $and, standing back to one side, said: $World-honored One, Chamberlain Isidatta pays homage at the Buddha’s $feet and asks if the World-honored One is healthy and strong, comfortable $and free from ailments, dwelling at ease, with his usual vigor. 
$At that time, the World-honored One said to the messenger, “May Cham￾berlain Isidatta find well-being and happiness! May all devas, human beings, $asuras, gandhabbas, yakkhas, and all other forms of life find well-being and $happiness!” $Then the messenger, having received well and remembered well what he $had heard the Buddha say, paid homage at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated $him three times, and left. 
He approached Venerable Anuruddha, paid homage $at his feet, stepped back, sat to one side, and said: $Venerable Anuruddha, Chamberlain Isidatta pays homage at the feet of $Venerable Anuruddha and asks the venerable one if the noble one is healthy $and strong, comfortable and free from ailments, and dwelling at ease, $with his usual vigor. 
Chamberlain Isidatta invites Venerable Anuruddha $[together with three others], four people in total, for tomorrow’s meal. 
$At that time Venerable Kaccāna the Real was seated in meditation not far $from Venerable Anuruddha. 
Then Venerable Anuruddha said to Venerable $Kaccāna: $76^taisho549c Division 7$Just now I was saying that we will go into Sāvatthī tomorrow morning to $beg for almsfood, and now this has come up. 
Chamberlain Isidatta has dis￾patched a messenger inviting us, four people altogether, for tomorrow’s meal. 
$Venerable Kaccāna the Real said: $May Venerable Anuruddha, for the sake of that man [the Chamberlain $Isidatta], accept the invitation by remaining silent. 
Tomorrow morning $we will leave this Sītavana and enter Sāvatthī [as if] to beg for almsfood. 
$May Venerable Anuruddha, for the sake of that man, accept the invitation $by remaining silent. 
$Then, when the messenger understood that Venerable Anuruddha had $accepted by remaining silent, he also made this request: $Chamberlain Isidatta says to Venerable Anuruddha, “Chamberlain Isidatta $is very busy with many affairs, numerous affairs to attend to and manage $for the king. 
May Venerable Anuruddha [and his companions], four people $in total, out of compassion come to Chamberlain Isidatta’s house tomorrow $early in the morning.” $Venerable Anuruddha told the messenger, “You may return. 
I myself will $know the proper time.” Then the messenger rose from his seat, paid homage, $circumambulated [Venerable Anuruddha] three times, and left. 
$Then, when the night was over, at dawn, Venerable Anuruddha put on his $robes, took his bowl, and [with his companions], four people in total, $approached the house of Chamberlain Isidatta. 
At that time, Chamberlain $Isidatta was standing at the middle entrance [of his house], surrounded by $the women [of his household], waiting for Venerable Anuruddha. 
He saw $Venerable Anuruddha coming in the distance. 
On seeing him, he extended $his hands with palms joined toward Venerable Anuruddha and respectfully $said, “Welcome, Venerable Anuruddha! Venerable Anuruddha has not been $here for a long time.” Then, respectfully supporting Venerable Anuruddha $by the arm, Chamberlain Isidatta led him into the house and invited him to $sit on a fine seat that had been set out for him. 
$Venerable Anuruddha sat down on that seat. 
Chamberlain Isidatta paid $homage at Venerable Anuruddha’s feet, stepped back, and sat to one side. 
$77$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Having sat down he said, “Venerable Anuruddha, I would like to ask a ques￾tion. 
May this meet with your permission!” $Venerable Anuruddha said, “Chamberlain, ask what you wish. 
Having $heard it, I will consider it.” $Chamberlain Isidatta said: $Venerable Anuruddha, some renunciants and brahmins come and tell me, $“Chamberlain, you should develop the exalted liberation of the mind $(maha ggata).” And, Venerable Anuruddha, other renunciants and brahmins $come and tell me, “Chamberlain, you should develop the immeasurable $liberation of the mind (appamāṇa).”77 Venerable Anuruddha, [regarding] $“exalted liberation of the mind” and “immeasurable liberation of the $mind,” do these two liberations differ in both wording and meaning? Or $do they differ only in wording while having the same meaning?” $Venerable Anuruddha said, “Chamberlain, as to this question you have $just asked, first answer it yourself; after that I shall answer.” $Chamberlain Isidatta said: $Venerable Anuruddha, [regarding] “exalted liberation of the mind” and $“immeasurable liberation of the mind,” [I think] that these two liberations $differ only in wording and have the same meaning. 
$Chamberlain Isidatta was thus unable to answer the question [correctly]. 
$Venerable Anuruddha said: $Chamberlain, listen while I explain to you what is “exalted liberation of $the mind” and what is “immeasurable liberation of the mind.” Regarding $“exalted liberation of the mind,” suppose that a renunciant or brahmin, $staying in a forest area, goes to the base of a tree in an empty quiet place. 
$Dwelling in reliance on this one tree, he achieves, through mental resolve, $pervasion [of the area beneath the tree] with his exalted liberation of the $mind. 
His liberation of the mind has this limit and does not go beyond it. 
$Suppose that dwelling in reliance on not [just] one tree but two or three $trees, [the renunciant or brahmin] achieves, through mental resolve, per￾vasion [of the area beneath those two or three trees] with his exalted lib￾eration of the mind. 
[Yet] his liberation of the mind has this limit and does $78^taisho550a Division 7$not go beyond it. 
Suppose that dwelling in reliance on not [just] two or $three trees but an [entire] forest, he achieves, through mental resolve, per￾vasion [of that area] with his exalted liberation of the mind. 
[Yet] his lib￾eration of the mind has this limit and does not go beyond it. 
$Suppose that, dwelling in reliance on not [just] one forest but two or $three forests, ...
Suppose that, dwelling in reliance on not [just] two or $three forests but a village, ...
Suppose that, dwelling in reliance on not $[just] one village but two or three villages, ...
Suppose that, dwelling $in reliance on not [just] two or three villages but a country, ...
Suppose $that, dwelling in reliance on not [just] one country but two or three coun￾tries, ...
Suppose that, dwelling in reliance on not [just] two or three $countries but this entire great Earth, as far as the great ocean, [the renunciant $or brahmin] achieves, through mental resolve, pervasion [of that vast $area] with his exalted liberation of the mind. 
[Yet] his liberation of the $mind has this limit and does not go beyond it. 
This is what is meant by $“exalted liberation of the mind.” $Chamberlain, what is “immeasurable liberation of the mind”? Suppose $that a renunciant or brahmin, staying in a forest area, goes to the base of $a tree in an empty quiet place. 
He dwells with a mind imbued with lov￾ing-kindness, pervading one direction, likewise the second, the third, and $the fourth directions, and also the four intermediate directions, above, and $below, all around, everywhere. 
He dwells pervading the entire world with $a mind imbued with loving-kindness, without fetters or resentment, without $ill-will or contention, [a mind] that is boundless, exalted, immeasurable, $and well cultivated. 
In the same way he dwells with a mind imbued with $compassion, ...
with empathetic joy, ...
with equanimity, pervading the $entire world with a mind imbued with equanimity, without fetters or resent￾ment, without ill-will or contention, [a mind] that is boundless, exalted, $immeasurable, and well cultivated. 
This is what is meant by “immeasurable $liberation of the mind.” $Chamberlain, this “exalted liberation of the mind” and this “immea￾surable liberation of the mind”—do these two liberations differ in both $wording and meaning, or do they differ only in wording while having the $same meaning? $79^taisho550b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Chamberlain Isidatta said to Venerable Anuruddha, “As I have [just now] $heard it from the venerable one and consequently understood the meaning $of it, these two liberations differ in wording and also in meaning.”78$Venerable Anuruddha said: $Chamberlain, there are [these] three classes of devas: the devas of radiance, $the devas of pure radiance, and the devas of pervasive pure radiance.79$Of these, the devas of radiance are born in one [particular] realm. 
They $do not have the thought, “This belongs to me, that belongs to me”; instead, $wherever these devas of radiance go, they delight in that place. 
$Chamberlain, it is just as a fly on a piece of meat that does not have the $thought, “This belongs to me, that belongs to me” and instead, wherever that $fly goes on the piece of meat, it delights in that place.80 In the same way, the $devas of radiance do not have the thought, “This belongs to me, that belongs $to me”; instead, wherever these devas of radiance go, they delight in that $place. 
There are times when the devas of radiance assemble in one place. 
$Then, although their bodies are different, their light is the same. 
$Chamberlain, it is just as when a person lights numerous lamps and $places them in one room; although those lamps are different, their light $is the same. 
In the same way, when the devas of radiance assemble in one $place, then, although their bodies are different, their light is the same. 
$There are times when the devas of radiance separate from one another. 
$When they are separate from one another, their bodies are different and $their light is also different. 
$Chamberlain, it is just as when a person takes numerous lamps from $one room and places them separately in many different rooms; those lamps $are different and their light also differs. 
It is the same when the devas of $radiance separate from one another; when they are separate from one $another, their bodies are different and their light also differs. 
$Then Venerable Kaccāna the Real said, “Venerable Anuruddha, regarding $those devas of radiance that are born in one realm, can one know their relative $superiority, their degrees of subtlety?”81$Venerable Anuruddha replied, “Venerable Kaccāna, regarding those devas $of radiance that are born in one realm, it can be said that one can know their $relative superiority, their degrees of subtlety.” $80$Division 7$Venerable Kaccāna the Real asked further, “Venerable Anuruddha, regarding $those devas of radiance that are born in one realm, what is the cause, what is $the reason one can know their relative superiority, their degrees of subtlety?” $Venerable Anuruddha replied: $Venerable Kaccāna, suppose that a renunciant or brahmin, staying in a $forest area, goes to the base of a tree in an empty quiet place. 
Dwelling $in reliance on this one tree, he achieves perception [of the area beneath $the tree] with light produced through mental resolve. 
His perception with $mentally produced light is extremely abundant. 
[Yet] his liberation of the $mind has this limit and does not go beyond it. 
$Suppose that, dwelling in reliance on not [just] one tree but two or $three trees, he achieves perception [of the area beneath those two or three $trees] with light produced through mental resolve. 
His perception with $mentally produced light is extremely abundant. 
[Yet] his liberation of the $mind has this limit and does not go beyond it. 
$Venerable Kaccāna, of these two liberations of mind, which is higher, $which is superior, which is more subtle, which is better? $Venerable Kaccāna the Real replied: $Venerable Anuruddha, suppose that a renunciant or brahmin, dwelling in $reliance on not [just] one tree but two or three trees, achieves perception $[of the area beneath those two or three trees] with light produced through $mental resolve. 
His perception with mentally produced light is extremely $abundant. 
[Yet] his liberation of the mind has this limit and does not go $beyond it. 
Venerable Anuruddha, of these two liberations, the latter lib￾eration is higher, superior, more subtle, the best. 
$Venerable Anuruddha asked further: $Venerable Kaccāna, suppose that, dwelling in reliance on not [just] two $or three trees but a forest, ...
Suppose that, dwelling in reliance on not $[just] one forest but two or three forests, ...
Suppose that, dwelling in $reliance on not [just] two or three forests but a village, ...
Suppose that, $dwelling in reliance on not [just] one village but two or three villages, ...
$Suppose that, dwelling in reliance on not [just] two or three villages but $81^taisho550c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$a country, ...
Suppose that, dwelling in reliance on not [just] one country $but two or three countries, ...
Suppose that, dwelling in reliance on not $[just] two or three countries but this entire great Earth, up to the great $ocean, he achieves perception [of this vast area] with light produced $through mental resolve. 
His perception with mentally produced light is $extremely abundant. 
[Yet] his liberation of the mind has this limit and $does not go beyond it. 
Venerable Kaccāna, of the [latter] two liberations $of mind, which is higher, superior, more subtle, better? $Venerable Kaccāna the Real replied: $Venerable Anuruddha, suppose that, dwelling in reliance on not [just] $two or three trees but a forest, ...
Suppose that, dwelling in reliance on $not [just] one forest but two or three forests, ...
Suppose that, dwelling $in reliance on not [just] two or three forests but a village, ...
Suppose $that, dwelling in reliance on not [just] one village but two or three vil￾lages, ...
Suppose that, dwelling in reliance on not [just] two or three $villages but a country, ...
Suppose that, dwelling in reliance on not [just] $one country but two or three countries, ...
Suppose that, dwelling in $reliance on not [just] two or three countries but on this entire great Earth, $as far as the great ocean, a renunciant or a brahmin achieves perception $[of this vast area] with light produced through mental resolve. 
His per￾ception with mentally produced light is extremely abundant. 
[Yet] his lib￾eration of the mind has this limit and does not go beyond it. 
Venerable $Anuruddha, of the [latter] two liberations, the latter liberation is higher, $superior, more subtle, better.” $Venerable Anuruddha said: $[Venerable] Kaccāna, this is the cause, this is why, regarding those devas $of radiance that are born in one realm, one can know their relative supe￾riority, their degrees of subtlety. 
Why is that? It is due to the relative supe￾riority of their minds when they were human beings. 
In their development $there were degrees of refinement or crudeness. 
Because of the degrees of $refinement or crudeness in their development, human beings have degrees $of superiority. 
Venerable Kaccāna, the World-honored One has also $explained the relative superiority among human beings in this way.82$82^taisho551a Division 7$Venerable Kaccāna the Real asked further, “Venerable Anuruddha, regard￾ing those devas of pure radiance that are born in one realm, can one know $their relative superiority, their degrees of subtlety?” $Venerable Anuruddha replied, “Venerable Kaccāna, regarding those devas $of pure radiance that are born in one realm, it can be said that one can know $their relative superiority, their degrees of subtlety.” $Venerable Kaccāna the Real asked further, “Venerable Anuruddha, regard￾ing those devas of pure radiance that are born in one realm, what is the cause, $what is the reason that one can know their relative superiority, their degrees $of subtlety?” $Venerable Anuruddha replied: $Venerable Kaccāna, suppose that a renunciant or brahmin, staying in a $forest area, goes to the base of a tree in an empty quiet place. 
Through $mental resolve he achieves pervasion of the heaven of pure radiance. 
$[However,] he does not develop this concentration, does not practice it, $does not expand it, does not accomplish it fully. 
At a later time, when the $body breaks up at death, he is reborn among the devas of pure radiance. 
$After being reborn [there] he does not attain supreme tranquility, does not $attain supreme quietude, and does not complete his life course. 
$Venerable Kaccāna, it is just like when a blue lotus, or a red or crimson $lotus, or a white lotus is born in water, grows in water, and remains beneath $the water. 
Its roots, stalks, flowers, and leaves are completely saturated $with water; there is no part of it that is not saturated with water.83$Venerable Kaccāna, suppose that a renunciant or brahmin, staying in $a forest area, goes to the base of a tree in an empty quiet place. 
Through $mental resolve he achieves pervasion of the heaven of pure radiance. 
$[However,] he does not develop this concentration, does not practice it, $does not expand it, does not accomplish it fully. 
When his body breaks $up at death, he is reborn among the devas of pure radiance. 
After being $reborn [there], he does not attain supreme tranquility, does not attain $supreme quietude, and does not complete his life course. 
$Again, Venerable Kaccāna, [suppose that] a renunciant or brahmin, $staying in a forest area, goes to the base of a tree in an empty quiet place. 
$Through mental resolve he achieves pervasion of the heaven of pure $83$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$radiance. 
He frequently develops this concentration, frequently practices $it, frequently expands it, and accomplishes it fully. 
When his body breaks $up at death he is reborn among the devas of pure radiance. 
After being $reborn there, he attains supreme tranquility, attains supreme quietude, and $completes his life course. 
$Venerable Kaccāna, it is just as when a blue lotus, or a red or crimson $lotus, or a white lotus is born in water, grows in water, but then emerges $above the water, where it is no longer saturated by water. 
$In the same way, Venerable Kaccāna, a renunciant or brahmin, through $mental resolve achieves pervasion of the heaven of pure radiance. 
He fre￾quently develops this concentration, frequently practices it, frequently expands $it, and accomplishes it fully. 
When his body breaks up at death he is reborn $among the devas of pure radiance. 
After being reborn there, he attains supreme $tranquility, attains supreme quietude, and completes his life course. 
$Venerable Kaccāna, this is the cause, this is why, regarding the devas of $pure radiance that are born in one realm, one can know their relative supe￾riority, their degrees of subtlety. 
Why is that? It is due to the relative supe￾riority of their minds when they were human beings. 
In their development $there were degrees of refinement or crudeness. 
Because of the degrees of $refinement or crudeness in their development, human beings have degrees $of superiority. 
Venerable Kaccāna, the World-honored One has also explained $the relative superiority among human beings in this way. 
$Venerable Kaccāna the Real asked further, “Venerable Anuruddha, regard￾ing those devas of pervasive pure radiance that are born in one realm, can $one know their relative superiority, their degrees of subtlety?” $Venerable Anuruddha replied, “Venerable Kaccāna, regarding those devas $of pervasive pure radiance that are born in one realm, it can be said that one $can know their relative superiority, their degrees of subtlety.” $Venerable Kaccāna the Real asked further: $Venerable Anuruddha, regarding those devas of pervasive pure radiance $that are born in one realm, what is the cause, what is the reason that one $can know their relative superiority, their degrees of subtlety? $Venerable Anuruddha replied: $84^taisho551b Division 7$Venerable Kaccāna, suppose that a renunciant or brahmin, staying in a $forest area, goes to the base of a tree in an empty quiet place. 
Through $mental resolve he achieves pervasion of the heaven of pervasive pure $radiance. 
[Yet] he has not fully made an end of sloth-and-torpor, he has $not well pacified restlessness-and-worry. 
At a later time, when his body $breaks up at death, he is reborn among the devas of pervasive pure radiance. 
$On being reborn [there], his radiance is not fully pure. 
$Venerable Kaccāna, it is just like a lamp that burns in dependence on $oil and a wick. 
If there are impurities in the oil and the wick is not pure, $the light that arises in dependence on this lamp will not be bright and pure.84$In the same way, Venerable Kaccāna, suppose that a renunciant or brah￾min, staying in a forest area, goes to the base of a tree in an empty quiet $place.

When his body $breaks up at death he is reborn among the devas of pervasive pure radiance. 
$After being reborn [there] his radiance is not fully pure. 
$Again, Venerable Kaccāna, suppose that a renunciant or brahmin, stay￾ing in a forest area, goes to the base of a tree in an empty quiet place. 
$Through mental resolve he achieves pervasion of the heaven of pervasive $pure radiance. 
He has fully made an end to sloth-and-torpor, and he has $well pacified restlessness-and-worry. 
When his body breaks up at death $he is reborn among the devas of pervasive pure radiance. 
After being $reborn [there] his radiance is fully pure. 
$Venerable Kaccāna, it is just like a lamp that burns in dependence on oil $and wick. 
If there are no impurities in the oil and the wick is also fully pure, $the light that arises in dependence on this lamp will be fully bright and pure. 
$In the same way, Venerable Kaccāna, suppose that a renunciant or brah￾min, staying in a forest area, goes to the base of a tree in an empty quiet $place.

$85^taisho551c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Venerable Kaccāna, this is the cause, this is the reason why, regarding $those devas of pervasive pure radiance that are born in one realm, one $can know their relative superiority, their degrees of subtlety. 
Why is that? $It is due to the relative superiority of their minds when they were human $beings. 
In their development there were degrees of refinement or crudeness. 
$Because of the degrees of refinement or crudeness in their development, $human beings have degrees of superiority. 
Venerable Kaccāna, the World￾honored One has also explained the relative superiority among human $beings in this way. 
$Then Venerable Kaccāna the Real spoke in praise [of Anuruddha] to Cham￾berlain Isidatta: $It is well, it is well, Chamberlain! You have greatly benefited us. 
Why is $that? You first asked Venerable Anuruddha about the existence of higher $devas. 
We had never before heard from Venerable Anuruddha such an $explanation of these devas, namely that these devas exist and that these $devas are like this.85$Then Venerable Anuruddha said: $Venerable Kaccāna, there are many such devas. 
[Even] this sun and moon, $which are of such great supernormal power and such great and mighty $virtue, such great merit, such great divine might, yet their brilliance is not $equal to the brilliance [of the devas] I have personally met, with whom I $have exchanged greetings and conversed, and from whom I have received $responses. 
Yet I have never before given such an explanation of these $devas, namely that these devas exist and that these devas are like this. 
$At that time, Chamberlain Isidatta, understanding that the discussion of $those venerable ones was finished, rose from his seat and personally brought $water for washing. 
With his own hands he prepared assorted pure and tasty $dishes to eat, savor, and digest, making sure there was enough to eat. 
After $[Venerable Anuruddha] had finished eating, put aside his bowl, and washed $his hands, [Chamberlain Isidatta] took a low seat and sat to one side to listen $to the Dharma. 
When Chamberlain Isidatta had sat down, Venerable Anu￾ruddha taught him the Dharma, exhorting and inspiring him, fully delighting $86$Division 7$him. 
Having taught [Chamberlain Isidatta] the Dharma with countless skillful $means, having exhorted and inspired him, and fully delighted him, [Venerable $Anuruddha] rose from his seat and departed. 
$Thus spoke the venerable Anuruddha. 
Having heard what Venerable Anu￾ruddha said, Chamberlain Isidatta and the monks were delighted and received $it respectfully.86$80. 
^ck The Discourse on $Cloth for Robes $Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī, staying $in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time Venerable Anuruddha was also at Sāvatthī, staying on a moun￾tain crag with sāla trees. 
Then, when the night was over, at dawn, Venerable $Anuruddha put on his robes, took his bowl, and entered Sāvatthī to beg for $almsfood. 
At dawn Venerable Ānanda also put on his robes, took his bowl, $and entered Sāvatthī to beg for almsfood. 
$Venerable Anuruddha saw that Venerable Ānanda was also going to beg $for almsfood. 
Having seen him, he said, “Venerable Ānanda, you should $know that my three robes have become rough, faded, and worn out. 
Venerable $friend, now could you invite the monks to make robes for me?” Venerable $Ānanda accepted Venerable Anuruddha’s request by remaining silent. 
$Then, when Venerable Ānanda had completed begging for alms and after $he had partaken of the midday meal, he put away his robe and bowl and $washed his hands and feet. 
With a sitting mat over his shoulder and holding $a door key in his hand, he went from hut to hut and said to each monk he $visited, “Venerable one, come to the mountain crag with sāla trees to make $robes for Venerable Anuruddha.” $Then the monks, having heard what Venerable Ānanda said, all went to $the mountain crag with sāla trees to make robes for Venerable Anuruddha. 
$Then the World-honored One saw Venerable Ānanda going from hut to hut $with a door key in his hand. 
Having seen him, he asked, “Ānanda, in regard $to what matter are you going from hut to hut with a door key in your hand?” $Venerable Ānanda said, “World-honored One, I have just now asked the $monks to make robes for Venerable Anuruddha.” $87^taisho552a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$The World-honored One said, “Ānanda, why did you not ask the Tathāgata $to [help] make robes for the monk Anuruddha?” $Then Venerable Ānanda extended his hands with palms joined toward the $Buddha and said, “May the World-honored One come to the mountain crag $with sāla trees to make robes for Venerable Anuruddha.” The World-honored $One accepted Venerable Ānanda’s invitation by remaining silent. 
$Then the World-honored One, in the company of Venerable Ānanda, went $to the mountain crag with sāla trees. 
Spreading out his sitting mat, he sat $down in front of the company of monks. 
At that time, on the mountain crag $with sāla trees there were eight hundred monks seated together with the $World-honored One to make robes for Venerable Anuruddha. 
$At that time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was also among the assembly. 
$Then the World-honored One said, “Moggallāna, I can spread out the cloth $and cut it to size for Anuruddha, then cut it into pieces, stitch them together, $and sew it up.” $At that time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna rose from his seat, arranged his $robe to bare one shoulder, and, extending his hands with palms joined toward $the Buddha, said to the World-honored One, “May the World-honored One $spread out the cloth and cut it to size for Venerable Anuruddha. 
The monks $will then cut it into pieces, stitch them together, and sew them up.” $Then the World-honored One spread out the cloth and cut it to size for $Venerable Anuruddha. 
The monks together cut it into pieces, stitched them $together, and sewed them up. 
In a single day they completed three robes for $Venerable Anuruddha. 
$At that time, when the World-honored One knew that the three robes for $Venerable Anuruddha had been completed, he said, “Anuruddha, address the $monks on the nature of the cloth for robes (kaṭhina) [and of the one who will $wear it]. 
I have a backache now and wish to rest a little.” $Venerable Anuruddha replied, “Yes, World-honored One.” $Then the World-honored One folded his outer robe into four and placed $it on a bed, folded the inner robe to use as a pillow, and lay down on his right $side, one foot upon the other, arousing the perception of light, establishing $right mindfulness and right comprehension, constantly keeping in mind the $thought of rising again. 
$At that time Venerable Anuruddha addressed the monks: $88^taisho552b Division 7$Venerable friends, when I had not yet gone forth to train in the path, I had $[already] become weary of birth, old age, disease, death, sorrow and distress, $weeping and lamentation, and I aspired to abandon this great mass of $dukkha. 
Venerable friends, having become weary, I had this contemplation: $“The household life is confined, a dusty place; going forth to train in the $path is [like] emerging into a vast open space. 
Now for me at home, chained $with [such] chains, it is not possible to completely devote my life to the $practice of the holy life. 
Let me forsake my wealth, little or much, forsake $my relatives, few or many, shave off my beard and hair, don the yellow $robe and, out of faith, leave the home life and become homeless to train $in the path.” $Venerable friends, at a later time I abandoned my wealth, little or much, $left behind my relatives, few or many, shaved off my beard and hair, $donned the yellow robe and, out of faith, left the home life and became $homeless to train in the path. 
Venerable friends, having gone forth to train $in the path, having forsaken family life, I received the training of monk￾hood. 
I practiced the precepts and guarded [against breaking] the code of $rules. 
I also carefully maintained proper conduct and etiquette, always $fearing the slightest fault, upholding the training in the precepts. 
$Venerable friends, I abstained from killing, having abandoned killing. 
$I had discarded sword and club, I had a sense of shame and scruple, and $a mind of loving-kindness and compassion, [wishing to] benefit all [beings], $including insects. 
I purified my mind with regard to killing living beings. 
$Venerable friends, I abstained from taking what was not given, having $abandoned taking what was not given.

$Venerable friends, I abstained from false speech, having abandoned $false speech. 
I spoke the truth, delighting in the truth, unshakably established $89$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$in the truth, being completely trustworthy, not deceiving [anyone in] the $world. 
I purified my mind with regard to false speech. 
$Venerable friends, I abstained from divisive speech, having abandoned $divisive speech. 
I did not engage in speech that was divisive and that $would harm others. 
Hearing something from this person, I did not tell it $to that person in order to harm this person; hearing something from that $person, I did not tell it to this person in order to harm that person. 
I wished $to unite those that were divided, delighting in their unity. 
I did not create $factions, did not delight in or praise factions. 
I purified my mind with $regard to divisive speech. 
$Venerable friends, I abstained from harsh speech, having abandoned $harsh speech. 
Whatever speech there is that is rough and rude in tone, $that sounds offensive and grates on the ear, that people neither enjoy nor $desire, that causes others suffering and vexation, and that does not lead $to calmness—such speech I had abandoned. 
Whatever speech there is that $is pure, peaceful, gentle, and beneficial, that is pleasant to the ear and $[easily] enters the mind, that is enjoyable and desirable, that gives others $happiness, speech endowed with meaning, that does not make others $afraid, and that leads to calmness in others—such [kinds of] speech I $spoke. 
I purified my mind with regard to harsh speech. 
$Venerable friends, I abstained from frivolous speech, having abandoned $frivolous speech. 
I spoke at the [proper] time, I spoke what is true, what $is Dharma, what is meaningful, what is peaceful. 
Delighting in speech $that is peaceful and of the type that is at the proper time and in the proper $way, I would teach well and admonish well. 
I purified my mind with $regard to frivolous speech. 
$Venerable friends, I abstained from earning profits, having abandoned $earning profits. 
I had discarded weights and measures and did not accept $goods [on commission], I did not bind people [with debts], I did not try $to cheat with measures, nor did I deceive others for the sake of some small $profit. 
I purified my mind with regard to earning profits.

I took a single meal [each day], not eating at night, $training in eating [only] at the [proper] time. 
I purified my mind with $regard to eating after noon. 
$Venerable friends, having accomplished this noble aggregate of virtue, $I further trained in supreme contentment, taking robes [only] to cover my $body, taking [only enough] food to sustain the physical body. 
Wherever $I went, I took [just] robes and bowl with me, without concern or longing. 
$Just as a wild goose flies through the air with [only] its two wings, ven￾erable friends, I was like that, wherever I went, taking [just] robes and $bowl with me, without concern or longing. 
$Venerable friends, having accomplished this noble aggregate of virtue $and this supreme contentment, I further trained in guarding the senses. 
$Always mindful of stopping thoughts of desire, with clear understanding, $successfully guarding the mind through mindfulness, I constantly aroused $right comprehension. 
On seeing a form with the eyes I did not grasp at $its appearance, nor did I savor the form. 
That is to say, for the sake of $restraint I guarded the eye faculty so that no covetousness or sorrow, evil $and unwholesome states, would arise in the mind. 
To that end I guarded $the eye faculty. 
$In the same way, on [hearing a sound] with the ears, ...

To that end I guarded the mind faculty. 
$Venerable friends, having accomplished this noble aggregate of virtue, $this supreme contentment, and this guarding of the senses, I further trained $in right comprehension when going out or coming in, contemplating and $distinguishing well when bending or stretching [my limbs], when lowering $or raising [my head]; with orderly manner and appearance, I properly car￾ried the outer robe, the other robes, and the bowl; when walking, standing, $sitting, and reclining, when going to sleep or waking up, when speaking $or keeping silent, I always had right comprehension. 
$92$Division 7$Venerable friends, having accomplished this noble aggregate of virtue, $this supreme contentment, this guarding of the senses, and this right com￾prehension when going out or coming in, I further trained in dwelling $alone in seclusion. 
I stayed in a forest area, or at the base of a tree in an $empty peaceful place, in a mountain cave, on a heap of straw in an open $place, in the midst of a forest, or in a cemetery. 
$Venerable friends, staying in a forest, or having gone to the base of a $tree in an empty peaceful place, I spread out my sitting mat and sat down $cross-legged, body erect. 
With right mental aspiration and undivided mind￾fulness, I abandoned and removed covetousness. 
With my mind free from $agitation, on seeing others’ wealth and requisites of living, I did not give $rise to covetousness, did not wish “May I get it!” I purified my mind with $regard to covetousness.

$Venerable friends, having thus attained concentration, with a mind $purified and without defilement, without affliction, malleable, well steadied, $with a mind that had attained imperturbability, I trained in the realization $of supernormal powers. 
$Venerable friends, I attained immeasurable supernormal powers—$namely, being one, I became many; being many, I became one [again]. 
$Being one, I remained one, possessed of knowledge and vision. 
I passed $unhindered through stone walls as if passing through space. 
I dived into $the earth as if it were water; I walked on water as if it were earth. 
Seated $cross-legged, I ascended into space like a bird. 
With my hand I touched $and stroked the sun and the moon, which are of such great supernormal $power, such great and mighty virtue, such great merit, such great divine $might. 
With my [mental] body I reached as far as the Brahmā world. 
$Venerable friends, having attained concentration in this way, with a $mind that is purified and without defilement, without affliction, malleable, $93^taisho553b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$well steadied, a mind that has attained imperturbability, I trained in and $realized the supernormal knowledge of the divine ear.

$Venerable friends, having attained concentration in this way, with a $mind purified and without defilement, without affliction, malleable, well $steadied, with a mind that has attained imperturbability, I trained in and $realized the supernormal knowledge of the minds of others. 
$Venerable friends, through the knowledge of the minds of others I knew $the minds of others as they really are: how other beings think, intend, do, $and act.

$Venerable friends, having attained concentration in this way, with a $mind purified and without defilement, without affliction, malleable, well $steadied, with a mind that had attained imperturbability, I trained in and $realized the supernormal knowledge of recollection of past lives. 
$Venerable friends, I recalled countless lives I had traversed in the past, $with their activities and appearances: one birth, two births, a hundred $births, a thousand births, eons of [world] contraction, eons of [world] $expansion, countless eons of [world] contraction and expansion. 
$[I recalled:] “[I was] that living being named So-and-so; in that former $life I went through those experiences; I was [once] born there, with this $family name and this given name; I had this type of life and this type of $food and drink; I experienced this type of pleasure and pain; my life span $was like this, I survived this long, and my life ended like this. 
Dying here, $I was reborn there; dying there, I was reborn here. 
I was reborn here with $this family name and this given name; I had this type of life and this type $of food and drink; I experienced this type of pleasure and pain; my life $span was like this, I survived this long, and my life ended like this.” $94^taisho553c Division 7$Venerable friends, having attained concentration in this way, with a $mind purified and without defilement, without affliction, malleable, well $steadied, with a mind that had attained imperturbability, I trained in and $realized the supernormal knowledge of birth and death. 
$Venerable friends, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses $human [vision], I saw beings as they died and were reborn. 
[I saw them $reborn] as handsome or ugly, superior or inferior, coming and going $between good and bad realms of existence, in accordance with the [pre￾vious] deeds of those living beings. 
This I saw as it really is. 
$If these living beings engaged in evil bodily conduct, evil verbal and $mental conduct; if they reviled noble ones, held wrong views, and per￾formed actions [based on] wrong views, then because of these causes and $conditions, at the breaking up of the body after death, [they] certainly go $to a bad realm of existence, being reborn in hell. 
$If, [however,] these living beings engaged in good bodily conduct, $good verbal and mental conduct, if they did not revile noble ones, held $right views, and performed actions [based on] right views, then because $of these causes and conditions, at the breaking up of the body after death, $[they] certainly go to a good realm of existence, ascending to be reborn $in heaven. 
$Venerable friends, having attained concentration in this way, with a $mind purified and without defilement, without affliction, malleable, well $steadied, with a mind that had attained imperturbability, I trained in and $realized the supernormal knowledge of the destruction of the taints. 
$Venerable friends, I knew dukkha as it really is, knew the arising of $dukkha, ...
knew the cessation of dukkha, ...
and knew the path to the $cessation of dukkha, as it really is. 
I knew the taints as they really are, $knew the arising of the taints, ...
knew the cessation of the taints, ...
and $knew the path to the cessation of the taints as it really is. 
Knowing like $this, seeing like this, my mind was liberated from the taint of sensual $desire, from the taint of existence and from the taint of ignorance. 
It being $liberated, I knew it was liberated. 
I understood as it really is: “Birth has $been ended; the holy life has been established; what had to be done has $been done; there will not be another experiencing of existence.” $95$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Venerable friends, if a monk transgresses against the precepts, breaks $the precepts, falls short of the precepts, violates the precepts, defiles the $precepts, blackens the precepts; and if relying on the precepts, established $in the precepts, using the precepts as his ladder he wishes to ascend to $the hall of unsurpassable wisdom, to the pavilion of the true Dharma, that $is impossible. 
$Venerable friends, it is as if not far from a village there is a viewing $tower surmounted by a pavilion, and inside the tower a ladder with ten $or twelve rungs had been set up. 
If a person comes along wanting to ascend $to that pavilion, then if he does not mount the first rung of the ladder, $desiring instead to [directly] mount the second rung, that is impossible.

$However, we have for a long time known, in our minds, the mind of $Venerable Anuruddha—namely that Venerable Anuruddha is of great super￾normal power, great and mighty virtue, great merit, great divine might. 
$By then the World-honored One’s affliction had ceased and he was at $ease, so he rose and sat cross-legged. 
Having sat up, the World-honored One $praised Venerable Anuruddha: $It is well, it is well, Anuruddha! It is excellent, Anuruddha, how you have $addressed the monks on the nature of the cloth for robes [and of the one $who will wear it]. 
Anuruddha, address the monks again on the nature of $the cloth for robes [and of the one who will wear it]! Anuruddha, address $the monks frequently on the nature of the cloth for robes [and of the one $who will wear it]! $Then the World-honored One said to the monks: $Monks, receive the [teaching] on the nature of the cloth for robes [and of $the one who will wear it]! Recite the [teaching] on the nature of the cloth $for robes [and of the one who will wear it]! Bear well in mind the [teaching] $on the nature of the cloth for robes [and of the one who will wear it]! Why $is that? The [teaching] on the nature of the cloth for robes [and of the one $who will wear it] is connected with the Dharma. 
This is a basis of the holy $98^taisho554b Division 7$life, which leads to attainment, which leads to awakening, which leads to $nirvana. 
A clansman who has shaved off his beard and hair, donned the yel￾low robes, and out of faith left home life, becoming homeless to train in $the path, should attentively receive the [teaching] on the nature of the cloth $for robes [and of the one who will wear it] and bear them well in mind. 
$Why is that? Because I do not see any monk in the past for whom such $a robe was made who was like the monk Anuruddha. 
Nor do I see in the $future or at present any monk for whom such a robe will be made or is being $made, as it is for the monk Anuruddha. 
Why is that? Because now on this $mountain crag with sāla trees there are eight hundred monks sitting together $with the World-honored One in their midst, to make robes for Venerable $Anuruddha. 
In this respect, the monk Anuruddha is of great supernormal $power, of great and mighty virtue, of great merit, of great divine might. 
$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, Venerable $Anuruddha and the [other] monks were delighted and received it respectfully.

^ck The Discourse on $Mindfulness of the Body88$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha, who was wandering in Aṅga $country with a great company of monks, went toward Āpaṇa, the dwelling￾place of Keṇiya [the fire-worshiper]. 
$Then, when the night was over, at dawn, the World-honored One put on $his robes, took his bowl, and entered Āpaṇa to beg for almsfood. 
After having $partaken of the midday meal, he put away his robes and bowl, washed his $hands and feet, put his sitting mat over his shoulder, and went into a forest. 
$Entering the forest, he went to the base of a tree, spread his sitting mat, and $sat down cross-legged. 
$At that time, after the midday meal, many monks were sitting together in $the assembly hall discussing this topic: $Venerable friends, it is marvelous, it is very special how the World-honored $One has explained the cultivation of mindfulness of the body, making $much of it by thorough knowledge, thorough contemplation, thorough $cultivation, and thoroughly guarding it, as something with which to be $well endowed, to be practiced well with a unified mind. 
The Buddha has $99^taisho554c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$declared such mindfulness of the body to bring great fruits: the gaining $of vision and the possession of the vision that sees the highest benefit. 
$At that time the World-honored One, sitting in meditation, with the purified $divine ear that surpasses that of human beings, heard the monks sitting $together in the assembly hall after the midday meal, discussing this topic: $Venerable friends, it is marvelous, it is very special how the World-honored $One has explained the cultivation of mindfulness of the body, making $much of it by thorough knowledge, thorough contemplation, thorough $cultivation, and thoroughly guarding it, as something with which to be $well endowed, to be practiced well with a unified mind. 
The Buddha has $declared such mindfulness of the body to bring great fruits: the gaining $of vision and the possession of the vision that sees the highest benefit. 
$Having heard this, in the afternoon the World-honored One rose from $sitting in meditation, approached the assembly hall, and sat before the sangha $of monks on a seat that had been prepared. 
Then the World-honored One $said to the monks, “What topic have you been discussing? For what topic $are you sitting together in the assembly hall?” $Then the monks replied: $World-honored One, we monks have been sitting together in the assembly $hall after the midday meal discussing this topic: “Venerable friends, it is $marvelous, it is very special how the World-honored One has explained $the cultivation of mindfulness of the body, making much of it by thorough $knowledge, thorough contemplation, thorough cultivation, and thoroughly $guarding it, as something with which to be well endowed, to be practiced $well with a unified mind. 
The Buddha has declared such mindfulness of $the body to bring great fruits: the gaining of vision and the possession of $the vision that sees the highest benefit.” $World-honored One, this is the topic that we have been discussing. 
It $is for this topic that we have been sitting together in the assembly hall. 
$The World-honored One said again to the monks, “How did I explain that $the cultivation of mindfulness of the body, making much of it, will bring $great fruits?” $100^taisho555a Division 7$Then, the monks said to the World-honored One: $The World-honored One is the source of the Dharma, the World-honored $One is the master of the Dharma, the Dharma comes from the World-hon￾ored One. 
May he explain it! Having heard it, we will come to know its $meaning fully. 
$The Buddha said, “Listen closely and pay proper attention! I shall explain $its meaning to you.” Then the monks listened to receive instruction. 
$The Buddha said:89$How does a monk cultivate mindfulness of the body? When walking, a $monk knows he is walking; when standing, he knows he is standing; when $sitting, he knows he is sitting; when lying down, he knows he is lying $down; when falling asleep, he knows he is falling asleep; when waking $up, he knows he is waking up; when falling asleep or waking up, he knows $he is falling asleep or waking up.90$In this way a monk, however he acts with his body, he knows it as $[described] above, as it really is. 
In this way, dwelling in a secluded spot, $with a mind free from indolence, practicing energetically, he removes any $defilements from the mind and attains concentration of the mind. 
Having $attained concentration of the mind, he knows [the body] as [described] above, $as it really is. 
This is how a monk cultivates mindfulness of the body.91$Again, a monk cultivates mindfulness of the body [as follows]. 
When $going out and coming in, a monk clearly knows, contemplates, and discerns $[this action] well; when bending or stretching, lowering or raising [any $of his limbs], he does so with appropriate deportment; when wearing his $outer robe and other robes and [carrying his] bowl, he does so properly; $when walking, standing, sitting, lying down, falling asleep, waking up, $speaking, and keeping silent—all [of these activities] he clearly knows.92$In this way a monk, however he acts with his body, he knows it as $[described] above, as it really is.

$101$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Again, a monk cultivates mindfulness of the body [as follows]. 
When $evil and unwholesome thoughts arise, a monk controls, abandons, erad￾icates, and stops them by recollecting wholesome states.93$It is just as a carpenter or a carpenter’s apprentice might apply an inked $string to a piece of wood [to mark a straight line] and then trims the wood $with a sharp adze to make it straight.94 In the same way, when evil unwhole￾some thoughts arise a monk controls, abandons, eradicates, and stops $them by recollecting wholesome states.

$Again, a monk cultivates mindfulness of the body [as follows]. 
With $teeth clenched and tongue pressed against his palate, a monk uses [his $own will-power] to control his mind, to control, abandon, eradicate, and $stop [evil thoughts]. 
$It is just as two strong men might seize a weak man and, turning him this $way and that, beat him up as they wish.

When $breathing in long, he knows he is breathing in long; when breathing out $long, he knows he is breathing out long. 
When breathing in short, he $knows he is breathing in short; when breathing out short, he knows he is $breathing out short. 
$102^taisho555b Division 7$He trains [in experiencing] the whole body when breathing in; he trains $[in experiencing] the whole body when breathing out.

$Again, a monk cultivates mindfulness of the body [as follows]. 
A monk $completely drenches and pervades his body with rapture and pleasure $born of seclusion [experienced in the first absorption], so that there is no $part within his body that is not pervaded by rapture and pleasure born of $seclusion.96$It is just as when a bath attendant, having filled a vessel with bathing $powder, mixes it with water and kneads it so that no part [of the powder] $is not completely drenched and pervaded with water.

Why is that? Because [the pot] is $[already] full of water, standing firmly upright on the ground, so it will $certainly not accommodate [any more water].

A monk is able to bear hunger and thirst, cold and heat, mosquitoes, $gadflies, flies, fleas, being assailed by wind and sun, being verbally abused, $and being beaten with sticks—he is able to endure [all of this]. 
[Even if] $his body suffers disease causing such extreme pain that his life is coming $to an end—whatever is unpleasant, he is able to endure it all. 
This is reck￾oned the first benefit of cultivating mindfulness of the body like this, mak￾ing much of it like this. 
$Again, a monk is able to tolerate discontent; if discontent arises his $mind does not become stuck in it. 
This is reckoned the second benefit of $cultivating mindfulness of the body like this, making much of it like this. 
$Again, a monk is able to tolerate fear; if fear arises his mind does not $become stuck in it. 
This is reckoned the third benefit of cultivating mind￾fulness of the body like this, making much of it like this. 
$112^taisho557b Division 7$Again, in a monk the three [kinds of] unwholesome thoughts may $arise—thoughts of desire, thoughts of anger, and thoughts of harming.

^ck The Discourse on [Hearing $the Sound of] Crickets111$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha, in the $Bamboo Grove in the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. 
$At that time, after the midday meal, many monks were sitting together in $the assembly hall for some small matter. 
They wished to settle a matter of $disagreement, namely, to discuss the Dharma and discipline, the teachings $of the Buddha. 
At that time the monk Citta Hatthisāriputta was among the $assembly. 
Then, while many of the monks were discussing the Dharma and $the discipline, the teachings of the Buddha, the monk Citta Hatthisāriputta $kept interrupting without waiting until those monks had finished what they $were saying about the Dharma, being disrespectful and inconsiderately ques￾tioning those highly regarded elder monks. 
$At that time Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita was among the assembly. 
Then Ven￾erable Mahākoṭṭhita said to the monk Citta Hatthisāriputta: $Venerable friend, you should know that when many monks are talking $about the Dharma and discipline, the teachings of the Buddha, you should $not interrupt. 
Only if the monks have completed what they have to say $can you speak. 
You should be respectful and considerate in questioning $the highly regarded elder monks. 
Do not be disrespectful or inconsiderate $in questioning highly regarded elder monks.” $114^taisho558a Division 7$At that time all the close friends of the monk Citta Hatthisāriputta were $among the assembly. 
Then the friends of the monk Citta Hatthisāriputta said $to Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita: $Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita, you should not strongly reprimand the monk $Citta Hatthisāriputta. 
Why is that? The monk Citta Hatthisāriputta is vir￾tuous and learned. 
He may appear to be indolent but he is not conceited. 
$Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita, the monk Citta Hatthisāriputta is capable of $assisting the other monks from time to time [in their discussions]. 
$At this the venerable Mahākoṭṭhita said to the close friends of the monk $Citta Hatthisāriputta: $Venerable friends, one who does not possess the knowledge of the minds $of others cannot arbitrarily declare who is right or wrong. 
Why is that? $There may be a person who, when he is in the presence of the World-honored $One and highly regarded elder companions in the holy life, acts with humility, $with an endearing and reverential manner, well restrained and well controlled. 
$At a later time, however, when he has left the presence of the World-honored $One and the highly regarded elder companions in the holy life, he no longer $acts with humility and with an endearing and reverential manner. 
$He associates much with laypeople,112 makes fun, is conceited, and $engages in various kinds of boisterous talk. 
As he associates much with $laypeople, makes fun, is conceited, and engages in various kinds of bois￾terous talk, desire arises in his mind. 
Desire having arisen in his mind, $the body and the mind become passionate. 
The body and mind being pas￾sionate, he abandons the moral precepts and stops [practicing] the path. 
$Venerable friends, [such a monk] is just like an ox that has entered $another’s field. 
The guardian of the field catches it and ties it up with a rope $or puts it inside a fence. 
Venerable friends, if someone were to say, “This $ox will not again enter another’s field,” would that be correctly spoken? $They replied: $No. 
Why is that? That ox might break or undo the rope with which it is $bound, or it might break or get out of the fence within which it is kept $and again enter another’s field, just as before.

^ck The Discourse on the $Drowsiness of a Highly $Regarded Elder118$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha, who was dwelling among the $Bhaggas, was staying on Crocodile Hill in the Deer Park at Bhesakaḷā Grove. 
$At that time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, who was dwelling in the country $of Magadha, was staying in the village of Kallavāḷamutta. 
Then Venerable $Mahāmoggallāna, while sitting in meditation in a secluded and quiet place, $was drowsing off. 
The World-honored One realized from afar that Venerable $Mahāmoggallāna, sitting in meditation in a secluded and quiet place, was $drowsing off. 
Having realized this, the World-honored One entered an appro￾priate concentration such that, by means of this appropriate concentration, $just as [easily and swiftly] a strong man might bend or stretch his arm, he $disappeared from the Deer Park at Bhesakaḷā Grove on Crocodile Hill among $the Bhaggas and appeared before Venerable Mahāmoggallāna in the village $of Kallavāḷamutta in the country of Magadha. 
$Then the World-honored One emerged from [the state of] concentration $and said, “Mahāmoggallāna, you are stuck in drowsiness. 
Mahāmoggallāna, $you are stuck in drowsiness.” $Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said to the World-honored One, “Yes, indeed, $World-honored One.” $The Buddha said further: $122^taisho559c Division 7$Mahāmoggallāna, whatever [meditation] sign (nimitta) makes you become $stuck in drowsiness, do not develop that sign, do not make much of it. 
In $this way the drowsiness may be overcome. 
$If for some reason your drowsiness is not overcome, Mahāmoggallāna, $you should recite in full the teachings as you have previously heard and $memorized them. 
In this way the drowsiness may be overcome. 
$If for some reason your drowsiness is not overcome, Mahāmoggallāna, $you should explain in full to others the teachings as you have previously $heard and memorized them. 
In this way the drowsiness may be overcome. 
$If for some reason your drowsiness has not been overcome, Mahāmog￾gallāna, you should ponder and reflect in your mind on the teachings as $you have previously heard them and memorized them. 
In this way the $drowsiness may be overcome.119$If for some reason your drowsiness has not been overcome, Mahā -$moggallāna, you should pull on your earlobes with both hands. 
In this $way the drowsiness may be overcome. 
$If for some reason your drowsiness is not overcome, Mahāmoggallāna, $you should bathe your face and eyes with cold water and sprinkle your $body with it. 
In this way the drowsiness may be overcome. 
$If for some reason your drowsiness is not overcome, Mahāmoggallāna, $you should go out of the dwelling, look to the four directions and gaze $up at the constellations. 
In this way the drowsiness may be overcome.120$If for some reason your drowsiness is not overcome, Mahāmoggallāna, $you should go out of the dwelling, go in front of it, and practice walking $meditation out in the open, with your sense faculties guarded and the mind $quietly established within, being perceptive of what is in front and behind. 
$In this way the drowsiness may be overcome. 
$If for some reason your drowsiness is not overcome, Mahāmoggallāna, $you should leave off walking meditation, go to the end of the meditation $path, spread your sitting mat, and sit down cross-legged. 
In this way the $drowsiness may be overcome.121$If for some reason your drowsiness is not overcome, Mahāmoggallāna, $you should go back into the dwelling, fold your outer robe into four and $spread it on the bed, fold the inner robe to use as a pillow, and lie down $on your right side, one foot on the other, arousing the perception of light $123^taisho560a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$in the mind, establishing right mindfulness and right comprehension, con￾stantly with the thought of rising again.122$Mahāmoggallāna, do not indulge in reclining peacefully in bed. 
Do $not desire gain. 
Do not be attached to fame. 
Why is that? I shall tell you $all the conditions with which one should not associate and I shall tell you $[the conditions with which] one should associate.123 Mahāmoggallāna, $what are the conditions of which I say one should not associate with? $Mahāmoggallāna, close association with conditions of the common worldly $way: I say, that one should not associate with such conditions. 
Mahāmog￾gallāna, by close association with conditions of the common worldly way $there will be much talk. 
If there is much talk, there is agitation. 
If there $is agitation, the mind is not at ease. 
Mahāmoggallāna, if the mind is not $at ease, then the mind is bereft of concentration. 
For this reason, Mahā-$moggallāna, I say that one should not associate with these. 
$Mahāmoggallāna, what are the conditions of which I say one should $associate with? Mahāmoggallāna, secluded places: I say that one should $associate with these conditions. 
Beneath trees in mountain forests, empty $and peaceful places, high crags and rocky caves without noise, remote $places free of evil, free of people, places conducive to meditation: Mahā-$moggallāna, I say that one should associate with these conditions. 
$Mahāmoggallāna, if you enter the village to beg for almsfood, you $should do so [with a mind] disenchanted with gain, disenchanted with $offerings and homage. 
Only when your mind has become disenchanted $with gain, offerings, and homage should you enter the village to beg for $almsfood. 
Mahāmoggallāna, do not enter the village to beg for almsfood $with a proud state of mind. 
Why is that? Householder families are busy $with domestic affairs and when a monk comes begging for almsfood, a $householder may not pay attention to him. 
Then the monk thinks, “Who $has spoiled my [relationship] with the householder in this house? Why is $that? When I enter the householder’s house, the householder does not pay $attention [to me].” Because of this sadness arises; because of sadness $there is agitation; because of agitation the mind is not at ease; and because $the mind is not at ease, the mind is bereft of concentration. 
$Mahāmoggallāna, when you teach the Dharma, do not speak in a dis￾putatious way. 
If there is disputation, there will be much talk. 
Because of $124$Division 7$much talk, agitation arises; because of agitation, the mind is not at ease; $and because the mind is not at ease, the mind is bereft of concentration. 
$Mahāmoggallāna, when you teach the Dharma, do not be forceful but $teach the Dharma [unperturbed,] like a lion. 
Mahāmoggallāna, when you $teach the Dharma, teach it humbly; abandon force, extinguish force, $destroy force. 
Teach the Dharma without being forceful, teach the Dharma $[unperturbed,] like a lion. 
Mahāmoggallāna, you should train like this. 
$At that time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna rose from his seat, arranged his $robe to bare one shoulder, extended his joined palms toward the Buddha, $and said, “World-honored One, how does a monk attain the ultimate, the ulti￾mate purity, the ultimate holy life, the ultimate completion of the holy life?” $The World-honored One said:124 $Mahāmoggallāna, if a monk experiences pleasant feelings, painful feelings, $or neutral feelings, he contemplates these feelings as impermanent, he $contemplates their rise and fall, their eradication, their fading away, their $cessation, and their abandonment. 
Having contemplated feelings as imper￾manent, having contemplated their rise and fall, their eradication, their $fading away, their cessation, and their abandonment, he does not cling to $this world; because of not clinging to the world, he is not wearied; because $of not being wearied, he attains final nirvana and he knows as it really is: $“Birth has been ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be $done has been done. 
There will not be another experiencing of existence.” $Mahāmoggallāna, in this way a monk attains the ultimate, the ultimate $purity, the ultimate holy life, the ultimate completion of the holy life. 
$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, Venerable $Mahāmoggallāna was delighted and received it respectfully.

^ck The Discourse on Being $without Thorns125$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Vesālī, in the $Gabled Hall beside the Monkey Pond. 
Well-known virtuous senior elders, $great disciples, such as Cāla, Upacāla, Bhadda, Ariṭṭha, Upariṭṭha, and Yasa $the supremely praised,126 such well-known virtuous senior elders, and great $125^taisho560b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$disciples were also staying at Vesālī in the Gabled Hall beside the Monkey $Pond. 
They were all residing near the Buddha, next to his leaf hut. 
$The Licchavis of Vesālī heard that the World-honored One was staying $at Vesālī in the Gabled Hall beside the Monkey Pond. 
They thought, “Let $us, with our great power and royal might, loudly singing, go out of Vesālī $and approach the Buddha to pay homage.” $Then the well-known virtuous senior elders, the great disciples, heard that $the Licchavis of Vesālī, with their great power and royal might, and loudly $singing, were coming out of Vesālī to approach the Buddha and pay homage. 
$They thought, “Noise is a thorn to absorption. 
The World-honored One has $declared that noise is a thorn to absorption. 
Let us instead go to Gosiṅga $Grove. 
Staying there we will not be disturbed, and will stay secluded and $alone to sit in meditation.” The well-known virtuous senior elders, the great $disciples, went to Gosiṅga Grove. 
There, undisturbed, they stayed secluded $and alone to sit in meditation. 
$At that time the Licchavis of Vesālī, with their great power and royal $might, loudly singing, went out of Vesālī and approached the Buddha to pay $homage.127 Some of the Licchavis of Vesālī paid homage with their heads at $the Buddha’s feet, stepped back, and sat to one side; some exchanged greetings $with the Buddha, stepped back, and sat to one side; some extended their $hands with palms joined toward the Buddha, stepped back, and sat to one $side; and some, seeing the Buddha from afar, remained silent and sat down. 
$Then, when the multitude of Licchavis from Vesālī had all settled down, $the World-honored One taught them the Dharma. 
He exhorted and inspired $them, fully delighting them, teaching the Dharma with countless skillful $means. 
Having exhorted and inspired them, and fully delighted them, he $became silent. 
Then the multitude of Licchavis from Vesālī, having been $taught the Dharma by the World-honored One, having been exhorted, inspired, $and fully delighted, rose from their seats, paid homage with their heads at $the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and left. 
$Soon after the Licchavis from Vesālī had left, the World-honored One $asked the monks, “Where have the senior elders, the great disciples, gone?” $The monks replied: $World-honored One, the senior elders, the great disciples, heard that the $Licchavis of Vesālī, with their great power and royal might, loudly singing, $126^taisho560c Division 7$were coming out of Vesālī to approach the Buddha and pay homage. 
They $thought, “Noise is a thorn to absorption. 
The World-honored One has $declared that noise is a thorn to absorption. 
Let us instead go to Gosiṅga $Grove. 
Staying there we will not be disturbed, and will stay secluded and $alone to sit in meditation.” The World-honored One, the senior elders, the $great disciples, all went there together. 
$On hearing this, the World-honored One praised them, saying: $It is well, it is well that the senior elders, the great disciples, should speak $like this: “Noise is a thorn to absorption. 
The World-honored One has $declared that noise is a thorn to absorption.” Why is that? I do indeed $speak like this. 
[Noise is indeed] a thorn to absorption. 
$To one who is keeping morality, breaches of morality are a thorn; to $one guarding the senses, bodily adornments are a thorn; to one cultivating $[the perception] of foulness, an appearance of purity is a thorn; to one $cultivating loving-kindness, anger is a thorn; to one abstaining from liquor, $drinking liquor is a thorn; to one leading a celibate life, looking at the $female form is a thorn; to one entering the first absorption, noise is a thorn; $to one entering the second absorption, [directed] awareness and [sustained] $contemplation (vitakka-vicāra) is a thorn; to one entering the third absorp￾tion, rapture is a thorn; to one entering the fourth absorption, the inhalations $and exhalations are a thorn; to one entering the sphere of [boundless] $space, the perception of form is a thorn; to one entering the sphere of $[boundless] consciousness, the perception of the sphere of [boundless] $space is a thorn; to one entering the sphere of nothingness, the perception $of the sphere of [boundless] consciousness is a thorn; to one entering the $sphere of [neither-perception-nor-]nonperception, the perception of the $sphere of nothingness is a thorn; to one entering the concentration by the $cessation of perception and knowing, perception and knowing are a thorn.128$Again, there are three thorns: the thorn of desire, the thorn of anger, $and the thorn of ignorance. 
An arahant, who has eradicated the taints has $already cut off these three thorns, knows that they have been pulled out $by the root and destroyed so that they will not arise again. 
That is, an ara￾hant is without thorns; an arahant is separated from thorns; [thus] an $arahant is without thorns and separated from thorns.

Listen $closely, listen closely and pay careful attention!” Then the monks listened $to receive instruction. 
$The Buddha said: $What is the nature of an untrue person? Suppose that a certain person who $has gone forth to practice the path is from a high family, whereas others $are not like that. 
Because he is from a high family, he praises himself and $looks down on others. 
This is the nature of an untrue person.130$One who has the nature of a true person reflects like this: “It is not $because I am from a high family that I eradicate sensual passion, anger, $and delusion.

They have repugnance toward it, $as the perception of impurity has arisen in them. 
They say, “Take away $those feces! Take away those feces!”151 That person, having carried the $bowl to a certain location, lifts the lid and reveals [the contents].

They $experience desire and relishing. 
They no longer experience repugnance $toward it, as the perception of purity has arisen in them. 
Even those who $are not hungry want to eat it, not to mention those who are hungry. 
$In the same way, venerable friend, so long as his wise companions in $the holy life have not come to know of the countless wholesome mental $aspirations that arise in him in this way, that person, [despite] being a $renunciant, is perceived as not a renunciant. 
Being a wise renunciant he $is perceived as not a wise renunciant. 
[Possessing] right comprehension, $he is perceived as not [possessing] right comprehension. 
[Possessing] $164^taisho569b Division 8$right mindfulness, he is perceived as not [possessing] right mindfulness. 
$Being purified, he is perceived as not purified. 
$[But,] venerable friend, when his wise companions in the holy life do $come to know of the countless wholesome mental aspirations that arise $in him in this way, that person, being a renunciant, is perceived as a renun￾ciant. 
Being a wise renunciant, he is perceived as a wise renunciant. 
[Pos￾sessing] right comprehension, he is perceived as [possessing] right com￾prehension. 
[Possessing] right mindfulness, he is perceived as [possessing] $right mindfulness. 
Being purified, he is perceived as purified. 
$Venerable friend, it should be known that such a person is to be asso￾ciated with and to be respected. 
If monks associate with someone who $should be associated with, or respect someone who should be respected, $then they will for a long time be able to attain profit and benefit, and will $secure their own well-being. 
They will find security and happiness, and $be free of suffering, sorrow, and grief. 
$At that time, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was in the assembly. 
The ven￾erable Mahāmoggallāna said, “Venerable Sāriputta, I would like to tell a $simile in relation to this topic. 
Am I permitted to tell it?” $Venerable Sāriputta said, “Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, please tell the $simile you wish to tell.” $Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said: $Venerable Sāriputta, I recall that on one occasion I was dwelling on Mount $Vulture Peak at Rājagaha. 
At that time, when the night was over, toward $dawn, I put on my robes, took my bowl, entered Rājagaha, and went to $beg alms. 
I approached the house of the naked ascetic Puṇṇaputta, a former $cartwright.152$At that time, at a neighboring house, another cartwright was planing $a felloe for a cart. 
Just then the naked ascetic Puṇṇaputta, the former $cartwright, arrived at that house. 
Seeing that [other cartwright] planing a $felloe, the naked ascetic Puṇṇaputta, the former cartwright, had this $thought: “If this cartwright uses his adze to plane the felloe by cutting off $this and that defect, in this way that felloe will become excellent.” $Then, just as if he knew the thought in the mind of the naked ascetic $Puṇṇaputta, the cartwright took his adze and cut off this and that defect. 
$165$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Then the naked ascetic Puṇṇaputta was overjoyed and said, “Cartwright, $it is as if you knew my mind with your mind. 
Why is that? Because you $used your adze to plane that felloe by cutting off this and that defect, just $as I was thinking you could.” $In the same way, Venerable Sāriputta, suppose there are those who are $flattering, deceitful, envious, lack faith, are negligent, lack right mindfulness $and right comprehension, lack concentration, lack wisdom, are conceited, $deluded, do not guard the sense faculties, do not train in <seclusion>,153$and lack discernment—on account of knowing their minds with his mind, $Venerable Sāriputta has given this teaching. 
$Venerable Sāriputta, there are those who are not flattering, not deceitful, $not envious, who possess faith, are diligent and without sluggishness, $endowed with right mindfulness and right comprehension, who cultivate $concentration and cultivate wisdom, are not conceited or deluded, guard $the sense faculties, train extensively in <seclusion>, and discern skillfully. 
$When they hear the Dharma taught by Venerable Sāriputta, then just like $food for the hungry and drink for the thirsty, [what comes from his] mouth $gets through to their minds. 
$Venerable Sāriputta, suppose a girl from the warrior caste, the brahmin $caste, the merchant caste, or the worker caste, who is beautiful and attrac￾tive, has bathed herself well, anointed her body with perfume, put on $bright and clean clothes, and adorned herself with various jewels.154$Now, suppose a man who thinks [well] of that girl, seeking her benefit, $welfare, peace, and happiness, takes a wreath made of lotuses, a wreath $of champak flowers, a wreath of great-flowered jasmine (sumanā), a $wreath of Arabian jasmine (vassikā), or a wreath of roses and gives it to $that girl. 
That girl will joyously receive [the wreath] with both hands and $place it on her head. 
$It is the same, Venerable Sāriputta, with those who are not flattering, $not deceitful, not envious, who possess faith, are diligent and without $sluggishness, endowed with right mindfulness and right comprehension, $who cultivate concentration and cultivate wisdom, are not conceited or $deluded, guard the sense faculties, train extensively in <seclusion>, and $discern skillfully. 
$166^taisho569c Division 8$When they hear the Dharma taught by Venerable Sāriputta, then just $like food for the hungry and drink for the thirsty, [what comes from his] $mouth gets through to their minds. 
$Venerable Sāriputta, it is extraordinary, it is remarkable! Venerable $Sāriputta so often uplifts and supports his companions in the holy life by $helping them abandon what is unwholesome and establishing them in $what is wholesome. 
$Having praised each other like this, these two venerable ones rose from $their seats and left. 
$Thus spoke Venerable Sāriputta. 
Having heard what Venerable Sāriputta $said, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna and the [other] monks were delighted and $received it respectfully. 
$88. 
^ck The Discourse on the Quest $for the Dharma155$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was traveling in Kosala country $with a great assembly of monks. 
He went to a rosewood grove north of Pañ-$casāla village, along with various renowned and highly regarded elders, chief $disciples such as Venerable Sāriputta, Venerable Mahāmoggalāna, Venerable $Kassapa, Venerable Mahākaccāna, Venerable Anuruddha, Venerable Revata, $and Venerable Ānanda. 
Such renowned and highly regarded elders, such $chief disciples were dwelling next to the Buddha’s thatched hut [north of] $Pañcasāla village.156$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $You should be on a quest for the Dharma, not on a quest for food and $drink.157 Why is that? Out of loving-kindness and compassion for my dis￾ciples, I wish you to be on a quest for the Dharma, not on a quest for food $and drink. 
$If you are not on a quest for the Dharma and are on a quest for food $and drink, then you will disgrace yourselves and [as your teacher] I will $also not have a good reputation. 
If you are on a quest for the Dharma and $not on a quest for food and drink, then you will dignify yourselves and $[as your teacher] I will also have a good reputation. 
$167^taisho570a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$How are disciples who practice under the Buddha on a quest for food $and drink and not on a quest for the Dharma? Suppose that I have had my $fill, having finished eating my meal, and there is still some food left over. 
$Then two monks arrive who are hungry and weak, and I tell them, “I have $had my fill, having finished eating my meal, and there is still some food $left over. 
Take that food if you wish to eat. 
If you do not take it, then I $shall throw it away where there is no greenery or drop it into water where $there is no life.” $Then the first of the two monks thinks to himself, “The World-honored $One has had his fill, having finished eating his meal, and there is still some $food left over. 
If I do not take it, the World-honored One will certainly $throw it away where there is no greenery or drop it into water where there $is no life. 
I would now rather take and eat it.” He then takes the food. 
$Although that monk, having taken the food, passes the day and night $pleasantly and has gained comfort and well-being, yet in taking the food $that monk is not conforming to the Buddha’s intention. 
$Why is that? Because by taking the food that monk does not achieve $having few desires, does not know contentment, is not easily supported, $is not easily satisfied, does not know the [proper] time, does not know $restraint, does not gain energy, does not attain sitting in meditation, does $not attain purity of conduct, does not attain seclusion, does not attain $mental unification, does not attain diligence, and does not attain nirvana. 
$Thus, in taking the food, that monk is not conforming to the Buddha’s $intention. 
This is how disciples practicing under the Buddha are on a quest $for food and drink and not on a quest for the Dharma. 
$How are disciples on a quest for the Dharma and not on a quest for food $and drink? Of those two monks, the second one thinks to himself, “The $World-honored One has had his fill, has finished eating his meal, and there $is still some food left over. 
If I do not take it, the World-honored One will $certainly throw it away where there is no greenery or drop it into water $where there is no life. 
Again, the World-honored One has said that among $[the types of] nutriment this is the most lowly, namely remnants of food. 
$I would now rather not take this food.” Thinking thus, he does not take it. 
$Although that monk, through not taking the food, passes the day and $night in suffering, not having gained comfort and well-being, yet, in not $168^taisho570b Division 8$taking the food, that monk is conforming to the Buddha’s intention. 
Why $is that? $By not taking the food that monk achieves having few desires, knows $contentment, is easily supported, is easily satisfied, knows the [proper] time, $knows restraint, gains energy, attains sitting in meditation, attains purity of $conduct, attains seclusion, attains mental unification, attains diligence, and $attains nirvana. 
Thus, in not taking the food, that monk is conforming to $the Buddha’s intention. 
This is how disciples practicing under the Buddha $are on a quest for the Dharma and not on a quest for food and drink. 
$Then the World-honored One addressed the disciples: $If a teacher of the Dharma and discipline delights in abiding in seclusion $but his senior disciples do not delight in abiding in seclusion, then this $Dharma and discipline is not conducive to the welfare of many people or $the happiness of many people. 
It is not [being practiced] out of compassion $and sympathy for the world, nor for the benefit, welfare, peace, and hap￾piness of devas and human beings.158$If a teacher of the Dharma and discipline delights in abiding in seclusion $but his intermediate ...

It is not [being $practiced] out of compassion and sympathy for the world, nor for the ben￾efit, welfare, peace, and happiness of devas and human beings. 
$[On the other hand,] if a teacher of the Dharma and discipline delights $in abiding in seclusion and his senior disciples also delight in abiding in $seclusion, then this Dharma and discipline are conducive to the welfare $of many people and the happiness of many people. 
It is [being practiced] $out of compassion and sympathy for the world and for the benefit, welfare, $peace, and happiness of devas and human beings.

It is [being practiced] $out of compassion and sympathy for the world and for the benefit, welfare, $peace, and happiness of devas and human beings. 
$169$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$At that time Venerable Sāriputta was present in the assembly. 
Then the $World-honored One said to him: $Sāriputta, for the sake of the monks, deliver a discourse on the Dharma $that accords with the Dharma. 
I am afflicted by a backache and wish to $rest a little.159$Venerable Sāriputta assented to the Buddha’s instruction: “Certainly, $World-honored One.” $Then the World-honored One folded his outer robe in four to serve as a $bed, rolled his main robe into a pillow, and lay down on his right side with $one foot on the other, maintaining the perception of light, mindful and atten￾tive, and always keeping in mind the intention of getting up again. 
$Then Venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks: $Venerable friends, you should know that the World-honored One has given $this teaching in brief: “If a teacher of the Dharma and discipline delights $in abiding in seclusion but his senior disciples do not delight in abiding $in seclusion, then this Dharma and discipline will not be conducive to the $welfare of many people or the happiness of many people. 
It is not [being $practiced] out of compassion and sympathy for the world, nor for the ben￾efit, welfare, peace, and happiness of devas and human beings. 
$“If a teacher of the Dharma and discipline delights in abiding in seclu￾sion but his intermediate ...

It is [being practiced] $out of compassion and sympathy for the world and for the benefit, welfare, $peace, and happiness of devas and human beings.” $Regarding this teaching given so briefly by the World-honored One, $how do you understand its meaning? How would you elaborate on it and $analyze it?160$Then one monk in the assembly said: $Venerable Sāriputta, here a highly regarded elder declares about himself, $“I have attained final knowledge: Birth has been ended for me, the holy $life is established, what had to be done has been done, there will not be $another experiencing of existence; I know this as it really is.”’ Upon $hearing that monk’s self-declaration of his attainment of final knowledge, $his companions in the holy life are filled with joy. 
$Another monk said: $Venerable Sāriputta, when intermediate and new disciples are on the quest $for unsurpassable nirvana and aspire to it, their companions in the holy $life are delighted on seeing that. 
$In these ways those monks explained the meaning, but it did not accord $with what Venerable Sāriputta had in mind. 
$Venerable Sāriputta addressed those monks: $Venerable friends, listen to what I shall say to you. 
If a teacher of the $Dharma and discipline delights in abiding in seclusion, but his senior dis￾ciples do not delight in abiding in seclusion, then his senior disciples are $to be reproached for three reasons. 
What are the three? $[If] the teacher delights in seclusion but his senior disciples do not $train in <seclusion>,$161 then his senior disciples are to be reproached for $this.

$Venerable Sāriputta said further to the monks: $Venerable friends, there is a middle way for the attainment of mental sta￾bility, the attainment of concentration, and the attainment of bliss, which $conforms to the Dharma and is in accordance with the Dharma, and which $leads to penetration, awakening, and nirvana. 
$Venerable friends, what is the middle way for the attainment of mental $stability, the attainment of concentration, and the attainment of bliss, $which conforms to the Dharma and is in accordance with the Dharma, $and which leads to penetration, awakening, and nirvana? $Venerable friends, thoughts of sensual desire are evil, and the vice of $thoughts of sensual desire is also evil. 
One [should] abandon thoughts of $sensual desire and the vice of thoughts of sensual desire.

And what, venerable $friends, is this middle way for the attainment of mental stability, the attain￾ment of concentration, and the attainment of bliss, which conforms to the $Dharma, is in accordance with the Dharma, and leads to penetration, awak￾ening, and nirvana? $It is the noble eightfold path: right view ...

Venerable friends, this is the middle way for the attain￾ment of mental stability, the attainment of concentration, and the attainment $of bliss, which conforms to the Dharma and is in accordance with the $Dharma, and leads to penetration, awakening, and nirvana. 
$By then the pain afflicting the World-honored One had dissipated and he $was at ease and comfortable.162 Rising from his reclining position, he sat $cross-legged and praised Venerable Sāriputta: $It is well, it is well, Sāriputta, you have given the monks a discourse on $the Dharma that accords with the Dharma. 
Sāriputta, you should continue $to explain to the monks the Dharma that accords with the Dharma. 
Sāri -$putta, you should frequently explain to the monks the Dharma that accords $with the Dharma. 
$Then the World-honored One addressed the monks: $You should all remember [this discourse on] the Dharma that accords $with the Dharma, recite it and commit it to memory. 
Why is that? $[This discourse on] the Dharma accords with the Dharma; it contains $the Dharma and is meaningful; it is the basis of the holy life, leading to $penetration, awakening, and nirvana.

$Venerable friends, a monk will ensure much benefit for himself if he $contemplates like this: “Do I have evil desires and thoughts [based on $such] desires, or do I not have evil desires and thoughts [based on such] $desires?” Venerable friends, when contemplating [like this], if a monk $finds that he does have evil desires and thoughts [based on such] desires, $then he is not delighted and seeks to abandon them.

$At that time, in the afternoon, Venerable Mahācunda emerged from sitting $in meditation and approached the Buddha. 
Having paid homage at the $Buddha’s feet, he stepped back, sat to one side, and said: $World-honored One, regarding the various views that keep arising in the $world—speculations about the existence of a self, of living beings, of $human beings, of a soul, of a life-substratum, and of the world—World￾honored One, in what way should one know and in what way should one $see so that these views are eradicated and abandoned, and other views are $not perpetuated and clung to? $The World-honored One said: $Cunda, regarding the various views that keep arising in the world—spec￾ulations about the existence of a self, of living beings, of human beings, $of a soul, of a life-substratum, and of the world—if, Cunda, [one realizes] $the remainderless cessation of all phenomena, [then] knowing like this $and seeing like this, these views are eradicated and abandoned, and other $183$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$views are not perpetuated and clung to. 
[For this purpose] one should $train in effacement.

dwells having attained the fourth absorption. 
He $[might] think, “I am abiding in effacement.” $But, Cunda, in the noble Dharma and discipline these four higher states $of mind do not yet constitute “effacement.” They are “pleasant abidings $here and now.” As a practitioner emerges from [these absorptions] and $enters them again, he [might] think, “I am abiding in effacement.” But, $Cunda, in the noble Dharma and discipline these do not yet constitute $“effacement.” $A monk, with the complete transcending of perceptions of form ...

$What are states that are extinguished by the body and not extinguished $by speech? Here a monk is filled with unwholesome bodily action, $endowed with it and maintaining it, adhering to it bodily. 
Having seen $this, other monks admonish that monk, “Venerable friend, you are filled $with unwholesome bodily action, endowed with it and maintaining it. 
$Why do you adhere to it bodily? Venerable friend, you should abandon $unwholesome bodily action and cultivate wholesome bodily action.” At $a later time that person abandons unwholesome bodily action and cultivates $wholesome bodily action.

How should we remember it?” $The World-honored One said, “Ānanda, this discourse is called the ‘Sim￾ile of the Blue and White Lotuses.’ This is how you should remember and $recite it.” $Then the World-honored One addressed all the monks: $190^taisho575a Division 8$You should together remember this “Discourse on the Simile of the Blue $and White Lotuses,” recite it, and commit it to memory. 
Why is that? This $“Discourse on the Simile of the Blue and White Lotuses” accords with $the Dharma and is conducive for benefit. 
It is a basis for the holy life, $leading to penetration, awakening, and nirvana. 
$Clansmen who have shaved off their hair and beards, donned the yellow $robe, and out of faith given up the household life to become homeless $and train in the path should memorize this “Discourse on the Simile of $the Blue and White Lotuses,” reciting it and retaining it well.

$Then the brahmin said to the World-honored One, “Gotama, you should $go to the Bāhukā River to bathe.” $The World-honored One asked, “Brahmin, what do people gain from $bathing in the Bāhukā River?” $The brahmin replied: $Gotama, bathing in the Bāhukā River is a sign of religious purification in $the world, a sign of deliverance, a sign of merit. 
Gotama, one who bathes $in the Bāhukā River thereby becomes purified and eliminates all evil. 
$The World-honored One then spoke to the brahmin in verse: $Brahmin Sundarika, $Entering the Bāhukā River $Is a common recreation of fools, $Which cannot purify dark deeds. 
$194$Division 8$Sundarika, of what use is going to springs? $Of what benefit is the Bāhukā River? $If a person performs unwholesome deeds, $What good does clean water do him? $A pure person has no stains and defilements; $A pure person always speaks of morality. 
$A pure person’s clean bright deeds $Always lead to pure conduct. 
$If you do not kill living beings, $Always abstain from taking what is not given, $Speak the truth, do not speak lies, $Always have right mindfulness and right comprehension, $Then, brahmin, training in this way, $All living beings are at peace. 
$Brahmin, why return home [to bathe]? $The spring at home purifies no one. 
$Brahmin, you should train $In purification through wholesome teachings. 
$What need have you of lowly water, $Which removes only bodily filth? $The brahmin said to the Buddha, “I also think in this way. 
I shall purify $myself through wholesome teachings. 
What need have I of lowly water?” $Hearing what the Buddha taught, the brahmin was greatly gladdened in $mind. 
He paid homage at the Buddha’s feet, and took refuge in the Buddha, $Dharma, and Sangha. 
The brahmin said: $World-honored One, I have understood. 
Well-gone One, I have comprehended. 
$I now personally take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. 
$May the World-honored One accept me as a male lay disciple from this day $forward until the end of life.

In the $same way, venerable friends, a monk, wishing to maintain these wholesome $states, wishing not to lose them, not to regress but to develop them further, $will quickly seek the means to train with great diligence, with right mind￾fulness and right comprehension, persevering in order not to regress.196$Thus spoke Venerable Sāriputta. 
Having heard what Venerable Sāriputta $said, the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.$204$Division 9 $On Causality $97. 
^ck The Great Discourse $on Causality197$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying among the Kurus, 578b at a Kuru town called Kammāsadhamma. 
$At that time Venerable Ānanda, while sitting in meditation alone and in $seclusion, had this thought, “This dependent arising is wonderful. 
It is very $profound and also appears profound; yet on contemplating it, I see it as very $easy, very easy [to understand].” $Then in the late afternoon Venerable Ānanda rose from his meditation $and approached the Buddha. 
He paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s $feet, stood back to one side, and said: $World-honored One, while sitting in meditation alone and in seclusion, I $had this thought: “This dependent arising is wonderful. 
It is very profound $and appears profound; yet on contemplating it, I see it as very easy, very $easy [to understand].” $The World-honored One said: $Ānanda, do not think like that: “This dependent arising is very easy, very $easy [to understand]”! Why is that? This dependent arising is very profound $and appears profound. 
$Ānanda, through not knowing dependent arising as it really is, not $seeing it as it really is, not realizing it, not penetrating it, living beings $are like a jammed loom,198 [or] like a thoroughly tangled mass of creepers, $hurriedly and clamorously coming and going from this world to that world $and from that world to this world, unable to transcend birth and death. 
$Therefore, Ānanda, realize that this dependent arising is very profound $and appears profound. 
$205$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Ānanda, if one is asked “Is there a condition for old age and death?” $then one should answer “There is a condition for old age and death”; and $if one is asked “What is the condition for old age and death?” then one $should answer “Birth is the condition.” $Ānanda, if one is asked “Is there a condition for birth?” then one should $answer “There is a condition for birth”; and if one is asked “What is the $condition for birth?” then one should answer “Becoming is the condition.” $Ānanda, if one is asked “Is there a condition for becoming?” then one $should answer “There is a condition for becoming”; and if one is asked $“What is the condition for becoming?” then one should answer “Clinging $is the condition.” $Ānanda, if one is asked “Is there a condition for clinging?” then one $should answer “There is a condition for clinging”; and if one is asked $“What is the condition for clinging?” then one should answer “Craving $is the condition.”199$Thus, Ānanda, conditioned by craving there is clinging, conditioned $by clinging there is becoming, conditioned by becoming there is birth, $conditioned by birth there are old age and death, conditioned by old age $and death there are worry and woe, weeping and tears, sorrow and pain, $distress and vexation—all these exist conditioned by old age and death. 
$In this way this entire great mass of dukkha arises. 
$Ānanda, conditioned by birth there are old age and death. 
[Regarding] $this statement, “conditioned by birth there are old age and death,” it should $be understood what is meant by saying, “conditioned by birth there are $old age and death.” $Ānanda, if there were no births of fish to the species of fish, of birds $to the species of birds, of serpents to the species of serpents,200 of nāgas $to the species of nāgas, of spirits to the species of spirits, of demons to $the species of demons, of devas to the species of devas, of human beings $to the species of human beings;201 Ānanda, if there were no births of the $various living beings in their various places, not a single instance of birth—$supposing that birth were absent, would there be old age and death? $[Ānanda] answered, “There would not.” $[The Buddha said:] $206^taisho578c Division 9$Ānanda, for this reason it should be understood that this is the cause of $old age and death, the source of old age and death, the origin of old age $and death, the condition for old age and death, namely birth. 
Why is that? $Because conditioned by birth there are old age and death. 
$Ānanda, conditioned by becoming there is birth. 
[Regarding] this state￾ment, “conditioned by becoming there is birth,” it should be understood $what is meant by saying “conditioned by becoming there is birth.” $Ānanda, if there were no becoming of fish to the species of fish, of $birds to the species of birds, of serpents to the species of serpents, of nāgas $to the species of nāgas, of spirits to the species of spirits, of demons to $the species of demons, of devas to the species of devas, of human beings $to the species of human beings;202 Ānanda, if there were no becoming of $the various living beings in their various places, not a single instance of $becoming—supposing that becoming were absent, would there be birth? $[Ānanda] answered, “There would not.” $[The Buddha said:] $Ānanda, for this reason it should be understood that this is the cause of $birth, the source of birth, the origin of birth, the condition for birth, namely $becoming. 
Why is that? Because conditioned by becoming there is birth. 
$Ānanda, conditioned by clinging there is becoming. 
[Regarding] this $statement, “conditioned by clinging there is becoming,” it should be $understood what is meant by saying “conditioned by clinging there is $becoming.” $Ānanda, if there were no clinging, not a single instance of clinging; $supposing that clinging were absent,203 would there be becoming or the $concept of becoming? $[Ānanda] answered, “There would not.” $[The Buddha said:] $Ānanda, for this reason it should be understood that this is the cause of $becoming, the source of becoming, the origin of becoming, the condition $for becoming, namely clinging. 
Why is that? Because conditioned by $clinging there is becoming. 
$207$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Ānanda, conditioned by craving there is clinging. 
[Regarding] this $statement, “conditioned by craving there is clinging,” it should be under￾stood what is meant by saying “conditioned by craving there is clinging.” $Ānanda, if there were no craving, not a single instance of craving; sup￾posing that craving were absent,204 would there be clinging, would clinging $become established? $[Ānanda] answered, “It would not.” $[The Buddha said:] $Ānanda, for this reason it should be understood that this is the cause of $clinging, the source of clinging, the origin of clinging, the condition for $clinging, namely craving. 
Why is that? Because conditioned by craving $there is clinging.205$Ānanda, conditioned by craving there is seeking, conditioned by seeking $there is gain, conditioned by gain there is discrimination, conditioned by $discrimination there is defilement by desire, conditioned by defilement $by desire there is attachment, conditioned by attachment there is miser￾liness, conditioned by miserliness there is storing up, conditioned by $storing up there is protecting [one’s possessions]. 
$Ānanda, conditioned by protecting there is the [taking up of] sword $and club, there is quarreling, flattery, deceit, falsehood, divisive speech, $and the arising of countless evil and unwholesome states. 
In this way this $entire great mass of dukkha arises. 
$Ānanda, if there were no protecting, not a single instance of protecting; $supposing that protecting were absent, would there be the [taking up of] $sword and club, would there be quarreling, flattery, deceit, falsehood, $divisive speech, and the arising of countless evil and unwholesome states? $[Ānanda] answered, “There would not.” $[The Buddha said:] $Ānanda, for this reason it should be understood that this is the cause of $the [taking up of] sword and club, of quarreling, flattery, deceit, falsehood, $divisive speech, of the arising of countless evil and unwholesome states; $this is the source, this is the origin, this is the condition, namely protecting. 
$Why is that? Because conditioned by protecting there is the [taking up $208^taisho579a Division 9$of] sword and club, quarreling, flattery, deceit, falsehood, divisive speech, $the arising of countless evil and unwholesome states. 
In this way this $entire great mass of dukkha arises. 
$Ānanda, conditioned by storing up there is protecting. 
[Regarding] this $statement, “conditioned by storing up there is protecting,” it should be $understood what is meant by saying “conditioned by storing up there is $protecting.” $Ānanda, if there were no storing up, not a single instance of storing $up; supposing that storing up were absent, would there be protecting? $[Ānanda] answered, “There would not.” $[The Buddha said:] $Ānanda, for this reason it should be understood that this is the cause of $protecting, the source of protecting, the origin of protecting, the condition $for protecting, namely storing up. 
Why is that? Because conditioned by $storing up there is protecting. 
$Ānanda, conditioned by miserliness there is storing up. 
[Regarding] $this statement, “conditioned by miserliness there is storing up,” it should $be understood what is meant by saying “conditioned by miserliness there $is storing up.” $Ānanda, if there were no miserliness, not a single instance of miserli￾ness; supposing that miserliness were absent, would there be storing up? $[Ānanda] answered, “There would not.” $[The Buddha said:] $Ānanda, for this reason it should be understood that this is the cause of $storing up, the source of storing up, the origin of storing up, the condition $for storing up, namely miserliness. 
Why is that? Because conditioned by $miserliness there is storing up. 
$Ānanda, conditioned by attachment there is miserliness. 
[Regarding] $this statement, “conditioned by attachment there is miserliness,” it should $be understood what is meant by saying “conditioned by attachment there $is miserliness.” $Ānanda, if there were no attachment, not a single instance of attachment; $supposing that attachment were absent, would there be miserliness? $209$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$[Ānanda] answered, “There would not.” $[The Buddha said:] $Ānanda, for this reason it should be understood that this is the cause of $miserliness, the source of miserliness, the origin of miserliness, the con￾dition for miserliness, namely attachment. 
Why is that? Because condi￾tioned by attachment there is miserliness.

Why is that? Because conditioned by desire $there is attachment. 
$Ānanda, conditioned by discrimination there is defilement by desire. 
$[Regarding] this statement, “conditioned by discrimination there is defile￾ment by desire,” it should be understood what is meant by saying “con￾ditioned by discrimination there is defilement by desire.” $Ānanda, if there were no discrimination, not a single instance of dis￾crimination; supposing that discrimination were absent, would there be $defilement by desire? $[Ānanda] answered, “There would not.” $[The Buddha said:] $Ānanda, for this reason it should be understood that this is the cause of $defilement by desire, the source of defilement by desire, the origin of $defilement by desire, the condition for defilement by desire, namely dis￾crimination. 
Why is that? Because conditioned by discrimination there is $defilement by desire. 
$Ānanda, conditioned by gain there is discrimination. 
[Regarding] this $210^taisho579b Division 9$statement, “conditioned by gain there is discrimination,” it should be $understood what is meant by saying “conditioned by gain there is dis￾crimination.” $Ānanda, if there were no gain, not a single instance of gain; supposing $that gain were absent, would there be discrimination? $[Ānanda] answered, “There would not.” $[The Buddha said:] $Ānanda, for this reason it should be understood that this is the cause of $discrimination, the source of discrimination, the origin of discrimination, $the condition for discrimination, namely gain.

$Ānanda, conditioned by seeking there is gain. 
[Regarding] this state￾ment, “conditioned by seeking there is gain,” it should be understood $what is meant by saying “conditioned by seeking there is gain.” $Ānanda, if there were no seeking, not a single instance of seeking; sup￾posing that seeking were absent, would there be gain? $[Ānanda] answered, “There would not.” $[The Buddha said:] $Ānanda, for this reason it should be understood that this is the cause of $gain, the source of gain, the origin of gain, the condition for gain, namely $seeking. 
Why is that? Because conditioned by seeking there is gain. 
$Ānanda, conditioned by craving there is seeking. 
[Regarding] this state￾ment: “conditioned by craving there is seeking,” it should be understood $what is meant by saying “conditioned by craving there is seeking.” $Ānanda, if there were no craving, not a single instance of craving; sup￾posing that craving were absent, would there be seeking? $[Ānanda] answered, “There would not.” $[The Buddha said:] $Ānanda, for this reason it should be understood that this is the cause of $seeking, the source of seeking, the origin of seeking, the condition for $seeking, namely craving. 
Why is that? Because conditioned by craving $there is seeking. 
$211$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Ānanda, sensual craving and craving for becoming, these two factors $have feeling as their cause, conditioned by feeling they come about. 
$Ānanda, if one is asked “Is there a condition for feeling?” then one $should answer “There is a condition for feeling”; and if one is asked “What $is the condition for feeling?” then one should answer “Contact is the con￾dition.” It should be understood what is meant by saying “conditioned by $contact there is feeling.” $Ānanda, if there were no eye contact, not a single instance of eye con￾tact; supposing that eye contact were absent; would there be the arising $of pleasant feeling, painful feeling, or neutral feeling conditioned by eye $contact? $[Ānanda] answered, “There would not.” $[The Buddha said:] $Ānanda, if there were no ear contact, ...
nose [contact], ...
tongue [con￾tact], ...
body [contact], ...
mind contact, not a single instance of mind $contact; supposing that mind contact were absent, would there be the $arising of pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neutral feeling conditioned $by mind contact? $[Ānanda] answered, “There would not.” $[The Buddha said:] $Ānanda, for this reason it should be understood that this is the cause of $feeling, the source of feeling, the origin of feeling, the condition for feeling, $namely contact. 
Why is that? Because conditioned by contact there is $feeling. 
$Ānanda, if one is asked “Is there a condition for contact?” then one $should answer “There is a condition for contact”; and if one is asked $“What is the condition for contact?” then one should answer “Name-and￾form is the condition.” It should be understood what is meant by saying $“conditioned by name-and-form there is contact.” $Ānanda, [regarding] the formations and conditions for the existence $of the name group, if those formations and conditions were absent, would $there be contact [by way of] <designation>?206$212^taisho579c Division 9$[Ānanda] answered, “There would not.” $[The Buddha said:] $Ānanda, [regarding] the formations and conditions for the existence of $the form group, if those formations and conditions were absent, would $there be contact [by way of] <resistance>? $[Ānanda] answered, “There would not.” $[The Buddha said,] “[Ānanda,] supposing the name group and the form $group were absent, would there be contact or the concept of contact?” $[Ānanda] answered, “There would not.” $[The Buddha said:] $Ānanda, for this reason it should be understood that this is the cause of $contact, the source of contact, the origin of contact, the condition for con￾tact, namely name-and-form. 
Why is that? Because conditioned by name￾and-form there is contact. 
$Ānanda, if one is asked “Is there a condition for name-and-form?” then $one should answer “There is a condition for name-and-form”; and if one $is asked “What is the condition for name-and-form?” then one should $answer “Consciousness is the condition.” It should be understood what $is meant by saying “conditioned by consciousness there is name-and￾form.” $Ānanda, if consciousness did not enter the mother’s womb, would $name-and-form manifest as this body? $[Ānanda] answered, “It would not.” $[The Buddha said,] “Ānanda, if after entering the mother’s womb con￾sciousness were to depart, would name-and-form combine with the semen?” $[Ānanda] answered, “It would not.” $[The Buddha said:] $Ānanda, if the consciousness of a young boy or girl were to be cut off at $the beginning, destroyed and made nonexistent, would name-and-form $come to growth? $[Ānanda] answered, “It would not.” $[The Buddha said:] $213$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Ānanda, for this reason it should be understood that this is the cause of $name-and-form, the source of name-and-form, the origin of name-and￾form, the condition for name-and-form, namely consciousness. 
Why is $that? Because conditioned by consciousness there is name-and-form. 
$Ānanda, if one is asked “Is there a condition for consciousness?” then $one should answer “There is a condition for consciousness”; and if one is $asked “What is the condition for consciousness?” then one should answer $“Name-and-form is the condition.” It should be understood what is meant $by saying “conditioned by name-and-form there is consciousness.” $Ānanda, if consciousness did not acquire name-and-form, if conscious￾ness were not established on name-and-form and reliant on it, then would $there, for consciousness, be birth, old age, disease, death, and dukkha? $[Ānanda] answered, “There would not.” $[The Buddha said:] $Ānanda, for this reason it should be understood that this is the cause of $consciousness, the source of consciousness, the origin of consciousness, $the condition for consciousness, namely name-and-form. 
Why is that? $Because conditioned by name-and-form there is consciousness. 
$So, Ānanda, conditioned by name-and-form there is consciousness, $and conditioned by consciousness there is name-and-form. 
From this $comes designation, a statement about designation which is transmitted, $a transmitted statement that can be conceptualized, namely from con￾sciousness together with name-and-form.207$Ānanda, why would a [person hold] the view that a self exists? $Venerable Ānanda said to the World-honored One: $The World-honored One is the source of the Dharma; the World-honored $One is the master of the Dharma; the Dharma comes from the World-hon￾ored One. 
May he explain this! Hearing it now, I will gain a full under￾standing of its meaning. 
$Then the Buddha said, “Ānanda, listen closely and pay proper attention. 
$I shall analyze the meaning for you.” Venerable Ānanda listened to receive $the teaching. 
$214^taisho580a Division 9$The Buddha said:208$Ānanda, there might be a [person who holds] the view that feeling is the $self. 
Or again, there might be a [person who] does not [hold] the view $that feeling is the self, but [holds] the view that the self is able to feel, as $it is the nature of the self to be able to feel. 
Or again, there might be a $[person who holds] neither the view that feeling is the self nor the view $that the self is able to feel, as it is the nature of the self to be able to feel, $but [instead holds] the view that the self is without feeling. 
$Ānanda, if there is a [person who holds] the view that feeling is the $self, then one should ask him: “You have three [types of] feeling: pleasant $feeling, painful feeling, and neutral feeling. 
Of these three [type of] feelings $of yours, which feeling do you view as the self?” $Ānanda, one should further tell him that when he experiences a pleasant $feeling, at that time two feelings have ceased, painful feeling and neutral $feeling, and at that time he experiences only pleasant feeling. 
Pleasant $feeling is of an impermanent nature, of an unsatisfactory nature, of a $nature to cease. 
[Yet] when the pleasant feeling has ceased, he does not $think, “Is this not the cessation of the self?”209$Again, Ānanda, when one experiences a painful feeling, at that time $two feelings have ceased, pleasant feeling and neutral feeling, and at that $time he experiences only painful feeling. 
Painful feeling is of an imper￾manent nature, of an unsatisfactory nature, of a nature to cease. 
[Yet] $when the painful feeling has ceased, he does not think, “Is this not the $cessation of the self?” $Again, Ānanda, when one experiences a neutral feeling, at that time $two feelings have ceased, pleasant feeling and painful feeling, and at that $time he experiences only neutral feeling. 
Neutral feeling is of an imper￾manent nature, of an unsatisfactory nature, of a nature to cease. 
[Yet] $when the neutral feeling has ceased, he does not think, “Is this not the $cessation of the self?” $Ānanda, [since] these are impermanent phenomena in this way, a mere $mixture of pleasure and pain,210 is it proper for him to continue [to hold] $the view that feeling is the self? $[Ānanda] answered, “It is not.” $215$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$[The Buddha said:] $Therefore, Ānanda, [since] these are impermanent phenomena in this way, $a mere mixture of pleasure and pain, he should not continue [to hold] the $view that feeling is the self. 
$Again, Ānanda, if there is a [person] who does not [hold] the view that $feeling is the self but rather [holds] that the self is able to feel, the view $that it is the nature of the self to be able to feel, then one should say to $him, “If you had no feeling and were unable to experience feeling, it would $not be proper [for you] to say of it: ‘This is mine.’” $Ānanda, is it proper for him to continue like this to [hold] the view $that [while] feeling is not the self, yet the self is able to feel, the view that $it is the nature of the self to be able to feel? $[Ānanda] answered, “It is not.” $[The Buddha said:] $Therefore, Ānanda, he should not [hold] the view that [while] feeling is $not the self, [yet] the self is able to feel, the view that it is the nature of $the self to be able to feel. 
$Again, Ānanda, if there is a [person who holds] neither the view that $feeling is the self, nor the view that the self is able to feel, it being the $nature of the self to be able to feel, but rather [holds] the view that the $self is without feeling, then one should tell him, “If you had no feeling $and were totally unable to experience [feeling], the self being dissociated $from feeling, then there would be no [such practice as] purification of $the self.”211$Ānanda, is it proper for him, [while] continuing [to hold] the view that $feeling is not the self, and [while] not [holding] the view that the self is $able to feel, it being the nature of the self to be able to feel, to instead $[hold] the view that the self is without feeling? $[Ānanda] answered, “It is not.” $[The Buddha said:] $Therefore, Ānanda, it is not proper for him, [while] thus continuing [to $hold] the view that feeling is not the self, and [while ] not [holding] the $216^taisho580b Division 9$view that the self is able to feel, it being the nature of the self to be able $to feel, to instead [hold] the view that the self is without feeling. 
This is $what is meant by saying that a [person] holds the view that a self exists. 
$Ānanda, how does a [person] not hold the view that a self exists? $Venerable Ānanda said to the World-honored One: $The World-honored One is the source of the Dharma, the World-honored $One is the master of the Dharma, the Dharma comes from the World-hon￾ored One. 
May he explain this! Hearing it now, I will gain a full under￾standing of its meaning. 
$Then the Buddha said, “Ānanda, listen closely and pay proper attention. 
$I shall analyze the meaning for you.” Venerable Ānanda listened to receive $the teaching. 
$The Buddha said: $Ānanda, there might be a [person who] does not [hold] the view that $feeling is the self, or the view that the self is able to feel, it being the nature $of the self to be able to feel, or the view that the self is without feeling. 
$Not holding such views, he does not cling to [anything] in this world; not $clinging, he is not agitated; not being agitated, he [attains] nirvana, knowing $as it really is: “Birth has been ended for me; the holy life has been estab￾lished; what had to be done has been done; there will not be another expe￾riencing of existence.” $Ānanda, these are reckoned [as mere] designations, statements about $designation that are to be transmitted, transmitted statements that can be $conceptualized, to which one who knows does not cling. 
$Ānanda, if a monk has been rightly liberated in this way, he no longer $[holds] the view that the Tathāgata exists after death, [or] the view that $the Tathāgata does not exist after death, [or] the view that the Tathāgata $exists and does not exist after death, [or] the view that the Tathāgata neither $exists nor does not exist after death. 
This is what is meant by saying that $a [person] does not hold the view that a self exists.212$Ānanda, how does a [person] conceive the concept of a self?213$Venerable Ānanda said to the World-honored One: $217$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$The World-honored One is the source of the Dharma, the World-honored $One is the master of the Dharma, the Dharma comes from the World-hon￾ored One. 
May he explain this! Hearing it now, I will gain a full under￾standing of its meaning. 
$Then the Buddha said, “Ānanda, listen closely and pay proper attention. 
$I shall analyze the meaning for you.” Venerable Ānanda listened to receive $the teaching. 
$The Buddha said: $Ānanda, there might be a [person who] conceives the concept of a limited $material self. 
Or again, there might be a [person who] does not conceive $the concept of a limited material self [but] conceives the concept of a $boundless material self. 
$Or again, there might be a [person who] neither conceives the concept $of a limited material self nor conceives the concept of a boundless material $self, [but] conceives the concept of a limited immaterial self. 
Or again, $there might be a [person who] does not conceive the concept of a limited $material self, nor conceives the concept of a boundless material self, nor $conceives the concept of a limited immaterial self [but] conceives the $concept of a boundless immaterial self. 
$Ānanda, if there is a [person who] conceives the concept of a limited $material self, then he conceives the concept of a limited material self in $the present; and [regarding] the breaking up of the body at death he will $make a declaration and [hold] a view as this: “There is a self that at that $time will appear apart from limited materiality.”214 He imagines like this $and that; his thinking is like this. 
Ānanda, in this way a [person] conceives $the concept of a limited material self; in this way one remains attached $to the view of a limited material self. 
$Again, Ānanda, if a [person] does not conceive the concept of a limited $material self [but] conceives the concept of a boundless material self, then $he conceives the concept of a boundless material self in the present; and $[regarding] the breaking up of the body at death he will make a declaration $and [hold] a view like this: “There is a self that at that time will appear $apart from boundless materiality.” He imagines like this and that; his $thinking is like this. 
Ānanda, in this way a [person] conceives the concept $218^taisho580c Division 9$of a boundless material self; in this way one remains attached to the view $of a boundless material self. 
$Again, Ānanda, if there is a [person who] neither conceives the concept $of a limited material self nor conceives the concept of a boundless material $self, [but] conceives the concept of a limited immaterial self, then he con￾ceives the concept of a limited immaterial self in the present; and [regard￾ing] the breaking up of the body at death he will make a declaration and $[hold] a view like this: “There is a self that at that time will appear apart $from limited immateriality.” He imagines like this and that; his thinking $is like this. 
Ānanda, in this way a [person] conceives the concept of a lim￾ited immaterial self; in this way one remains attached to the view of a $limited immaterial self. 
$Again, Ānanda, if there is a [person who] does not conceive the concept $of a limited material self, does not conceive the concept of a boundless $material self, and does not conceive the concept of a limited immaterial $self [but] conceives the concept of a boundless immaterial self, then he $conceives the concept of a boundless immaterial self in the present; and $[regarding] the breaking up of the body at death he will make a declaration $and [hold] a view like this: “There is a self that at that time will appear $apart from boundless immateriality.” He imagines like this and that; his $thinking is like this. 
Ānanda, in this way a [person] conceives the concept $of a boundless immaterial self; in this way a [person] remains attached $to the view of a boundless immaterial self. 
This is what is meant by saying $that one conceives the concept of a self. 
$Ānanda, how does a [person] not conceive the concept of a self? $Venerable Ānanda said to the World-honored One: $The World-honored One is the source of the Dharma, the World-honored $One is the master of the Dharma, the Dharma comes from the World-hon￾ored One.

$Then the Buddha said, “Ānanda, listen closely and pay proper attention. 
$I shall analyze the meaning for you.” Venerable Ānanda listened to receive $the teaching. 
$219^taisho581a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$The Buddha said: $Ānanda, there could be a [person who] does not conceive the concept of $a limited material self, does not conceive the concept of a boundless mate￾rial self, does not conceive the concept of a limited immaterial self, and $does not conceive the concept of a boundless immaterial self. 
$Ānanda, if a [person] does not conceive the concept of a limited material $self, he does not conceive the concept of a limited material self in the $present; and [regarding] the breaking up of the body at death he will not $make a declaration or [hold] a view like this: “There is a self that at that $time will appear apart from limited materiality.” He does not imagine like $this and that; his thinking is not like this. 
Ānanda, in this way a [person] $does not conceive the concept of a limited material self; in this way one $does not remain attached to the view of a limited material self. 
$Again, Ānanda, if there is a [person who] does not conceive the concept $of a boundless material self, then he does not conceive the concept of a $boundless material self in the present; and [regarding] the breaking up of $the body at death he will not make a declaration or [hold] a view like this: $“There is a self that at that time will appear apart from boundless mate￾riality.” He does not imagine like this and that; his thinking is not like $this. 
Ānanda, in this way a [person] does not conceive the concept of a $boundless material self; in this way one does not remain attached to the $view of a boundless material self. 
$Again, Ānanda, if there is a [person who] does not conceive the concept $of a limited immaterial self, then he does not conceive the concept of a $limited immaterial self in the present; and [regarding] the breaking up of $the body at death he will not make a declaration or [hold] a view like this: $“There is a self that at that time will appear apart from limited immate￾riality.” He does not imagine like this and that; his thinking is not like $this. 
Ānanda, in this way a [person] does not conceive the concept of a $limited immaterial self; in this way one does not remain attached to the $view of a limited immaterial self. 
$Again, Ānanda, if there is a [person] who does not conceive the concept $of a boundless immaterial self, then he does not conceive the concept of $a boundless immaterial self in the present; and [regarding] the breaking $220^taisho581b Division 9$up of the body at death he will not make a declaration or [hold] a view $like this: “There is a self that at that time will appear apart from boundless $immateriality.” He does not imagine like this and that; his thinking is not $like this. 
Ānanda, in this way a [person] does not conceive the concept $of a boundless immaterial self; in this way one does not remain attached $to the view of a boundless immaterial self. 
$Ānanda, this is what is meant by saying that a [person] does not con￾ceive the concept of a self. 
$Ānanda, there are seven stations of consciousness and two spheres. 
$What are the seven stations of consciousness? There are material beings $of various bodies and varied perception, namely human beings and devas $of the desire [realm]. 
This is reckoned as the first station of consciousness. 
$Again, Ānanda, there are material beings of various bodies and uniform $perception, namely Brahmā devas born of the first [absorption], who live $long. 
This is reckoned as the second station of consciousness. 
$Again, Ānanda, there are material beings of uniform bodies and varied $perception, namely the devas of Streaming Radiance (Ābhassara). 
This $is reckoned as the third station of consciousness. 
$Again, Ānanda, there are material beings of uniform bodies and uniform $perception, namely the devas of Refulgent Glory (Subhakiṇṇa). 
This is $reckoned as the fourth station of consciousness. 
$Again, Ānanda, there are immaterial beings that by completely tran￾scending perceptions of form, with the cessation of perceptions of resist￾ance, not attending to perceptions of variety, [aware of] the sphere of $infinite space, dwell having attained the sphere of infinite space, namely $devas of the sphere of infinite space. 
This is reckoned as the fifth station $of consciousness. 
$Again, Ānanda, there are immaterial beings that by completely tran￾scending the sphere of infinite space, [aware] of the sphere of infinite con￾sciousness, dwell having attained the sphere of infinite consciousness, $namely devas of the sphere of infinite consciousness. 
This is reckoned as $the sixth station of consciousness. 
$Again, Ānanda, there are immaterial beings that by completely tran￾scending the sphere of infinite consciousness, [aware] of the sphere of $nothingness, dwell having attained the sphere of nothingness, namely $221$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$devas of the sphere of nothingness. 
This is reckoned as the seventh station $of consciousness. 
$Ānanda, what are the two spheres? There are material beings without $perception and without feeling, namely the impercipient devas. 
This is $reckoned as the first sphere. 
$Again, Ānanda, there are immaterial beings that by completely tran￾scending the sphere of nothingness, [aware] of the sphere of neither-per￾ception-nor-nonperception, dwell having attained the sphere of neither-per￾ception-nor-nonperception, namely devas of the sphere of neither-perception￾nor-nonperception. 
This is reckoned as the second sphere. 
$Ānanda, [regarding] the first station of consciousness, [where] there $are material beings of various bodies and varied perception, namely human $beings and devas of the desire [realm]; if a monk knows that station of $consciousness, knows the arising of that station of consciousness, knows $its cessation, knows its advantages, knows its disadvantages, and knows $the escape from it as it really is, Ānanda, would this monk delight in that $station of consciousness? Would he value it or become attached to dwelling $in that station of consciousness? $[Ānanda] answered, “He would not.” $[The Buddha said:] $Ānanda, [regarding] the second station of consciousness, [where] there $are material beings of various bodies and uniform perception, namely $Brahmā devas born of the first [absorption], who live long; if a monk $knows that station of consciousness, knows the arising of that station of $consciousness, knows its cessation, knows its advantages, knows its dis￾advantages, and knows the escape from it as it really is, Ānanda, would $this monk delight in that station of consciousness? Would he value it or $become attached to dwelling in that station of consciousness? $[Ānanda] answered, “He would not.” $[The Buddha said:] $Ānanda, [regarding] the third station of consciousness, [where] there are $material beings of uniform bodies and varied perception, namely the devas $of Streaming Radiance; if a monk knows that station of consciousness, $222^taisho581c Division 9$knows the arising of that station of consciousness, knows its cessation, $knows its advantages, knows its disadvantages, and knows the escape $from it as it really is, Ānanda, would this monk delight in that station of $consciousness?

Would he value $it or become attached to dwelling in that station of consciousness? $[Ānanda] answered, “He would not.” $[The Buddha said:] $Ānanda, [regarding] the sixth station of consciousness, [where] there are $immaterial beings that by completely transcending the sphere of infinite $space, [aware] of the sphere of infinite consciousness, dwell having attained $223$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$the sphere of infinite consciousness, namely devas of the sphere of infinite $consciousness; if a monk knows that station of consciousness, knows the $arising of that station of consciousness, knows its cessation, knows its advan￾tages, knows its disadvantages, and knows the escape from it as it really is, $Ānanda, would this monk delight in that station of consciousness? Would $he value it or become attached to dwelling in that station of consciousness? $[Ānanda] answered, “He would not.” $[The Buddha said:] $Ānanda, [regarding] the seventh station of consciousness, [where] there $are immaterial beings that, by completely transcending the sphere of infinite $consciousness, [aware] of the sphere of nothingness, dwell having attained $the sphere of nothingness, namely devas of the realm of nothingness; if a $monk knows that station of consciousness, knows the arising of that station $of consciousness, knows its cessation, knows its advantages, knows its $disadvantages, and knows the escape from it as it really is, Ānanda, would $this monk delight in that station of consciousness? Would he value it or $become attached to dwelling in that station of consciousness? $[Ānanda] answered, “He would not.” $[The Buddha said:] $Ānanda, [regarding] the first sphere, [where] there are material beings $without perception and without feeling, namely the impercipient devas; $if a monk knows that sphere, knows the arising of that sphere, knows its $cessation, knows its advantages, knows its disadvantage, and knows the $escape from it as it really is, Ānanda, would this monk delight in that $sphere? Would he value it or become attached to dwelling in that sphere? $[Ānanda] answered, “He would not.” $[The Buddha said:] $Ānanda, [regarding] the second sphere, [where] there are immaterial $beings that, by completely transcending the sphere of nothingness, [aware] $of the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception, dwell having $attained the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception, namely devas $224^taisho582a Division 9$of the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception; if a monk knows $that sphere, knows the arising of that sphere, knows its cessation, knows $its advantages, knows its disadvantages, and knows the escape from it as $it really is, Ānanda, would this monk delight in that sphere, would he $value it or become attached to dwelling in that sphere? $[Ānanda] answered, “He would not.” $[The Buddha said:] $Ānanda, if a monk knows these seven stations of consciousness and two $spheres as they really are, if his mind is not defiled by attachment and he $has attained liberation, then he is reckoned to be an arahant monk called $“liberated by wisdom.” $Ānanda, there are eight liberations. 
What are the eight? [Being] mate￾rial, he sees forms. 
This is reckoned as the first liberation. 
$Again, not perceiving forms internally, he sees forms externally. 
This $is reckoned as the second liberation. 
$Again, he dwells having directly realized and accomplished liberation $through purity. 
This is reckoned as the third liberation. 
$Again, by completely transcending perceptions of form, with the ces￾sation of perceptions of resistance, not attending to perceptions of variety, $[aware] of the sphere of infinite space, he dwells having attained the sphere $of infinite space. 
This is reckoned as the fourth liberation. 
$Again, by completely transcending the sphere of infinite space, [aware] $of the sphere of infinite consciousness, he dwells having attained the $sphere of infinite consciousness. 
This is reckoned as the fifth liberation. 
$Again, by completely transcending the sphere of infinite consciousness, $[aware] of the sphere of nothingness, he dwells having attained the sphere $of nothingness. 
This is reckoned as the sixth liberation. 
$Again, by completely transcending the sphere of nothingness, [aware] $of the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception, he dwells having $attained the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception. 
This is reck￾oned as the seventh liberation. 
$Again, by completely transcending the sphere of neither-perception￾nor-nonperception, he dwells having directly realized and accomplished $225$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$the liberation of the cessation of perception and knowing, and seeing with $wisdom he knows that all taints have been eradicated. 
This is reckoned $as the eighth liberation. 
$Ānanda, if a monk knows these seven stations of consciousness and $two spheres as they really are, if his mind is not defiled by attachment $and he has attained liberation, and if he dwells having directly realized $and accomplished these eight liberations in forward and backward order, $and seeing with wisdom knows that all taints have been eradicated, then $he is reckoned to be an arahant monk and is called “liberated both ways.” $Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, Venerable $Ānanda and the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.

^ck The Discourse on the $Establishments of $Mindfulness215$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying among the Kurus, $at a Kuru town called Kammāsadhamma. 
$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $There is one path for the purification of beings, for going beyond sorrow $and fear, for eradicating suffering and distress, for abandoning weeping $and tears, for attaining the true Dharma, namely the four establishments $of mindfulness. 
$If there were tathāgatas of the past, free from attachment and fully $awakened, they all attained realization of unsurpassable and complete $awakening by abandoning the five hindrances that defile the mind and $weaken wisdom, by dwelling with the mind well settled in the four $establishments of mindfulness, and by developing the seven factors of $awakening.216$If there will be tathāgatas of the future, free from attachment and $fully awakened, they will all attain realization of unsurpassable and $complete awakening by abandoning the five hindrances that defile the $mind and weaken wisdom, by dwelling with the mind well settled in $the four establishments of mindfulness, and by developing the seven $factors of awakening. 
$226^taisho582b Division 9$I now, being the tathāgata of the present, free from attachment and fully $awakened, have attained realization of unsurpassable and complete awakening $by abandoning the five hindrances that defile the mind and weaken wisdom, $by dwelling with the mind well settled in the four establishments of mind￾fulness, and by developing the seven factors of awakening. 
$What are the four [establishments of mindfulness]? [They are] the estab￾lishment of mindfulness by contemplating the body as body; and similarly $the establishment of mindfulness by contemplating feelings, ...
[states $of] mind, ...
and dharmas as dharmas.217$What is the establishment of mindfulness by contemplating the body $as body?218 When walking, a monk knows he is walking; when standing, $he knows he is standing; when sitting, he knows he is sitting; when lying $down, he knows he is lying down; when falling asleep, he knows he is $falling asleep; when waking up, he knows he is waking up; when falling $asleep or waking up, he knows he is falling asleep or waking up.219$In this way a monk contemplates the body as body internally [or] he $contemplates the body as body externally.220 He sets up mindfulness in $the body and is endowed with knowledge, vision, understanding, and pen￾etration. 
This is [how] a monk contemplates the body as body. 
$Again, a monk contemplates the body as body. 
When going out and $coming in, a monk clearly knows, contemplates, and discerns [this action] $well; [when] bending or stretching [his limbs], when lowering or raising $[his head], he does so with appropriate deportment; when wearing his $outer robe and other robes and [carrying his] bowl, he does so properly; $when walking, standing, sitting, lying down, [falling] asleep, waking up, $speaking, and keeping silent—all [these activities] he clearly knows.221$In this way a monk contemplates the body as body internally [or] he $contemplates the body as body externally. 
He sets up mindfulness in the $body and is endowed with knowledge, vision, understanding, and pene￾tration. 
This is [how] a monk contemplates the body as body. 
$Again, a monk contemplates the body as body. 
[When] evil and $unwholesome thoughts arise, a monk controls, abandons, eradicates, and $stops them by recollecting wholesome dharmas.222$It is just as a carpenter or a carpenter’s apprentice might apply an inked $string to a piece of wood [to mark a straight line] and then cut the wood $227^taisho582c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$with a sharp adze to make it straight.223 In the same way, [when] evil $unwholesome thoughts arise, a monk controls, abandons, eradicates, and $stops them by recollecting wholesome dharmas. 
$In this way a monk contemplates the body as body internally [or] he $contemplates the body as body externally. 
He sets up mindfulness in the $body and is endowed with knowledge, vision, understanding, and pene￾tration. 
This is [how] a monk contemplates the body as body. 
$Again, a monk contemplates the body as body. 
With teeth clenched $and tongue pressed against his palate, a monk uses [the will-power of his $own] mind to control his mind, to control, abandon, eradicate, and stop $[evil thoughts]. 
$It is just as two strong men might seize a weaker man and shoving him $this way and that, they beat him up as they wish. 
In the same way, with $teeth clenched and tongue pressed against his palate, a monk uses [the $will-power of his own] mind to control his mind, to control, abandon, $eradicate, and stop [evil thoughts]. 
$In this way a monk contemplates the body as body internally [or] he $contemplates the body as body externally. 
He sets up mindfulness in the $body and is endowed with knowledge, vision, understanding, and pene￾tration. 
This is [how] a monk contemplates the body as body. 
$Again, a monk contemplates the body as body: A monk is mindful of $breathing in and knows he is breathing in mindfully; he is mindful of $breathing out and knows he is breathing out mindfully. 
[When] breathing $in long, he knows he is breathing in long; [when] breathing out long, he $knows he is breathing out long. 
[When] breathing in short, he knows he $is breathing in short; [when] breathing out short, he knows he is breathing $out short. 
$He trains [in experiencing] the whole body when breathing in; he trains $[in experiencing] the whole body when breathing out. 
He trains in calming $bodily activities when breathing in; he trains in calming <bodily> activities $when breathing out.224$In this way a monk contemplates the body as body internally [or] he $contemplates the body as body externally. 
He sets up mindfulness in the $body and is endowed with knowledge, vision, understanding, and pene￾tration. 
This is [how] a monk contemplates the body as body. 
$228$Division 9$Again, a monk contemplates the body as body. 
A monk completely $drenches and pervades his body from within with rapture and pleasure born $of seclusion [experienced in the first absorption], so that there is no part [of $his body] that is not pervaded by rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.225$It is just as a bath attendant, having filled a vessel with bathing powder, $might mix it with water and knead it so that no part of [the powder] is not $completely drenched and pervaded with water. 
In the same way, a monk $completely drenches and pervades his body from within with rapture and $pleasure born of seclusion, so that there is no part [of his body] that is not $pervaded by rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. 
$In this way a monk contemplates the body as body internally [or] he $contemplates the body as body externally. 
He sets up mindfulness in the $body and is endowed with knowledge, vision, understanding, and pene￾tration. 
This is [how] a monk contemplates the body as body. 
$Again, a monk contemplates the body as body. 
A monk completely $drenches and pervades his body from within with rapture and pleasure $born of concentration [experienced in the second absorption], so that there $is no part [of his body] that is not pervaded by rapture and pleasure born $of concentration. 
$It is just like a mountain spring that is full and overflowing with clear, $clean water so that water coming from any of the four directions cannot $enter it, with springwater welling up from the bottom on its own, flowing $out and flooding the surroundings, completely drenching and pervading $every part of the mountain. 
In the same way, a monk completely drenches $and pervades his body from within with rapture and pleasure born of con￾centration so that there is no part [of his body] that is not pervaded by $rapture and pleasure born of concentration. 
$In this way a monk contemplates the body as body internally [or] he $contemplates the body as body externally. 
He sets up mindfulness in the $body and is endowed with knowledge, vision, understanding, and pene￾tration. 
This is [how] a monk contemplates the body as body. 
$Again, a monk contemplates the body as body. 
A monk completely $drenches and pervades his body from within with pleasure born of the $absence of rapture [experienced in the third absorption], so that there is $229^taisho583a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$no part [of his body] that is not pervaded by pleasure born of the absence $of rapture. 
$It is just as a blue, red, or white lotus that is born in the water and has $come to full growth in the water, remains submerged in the water with $every part of its roots, stem, flower, and leaves completely drenched and $pervaded [by it], with no part that is not pervaded by [the water]. 
In the $same way, a monk completely drenches and pervades his body from within $with pleasure born of the absence of rapture so that there is no part [of $his body] that is not pervaded by pleasure born of the absence of rapture. 
$In this way a monk contemplates the body as body internally [or] he $contemplates the body as body externally. 
He sets up mindfulness in the $body and is endowed with knowledge, vision, understanding, and pene￾tration. 
This is [how] a monk contemplates the body as body. 
$Again, a monk contemplates the body as body. 
A monk mentally $resolves to dwell having accomplished a complete pervasion of his body $from within with mental purity [experienced in the fourth absorption], so $that there is no part [of his body] that is not pervaded by mental purity. 
$It is just as a person might cover himself from head to foot with a cloth $measuring seven or eight units, so that every part of his body is covered. 
$In the same way, a monk completely pervades his body from within with $mental purity [experienced in the fourth absorption], so that there is no $part [of his body] that is not pervaded by mental purity. 
$In this way a monk contemplates the body as body internally [or] he $contemplates the body as body externally. 
He sets up mindfulness in the $body and is endowed with knowledge, vision, understanding, and pene￾tration. 
This is [how] a monk contemplates the body as body. 
$Again, a monk contemplates the body as body. 
A monk is mindful of $the perception of light (ālokasaññā), properly taking hold of it, properly $retaining it, and recollecting it properly with mindfulness, [so that] what $is behind is like what is in front, what is in front is like what is behind, $night is like day, day is like night, what is above is like what is below, $and what is below is like what is above. 
In this way, he develops an undis￾torted and undefiled state of mind that is bright and clear, a state of mind $that is totally unobscured by impediments.226$230$Division 9$In this way a monk contemplates the body as body internally [or] he $contemplates the body as body externally. 
He sets up mindfulness of the $body and is endowed with knowledge, vision, understanding, and pene￾tration. 
This is [how] a monk contemplates the body as body. 
$Again, a monk contemplates the body as body. 
A monk properly grasps $the reviewing sign,227 recollecting it properly with mindfulness. 
It is just $as someone who is seated might contemplate another person who is lying $down, or while lying down might contemplate someone who is seated. 
$In the same way, a monk properly grasps the reviewing sign, recollecting $it properly with mindfulness. 
$In this way a monk contemplates the body as body internally [or] he $contemplates the body as body externally. 
He establishes mindfulness in $the body and is endowed with knowledge, vision, understanding, and pen￾etration. 
This is [how] a monk contemplates the body as body. 
$Again, a monk contemplates the body as body. 
A monk contemplates $this body from head to foot, according to its position and according to its $attractive and repulsive [qualities], as full of various kinds of impurities, $[reflecting]: “Within this body of mine there is head hair, body hair, nails, $teeth, rough and smooth epidermis, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, heart, kid￾neys, liver, lungs, large intestine, small intestine, spleen, stomach, feces, $brain and brain stem, tears, sweat, mucus, saliva, pus, blood, fat, marrow, $phlegm, bile, and urine.” $It is just as a person endowed with eyesight, on seeing a vessel full of $various seeds, might clearly distinguish them all, identifying them as rice $seeds, millet seeds, turnip seeds, or mustard seeds.228 In the same way, a $monk contemplates this body from head to foot, according to its position $and according to its attractive and repulsive [qualities], as full of various $kinds of impurities, [reflecting]: “Within this body of mine there is head $hair, body hair, nails, teeth, rough and smooth epidermis, skin, flesh, $sinews, bones, heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, large intestine, small intestine, $spleen, stomach, feces, brain and brain stem, tears, sweat, mucus, saliva, $pus, blood, fat, marrow, phlegm, bile, and urine.” $In this way a monk contemplates the body as body internally [or] he $contemplates the body as body externally.

This is [how] a monk contemplates the body as body. 
$Again, a monk contemplates the body as body. 
A monk contemplates $the body [as made up of] elements: “Within this body of mine there is the $earth element, the water element, the fire element, the wind element, the $space element, and the consciousness element.”229$It is just as a butcher, having slaughtered and skinned a cow, might $divide it into six parts and spread them on the ground [to display them $for sale]. 
In the same way a monk contemplates the body [as made up of] $elements: “Within this body of mine there is the earth element, the water $element, the fire element, the wind element, the space element, and the $consciousness element.” $In this way a monk contemplates the body as body internally [or] he $contemplates the body as body externally. 
He sets up mindfulness of the $body and is endowed with knowledge, vision, understanding, and pene￾tration. 
This is [how] a monk contemplates the body as body. 
$Again, a monk contemplates the body as body. 
A monk contemplates $a corpse that has been dead for one, two, or up to six or seven days, which $is being pecked at by crows, devoured by jackals and wolves, burned by $fire, or buried in the earth,230 or that is completely rotten and decomposed. 
$Seeing this, he compares himself to it: “This present body of mine is also $like this. 
It is of the same nature and in the end cannot escape [this fate].” $In this way a monk contemplates the body as body internally [or] he $contemplates the body as body externally. 
He sets up mindfulness of the $body and is endowed with knowledge, vision, understanding, and pene￾tration. 
This is [how] a monk contemplates the body as body. 
$Again, a monk contemplates the body as body. 
Just as he has formerly $seen [a corpse] in a charnel ground, [so] the monk [recollects] a carcass $of bluish color, decomposed and half eaten [by animals], the bones lying $on the ground still connected together. 
Seeing this, he compares himself $to it: “This present body of mine is also like this.

Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks $were delighted and received it respectfully. 
$99. 
^ck The [First] Discourse $on the Mass of Dukkha238$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$237^taisho584c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$At that time, after the midday meal, the monks were seated together in $the assembly hall for some small matter, when many heterodox practitioners, $who were roaming around after midday, approached the monks.239 Having $exchanged greetings, stepped back, and sat to one side, they said to the $monks: $Venerable friends, the renunciant Gotama sets forth penetrative knowledge $of sensual pleasures, he sets forth penetrative knowledge of material form, $and he sets forth penetrative knowledge of feelings. 
Venerable friends, $we too set forth penetrative knowledge of sensual pleasures, set forth pen￾etrative knowledge of material form, and set forth penetrative knowledge $of feelings. 
$In regard to these two knowledges and these two penetrations [set forth $by] the renunciant Gotama and by ourselves, which is superior [or inferior] $and what is different? $Then the monks, hearing what the many heterodox practitioners had said, $neither agreed nor disagreed but silently got up and left, thinking: “From the $World-honored One we shall obtain an understanding of what has thus been $said.” Then they approached the Buddha. 
Having paid homage with their $heads [at his feet], stepped back, and sat to one side, they told the Buddha $the whole discussion they had had with the many heterodox practitioners. 
$Then the World-honored One told the monks: $You should have right away asked the many heterodox practitioners this: $“Venerable friends, what is the gratification (assāda) in sensual pleasures, $what is the danger (ādīnava) in sensual pleasures, and what is the escape $(nissaraṇa) from sensual pleasures? What is the gratification in material $form, what is the danger in material form, and what is the escape from $material form? What is the gratification in feelings, what is the danger in $feelings, and what is the escape from feelings?” $Monks, if you had asked them this, then on hearing [these questions] $they would have found it hard to respond. 
They would have [diverted the] $talk to some other topic, would have become more and more upset, and $[in the end] would certainly have risen up from their seats and withdrawn $in silence. 
Why is that? $238$Division 9$I do not see in this world, with its devas and māras, Brahmās, renun￾ciants, and brahmins, and all other assemblies, anyone who is able to $understand and expound the significance of this, excepting the Tathāgata, $a disciple of the Tathāgata, or someone who has heard it from them. 
$The Buddha said: $What is the gratification in sensual pleasures? It is the pleasure and joy $that arises in dependence on the five cords of sensual pleasure. 
This is the $foremost gratification in sensual pleasures with nothing beyond it, [yet] $it is beset by much danger. 
$What is the danger in sensual pleasures? A clansman uses whatever $ability or skill he has to gain his livelihood, whether it is farming, trading, $using scholarly knowledge, skill in accountancy, knowledge of calculation, $skill in carving seals, composing documents, making pens, understanding $sacred texts, serving as a brave general, or attending the king. 
$When it is cold, he is [afflicted by] cold; when it is hot, he is [afflicted $by] heat; he becomes hungry, thirsty, and tired, and is stung by mosquitoes $and gadflies as he undertakes such work in his quest for wealth. 
$If that clansman, making such efforts, engaged in such activity and $such striving, does not obtain wealth, then he experiences sorrow and $pain, he worries and grieves, is upset and vexed, and bewilderment arises $in his mind. 
He says [to himself], “My undertakings are in vain, my suf￾fering is in vain, my striving is unsuccessful!” $If, [however,] that clansman, making such efforts, engaged in such $activity and such striving, does obtain wealth, then he cherishes and values $it, guarding it in a concealed storeroom. 
Why is that? $[Because he thinks,] “May this wealth of mine not be taken away $forcibly by kings, stolen by thieves, or burned up in fire; may it not rot $and decay or become lost! May none of my money go out without making $profit, or be employed for any undertaking that fails!” [For these reasons,] $he guards [his wealth] thus, in a concealed storeroom. 
$If it is taken away forcibly by kings, stolen by thieves, burned in a fire, $spoiled, destroyed, ruined, or lost, then sorrow and pain arise. 
He worries $and grieves, is upset and vexed, and bewilderment arises in his mind, as $239^taisho585a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$he says [to himself,] “That which I cherished for a long time is now ruined $and lost.” This is what is meant by a mass of dukkha in the present, which $has sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its condition, and $sensual pleasures as its source.240$Again, [among] living beings, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual $pleasures as the condition, and sensual pleasures as the source, a mother $quarrels with her child, or a child quarrels with its mother, a father [quarrels $with] his child, ...
an elder brother with his younger brother, ...
an elder $sister with her younger sister, ...
or relatives quarrel with one another. 
$Having quarreled like this, a mother speaks badly of her child, a child $speaks badly of its mother, a father [speaks badly] of his child ...
an elder $brother of his younger brother, ...
an elder sister of her younger sister, ...
$and relatives speak badly of one another, let alone other people.241 This $is what is meant by a mass of dukkha in the present, which has sensual $pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its condition, and sensual pleas￾ures as its source. 
$Again, [among] living beings, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sen￾sual pleasures as the condition, and sensual pleasures as the source, kings $quarrel with kings, brahmins quarrel with brahmins, householders quarrel $with householders, citizens quarrel with citizens, and countries quarrel $with countries. 
$Because they quarrel with and hate one another they take up various $kinds of weapons to harm each other, striking [each other] with their fists, $or hurling stones [at each other], or hitting [each other] with sticks, or $cutting [each other] with swords. 
During the quarrel they may die or become $terrified, experiencing extreme suffering. 
This is what is meant by a mass $of dukkha in the present, which has sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual $pleasures as its condition, and sensual pleasures as its source. 
$Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleasures as the $condition, sensual pleasures as the source, living beings put on armor and $coats [of mail], take up lances or bows and arrows, or wield swords and $shields and go into battle. 
They fight on elephants, horses, or chariots, or $as foot soldiers, or they fight as [ordinary] people.242 During the battle $they may die or become terrified, experiencing extreme suffering. 
This $is what is meant by a mass of dukkha in the present, which has sensual $240^taisho585b Division 9$pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its condition, and sensual pleas￾ures as its source. 
$Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleasures as the $condition, and sensual pleasures as the source, living beings put on armor $and coats [of mail], take up lances or bows and arrows, or wield swords $and shields, and [set out to] conquer another country. 
They besiege a city $and destroy its fortifications, lining up in battle array to the beating of $drums, the blowing of horns, and loud shouting. 
They strike with hammers, $or they use spears and halberds, or they use cutting wheels, or they shoot $arrows, or they hurl down rocks, or they use great catapults, or they pour $down molten copper pellets. 
During the battle they may die or become $terrified, experiencing extreme suffering. 
This is what is meant by a mass $of dukkha in the present, which has sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual $pleasures as its condition, and sensual pleasures as its source. 
$Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleasures as the $condition, and sensual pleasures as the source, living beings put on armor $or coats [of mail], take up lances or bows and arrows, or wield swords $and shields, and advance into a village, a town, a country, or a city. 
They $break through walls and open up storerooms to steal property. 
They inter￾cept [travelers] on the king’s highway or reach out to other streets. 
They $destroy villages, damage towns, wipe out countries, and break up cities. 
$In the process they may be caught by the king’s men, who subject them $to various punishments, such as cutting off their hands, their feet, or both $hands and feet; cutting off their ears, their nose, or both ears and nose; or $slicing strips [of flesh] off them, or tearing out their beards, their hair, or both $beards and hair; or putting them in a cage and setting fire to their clothing, $or wrapping them in straw and setting fire to it, or placing them in the belly $of an “iron donkey” or in the mouth of an “iron pig” or in the mouth of an $“iron tiger” and then heating it up; or placing them in a copper or iron cauldron $and boiling them; or cutting them into pieces, or stabbing them with sharp $forks, or hooking them with iron hooks, or laying them down on an iron bed $and scalding them with boiling oil, or seating them in an iron mortar and $pounding them with an iron pestle, or letting them be bitten by snakes or $serpents, or whipping them with whips, or beating them with staves, or hitting $them with clubs, or impaling them alive on a tall post, or decapitating them. 
$241$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$In the process they will die or become terrified, experiencing extreme $suffering. 
This is what is meant by a mass of dukkha in the present, which $has sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its condition, and $sensual pleasures as its source. 
$Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleasures as the $condition, and sensual pleasures as the source, living beings do evil bodily $verbal, and mental deeds. 
At a later time they are afflicted by disease and $lie on their beds, or sit or lie on the ground, with pain oppressing their $body, experiencing extremely severe pain that is not at all desirable. 
$At the time of death their evil bodily, verbal, and mental deeds manifest $before them and envelop them. 
It is just as when at sunset, the shadow of $a great mountain peak envelops the earth—in the same way their evil bodily, $verbal, and mental deeds manifest before them and envelop them.243$They think: “Formerly I did evil deeds, which are [now] manifesting $before me and enveloping me. 
Formerly I did not perform meritorious $acts; I performed many evil acts. 
If there is a place where people are reborn $who do what is evil, bad, and harmful, who only commit crimes, who $make no merit and do no good deeds, who are without fear [of the con￾sequences of their deeds], without reliance, without a refuge, then I will $certainly be reborn there.” $From this they feel regret, and being regretful they have a bad death, $and their life ends without merit. 
This is what is meant by a mass of dukkha in the present, which has sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures $as its condition, and sensual pleasures as its source. 
$Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleasures as the $condition, and sensual pleasures as the source, living beings do evil bodily, $verbal, and mental deeds. 
Because of those evil bodily, verbal, and mental $deeds, with this as the cause, with this as the condition, on the breaking $up of the body at death they will certainly go to a bad realm and be reborn $in hell. 
This is what is meant by a mass of dukkha in the next life that has $sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its condition, and $sensual pleasures as its source. 
This is what is meant by the danger of $sensual pleasures. 
$What is the escape from sensual pleasures? The abandoning and dis￾carding of sensual pleasures, the relinquishing and renunciation of sensual $242^taisho585c Division 9$pleasures, the cessation of sensual pleasures, the eradication of sensual $pleasures, the transcending of and escaping from sensual pleasures—this $is what is meant by the escape from sensual pleasures. 
$Any renunciants or brahmins who do not know, as it really is, the grat￾ification in sensual pleasures, the danger in sensual pleasures, and the escape $from sensual pleasures are totally unable to abandon sensual pleasures them￾selves. 
How then could they cause others to abandon sensual pleasures? $Any renunciants or brahmins who know, as it really is, the gratification $in sensual pleasures, the danger in sensual pleasures, and the escape from $sensual pleasures are able to discard [sensual pleasures] themselves and $also able to cause others to abandon sensual pleasures. 
$What is the gratification in material form? Suppose there is a girl from $the warrior, brahmin, merchant, or worker [caste], fourteen or fifteen years $old. 
At that time her physical beauty is at its most excellent. 
The pleasure $and joy that arise with her physical beauty as its cause, with her physical $beauty as its condition, that is the foremost gratification in material form. 
$Nothing excels it, [yet] it is beset by much danger. 
$What is the danger in material form? Suppose one were to see that $beautiful girl at a later time when she has become extremely old and $feeble, her hair turned white and teeth fallen out, with hunched back and $unsteady on her feet, leaning on a stick to walk, with deteriorating health, $her life span approaching its end, her body trembling, and her sense fac￾ulties failing. 
$What do you think? Has her former physical beauty ceased and its dan￾ger manifested? $[The monks] replied, “Yes indeed.” $[The Buddha said:] $Again, suppose one were to see that [formerly] beautiful girl afflicted $with disease, lying on a bed, or sitting or lying on the ground, with pain $oppressing her body, experiencing extremely severe pain. 
What do you $think?

What do you $think? Has her former physical beauty ceased and its danger manifested? $[The monks] replied, “Yes indeed.” $[The Buddha said:] $Again, suppose one were to see [the corpse of] that [formerly] beautiful $girl in a charnel ground as a carcass of bluish color, decomposed and half $eaten [by animals], with the skeleton lying on the ground still connected $together. 
What do you think? Has her former physical beauty ceased and $its danger manifested? $[The monks] replied, “Yes indeed.” $[The Buddha said:] $Again, suppose one were to see [the skeleton of] that beautiful girl in a $charnel ground without skin, flesh, or blood, held together only by sinews. 
$What do you think: has her former physical beauty ceased and its danger $manifested? $[The monks] replied, “Yes indeed.” $[The Buddha said:] $Again, suppose one were to see [the bones of] that [formerly] beautiful $girl in a charnel ground, disconnected bones scattered in all directions: $feet bones, shin bones, thigh bones, hip bone, vertebrae, shoulder bones, $neck bones, and a skull, all in different places. 
What do you think: has $her former physical beauty ceased and its danger manifested? $[The monks] replied, “Yes indeed.” $[The Buddha said:] $Again, suppose one were to see [the bones of] that [formerly] beautiful $girl in a charnel ground, bones white like shells, or bluish like the color $of pigeons, or red as if smeared with blood, rotting and decomposing, in $244^taisho586a Division 9$bits and pieces.

At that time he has neither $harmful intentions toward himself nor harmful intentions toward others.

$Thus spoke the Buddha.

$100. 
^ck The [Second] Discourse $on the Mass of Dukkha244$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying among the Sakyans $at Kapilavatthu, in Nigrodha Park. 
$At that time Mahānāma the Sakyan, while walking about after midday, $approached the Buddha. 
Having paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s $feet, stepped back, and sat to one side, he said: $World-honored One, as I understand the teaching of the World-honored $One, I must bring about the cessation of the three defilements in my mind: $the defilement of mind by greed, the defilement of mind by hatred, and $the defilement of mind by delusion. 
$World-honored One, [although] I understand the teaching like this, yet $states of greed, states of hatred, and states of delusion still arise in my $mind. 
World-honored One, I am thinking: What condition have I not erad￾icated that still causes states of greed, states of hatred, and states of delusion $to arise in my mind? $The World-honored One said: $Mahānāma, [within] you there is one condition that has not been eradicated, $namely [that because of which] you remain a householder, instead of leav￾ing the household life out of faith and becoming a homeless one to practice $the path. 
Mahānāma, if you had eradicated this one condition, you would $246^taisho586b Division 9$certainly not remain a householder but would certainly leave the household $life out of faith and become a homeless one to practice the path. 
It is $because this one condition has not been eradicated that you have remained $a householder instead of leaving the household life out of faith and becom￾ing a homeless one to practice the path. 
$At this Mahānāma the Sakyan rose from his seat, arranged his robe so as $to bare one shoulder, extended his hands with palms joined toward the Buddha, $and said to the World-honored One, “May the World-honored One teach me $the Dharma, so that my mind may become purified, free itself of doubt, and $attain the path!”245$The World-honored One said:246$Mahānāma, there are the five strands of sensual pleasure that are desirable, $thought about, delighted in, connected with desire, and enjoyed by people. 
$What are the five? They are visible forms known by the eye, sounds known $by the ear, odors known by the nose, flavors known by the tongue, and $tangibles known by the body. 
$From these, kings and the retinue of kings gain pleasure and delight. 
$Mahānāma, this is the foremost gratification in sensual pleasures. 
Nothing $excels it, [yet] it is beset by much danger. 
$Mahānāma, what is the danger in sensual pleasures? Mahānāma, a $clansman may use whatever ability or skill he has to gain his livelihood, $whether it is farming, trading, using scholarly knowledge, skill in account￾ancy, knowledge of calculation, skill in carving seals, composing docu￾ments, making pens, understanding sacred texts, serving as a brave general, $or attending the king. 
$When it is cold, he is [afflicted by] cold; when it is hot, he is [afflicted $by] heat; he becomes hungry, thirsty, and tired, and is stung by mosquitoes $and gadflies as he undertakes such work in his quest for wealth. 
Mahānāma, $if that clansmen, making such efforts, engaged in such activity and such $striving, does not obtain wealth, then he experiences sorrow and unhap￾piness, he worries and grieves, is upset and vexed, and bewilderment $arises in his mind. 
He says [to himself], “My undertakings are in vain, $my suffering is in vain, my striving is unsuccessful!” $247^taisho586c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$[However,] Mahānāma, if that clansman, making such effort, engaged $in such activity and such striving, does obtain wealth, then he cherishes $and values it, guarding it in a concealed storeroom. 
Why is that? $[Because he thinks,] “May this wealth of mine not be taken away $forcibly by kings, stolen by thieves, or burned in a fire; may it not rot or $decay or become lost! May none of my money go out without [making $a] profit, or be employed for any undertaking that fails!” [For these reasons] $he guards [his wealth] thus in a concealed storeroom. 
$If [his wealth] is taken away forcibly by kings, stolen by thieves, or $burned in a fire; if it rots or decays or becomes lost, then sorrow and $unhappiness arise. 
He worries and grieves, is upset and vexed, and bewil￾derment arises in his mind, and he says [to himself], “That which I long $cherished is lost!” Like this, Mahānāma, is the mass of dukkha in the pres￾ent, which has sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its con￾dition, and sensual pleasures as its source.247$Again, Mahānāma, [among] living beings, with sensual pleasures as $the cause, sensual pleasures as the condition, and sensual pleasures as the $source, a mother quarrels with her child, or a child quarrels with its mother, $a father [quarrels with] his child ...
an elder brother with his younger $brother, ...

or relatives speak badly of one another, let alone other people.248 $This, Mahānāma, is what is meant by a mass of dukkha in the present, $which has sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its condition, $and sensual pleasures as its source. 
$Again, Mahānāma, [among] living beings, with sensual pleasures as $the cause, sensual pleasures as the condition, and sensual pleasures as the $source, kings quarrel with kings, brahmins quarrel with brahmins, house￾holders quarrel with householders, citizens quarrel with citizens, countries $quarrel with countries. 
$Because they quarrel and hate each other, they take up various kinds $of weapons to harm each other, striking [each other] with their fists, or $248$Division 9$hurling stones [at each other], or hitting [each other] with sticks, or cutting $[each other] with swords. 
During the quarrel they may die or become ter￾rified, experiencing extreme suffering. 
This, Mahānāma, is what is meant $by a mass of dukkha in the present, which has sensual pleasures as its cause, $sensual pleasures as its condition, and sensual pleasures as its source. 
$Again, Mahānāma, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleas￾ures as the condition, and sensual pleasures as the source, living beings $put on armor and coats [of mail], take up lances or bows and arrows, or $wield swords and shields, and go into battle. 
They fight on elephants, $horses, or chariots, or as foot soldiers, or they fight as [ordinary] people.249$During the battle they may die or become terrified, experiencing extreme $suffering. 
This, Mahānāma, is what is meant by a mass of dukkha in the $present, which has sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its $condition, and sensual pleasures as its source. 
$Again, Mahānāma, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleas￾ures as the condition, and sensual pleasures as the source, living beings $put on armor and coats [of mail], take up lances or bows and arrows, or $wield swords and shields, and [set out to] conquer another country. 
They $besiege a city and destroy its fortifications, lining up in battle array to the $beating of drums, the blowing of horns, and loud shouting. 
They strike $with hammers, or they use spears and halberds, or they use cutting wheels, $or they shoot arrows, or they hurl down rocks, or they use great catapults, $or they pour down molten copper pellets. 
During the battle they may die $or become terrified, experiencing extreme suffering. 
This, Mahānāma, is $what is meant by a mass of dukkha in the present, which has sensual pleas￾ures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its condition, and sensual pleasures $as its source.

They break through walls and open up storerooms to steal prop￾erty. 
They interrupt the king’s highway or reach out to other streets. 
They $destroy villages, damage towns, wipe out countries, and break up cities. 
$249^taisho587a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$In the process they may be caught by the king’s men, who subject them $to various punishments, such as cutting off their hands, feet, or both hands $and feet; cutting off their ears, nose, or both ears and nose; or slicing strips $[of flesh] off them, or tearing out their beards or hair, or tearing out both $beards and hair, or putting them in a cage and setting fire to their clothing, $or wrapping them in straw and setting fire to it; or placing them in the $belly of an “iron donkey” or in the mouth of an “iron pig” or in the mouth $of an “iron tiger” and then heating it up, or putting them into a copper or $iron cauldron and boiling them; or cutting them into pieces, or stabbing $them with sharp forks, or hooking them with iron hooks, or laying them $down on an iron bed and scalding them with boiling oil, or seating them $in an iron mortar and pounding them with an iron pestle, or letting them $be bitten by snakes or serpents, or whipping them with whips, beating $them with sticks, or hitting them with clubs, or impaling them alive on a $tall post, or decapitating them. 
$In the process they will die or become terrified, experiencing extreme $suffering. 
This, Mahānāma, is what is meant by a mass of dukkha in the $present, which has sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its $condition, and sensual pleasures as its source. 
$Again, Mahānāma, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleas￾ures as the condition, and sensual pleasures as the source, living beings $do evil bodily, verbal, and mental deeds. 
At a later time they are afflicted $by disease and lie on a bed, or sit or lie on the ground, with pain oppressing $their body, experiencing extremely severe pain that is not at all desirable. 
$At the time of death their evil bodily, verbal, and mental deeds manifest $before them and envelop them. 
Just as when at sunset, the shadow of a $great mountain peak envelops the earth, in the same way their evil bodily, $verbal, and mental deeds manifest before them and envelop them.250$They think: “Formerly I did evil deeds, which are [now] manifesting $before me and enveloping me. 
Formerly I did not perform meritorious $acts; I performed many evil acts. 
If there is a place where people are reborn $who do what is evil, bad, and harmful, who only commit crimes, who $make no merit and do no good deeds, who are without fear [of the con￾sequences], without reliance, without a refuge—then I will certainly be $reborn there.” $250$Division 9$From this they feel regret, and being regretful they have an unwholesome $death and their life ends without merit. 
This, Mahānāma, is what is meant $by a mass of dukkha in the present, which has sensual pleasures as its cause, $sensual pleasures as its condition, and sensual pleasures as its source. 
$Again, Mahānāma, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleas￾ures as the condition, and sensual pleasures as the source, living beings $do evil bodily, verbal, and mental deeds. 
Because of those evil bodily, $verbal, and mental deeds, with this as the cause, with this as the condition, $on the breaking up of the body at death they will certainly go to a bad $realm and are reborn in hell. 
This, Mahānāma, is what is meant by a mass $of dukkha in the next life that has sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual $pleasures as its condition, and sensual pleasures as its source. 
$Mahānāma, for this reason it should be understood that there is no hap￾piness at all in sensual pleasures; [there is only] immeasurable suffering $and misery. 
[If] a learned noble disciple does not see this as it really is, $then he is enveloped by sensual pleasures and will not attain the happiness $of relinquishment and unsurpassable peace. 
$Mahānāma, in this way a learned noble disciple regresses because of sen￾sual pleasures. 
Mahānāma, I know that there is no happiness in sensual pleas￾ures, but only immeasurable misery. 
Knowing this as it really is, Mahānāma, $I am not enveloped by sensual pleasures and not overcome by what is evil, $and so I attain the happiness of relinquishment and unsurpassable peace. 
$Mahānāma, for this reason I do not regress because of sensual pleasures.251$Mahānāma, once I was dwelling near Rājagaha, on Mount Vebhāra in $the Sattapaṇṇi Cave [frequented by] seers.252 Mahānāma, in the late afternoon, $having risen from sitting in meditation, I approached the mountainside. 
$There I saw many Nigaṇṭhas engaged in the practice of not sitting $down, standing continuously without sitting down, experiencing extremely $severe pain. 
I approached them and asked, “Nigaṇṭhas, for what reason $do you engage in this practice of not sitting down, standing continuously $without sitting down, experiencing pain like this?” $They said, “Gotama, we have a teacher, a Nigaṇṭha called Nātaputta, $who teaches us, saying,253 ‘Nigaṇṭhas, any unwholesome karma done in $your former lives will certainly be eradicated through these ascetic practices. 
$251^taisho587b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$If you now maintain good bodily verbal, and mental conduct, then because $of that you will perform no further evil and unwholesome karma.’” $Mahānāma, I questioned them further, “Nigaṇṭhas, do you have faith $in your teacher and are you free of doubt?”254 They replied, “Yes indeed, $Gotama. 
We have faith in our teacher and are free of doubt.” $Mahānāma, I questioned them further, “Nigaṇṭhas, if this is the case, $then [does this mean that] in a former life you and your Nigaṇṭha teacher $repeatedly performed evil and unwholesome deeds,255 and having formerly $performed [such deeds] you Nigaṇṭhas, on passing away and being reborn $now in the human realm, went forth as Nigaṇṭhas to engage in the practice $of not sitting down, standing continuously without sitting down, experi￾encing pain like this, just as you and your disciples are doing?” $They replied, “Gotama, happiness is attained not through happiness $but through pain. 
The happiness experienced by the renunciant Gotama $cannot match that of King Bimbisāra.” $I said further, “You are confused. 
What you say lacks meaning. 
Why $is that? Unskilled, lacking in understanding, and not knowing the right $time, you have made this statement:256 ‘The happiness experienced by the $renunciant Gotama cannot match that of King Bimbisāra.’ Nigaṇṭhas, you $should have first asked, ‘Who [experiences] the higher happiness, King $Bimbisāra or the renunciant Gotama?’ Nigaṇṭhas, I would have answered $like this, ‘I [experience] the higher happiness; King Bimbisāra cannot $match it.’ However, Nigaṇṭhas, you stated that ‘The happiness experienced $by the renunciant Gotama cannot match that of King Bimbisāra.’” $Then the Nigaṇṭhas said, “Gotama, we now ask the renunciant $Gotama: Who [experiences] the higher happiness, King Bimbisāra or $the renunciant Gotama?” $I replied further, “Nigaṇṭhas, I shall now ask you a question. 
Answer $according to your understanding. 
Nigaṇṭhas, what do you think? Can King $Bimbisāra, according to his wish, remain in silence, not speaking a word, $and thereby obtain joy and happiness for seven days and seven nights?” $The Nigaṇṭhas answered, “No, Gotama.” $[I asked further, “Can he, according to his wish, remain in silence, not $speaking a word, and thereby] obtain joy and happiness for six days, ...
$252^taisho587c Division 9$five, ...

or one day and one night?” The $Nigaṇṭhas answered, “No, Gotama.” $I again asked, “Nigaṇṭhas, can I, according to my wish, remain in $silence, not speaking a word, and thereby obtain joy and happiness for $one day and one night?”257 The Nigaṇṭhas answered, “Yes indeed, Gotama.” $[I again asked, “Can I, according to my wish, remain in silence, not speak￾ing a word, and thereby] obtain joy and happiness for two, ...

$four, ...

[If] a learned $noble disciple does not see this as it really is, then he is enveloped by sen￾sual pleasures, entangled in what is evil and unwholesome, and will not $attain the happiness of relinquishment and unsurpassable peace. 
$Mahānāma, in this way a learned noble disciple regresses on account $of sensual pleasures. 
Mahānāma, I know that there is no happiness in sen￾sual pleasures; there is only immeasurable suffering and misery. 
Knowing $this as it really is, I am not enveloped by sensual pleasures, not entangled $by evil and unwholesome states, and thus attain the happiness of relin￾quishment and unsurpassable peace. 
Mahānāma, for this reason I do not $regress on account of sensual pleasures. 
$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, Mahānāma $the Sakyan and the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.

^ck The Discourse on the $Higher State of Mind259$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $253^taisho588a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$If a monk wishes to attain a higher state of mind (adhicitta) then he should $frequently attend to five signs. 
Through frequent attention to these five $signs, unwholesome thoughts that arise will be swiftly extinguished. 
Evil $thoughts having been extinguished, the mind will be constantly established $in inner tranquility; it will become unified and attain concentration. 
$What are the five [signs]? If unwholesome thoughts arise [while] a $monk is giving attention to some sign related to what is wholesome, then $because this [preliminary] sign [has led to the arising of unwholesome $thoughts], he [should] instead attend to a different sign related to what is $wholesome so that evil and unwholesome thoughts will no longer arise. 
$[If,] because the [preliminary] sign [has led to the arising of unwholesome $thoughts], he instead attends to a different sign related to what is wholesome, $then the already arisen unwholesome thoughts will be swiftly extinguished. 
$Evil thoughts having been extinguished, his mind will be constantly estab￾lished in inner tranquility; it will become unified and attain concentration. 
$It is just as a carpenter or a carpenter’s apprentice might apply an inked $string to a piece of wood [to mark a straight line],260 and then trim the $wood with a sharp adze to make it straight.261 In the same way, because $the [preliminary] sign [has led to the arising of unwholesome thoughts], $the monk instead attends to a different sign related to what is wholesome $so that evil and unwholesome thoughts will no longer arise. 
$[If,] because the [preliminary] sign [has led to the arising of unwholesome $thoughts], he instead attends to a different sign related to what is wholesome, $then the already arisen unwholesome thoughts will be swiftly extinguished. 
$Evil thoughts having been extinguished his mind will be constantly estab￾lished in inner tranquility; it will become unified and attain concentration. 
$If a monk wishes to attain a higher state of mind, he should frequently $attend to this [different] first sign. 
Through attention to this sign, arisen $unwholesome thoughts will be swiftly extinguished. 
Evil thoughts having $been extinguished, his mind will be constantly established in inner tran￾quility; it will become unified and attain concentration. 
$Again, if unwholesome thoughts arise [while] a monk is giving attention $to a sign related to what is wholesome, then he [should] contemplate these $thoughts as evil and beset by danger [thus]: “These thoughts are unwhole￾some, these thoughts are evil, these thoughts are abhorred by the wise. 
$254$Division 9$One who is filled with these thoughts will not attain penetration, will not $attain the path to awakening, will not attain nirvana, because they will $cause the arising of [further] evil and unwholesome thoughts.” $[If] he contemplates them in this way as evil, then the already arisen $unwholesome thoughts will be swiftly extinguished. 
Evil thoughts having $been extinguished, his mind will be constantly established in inner tran￾quility; it will become unified and attain concentration. 
$It is just as a young and very handsome person might take a bath and $wash himself,262 dress in clean clothes, apply perfume to his body, and $comb his beard and hair, in order to be spotlessly clean. 
If someone were $to take a dead snake, a dead dog, or a human corpse that has been half $eaten [by animals], of bluish color, swollen and putrefied, with impurities $oozing out, and put [the dead animal or body] around [that young person’s] $neck, then [that person] would abhor the filth, they would not enjoy or $like it. 
In the same way, a monk [should] contemplate these [arisen] $thoughts as evil and beset by danger [thus]: “These thoughts are unwhole￾some, these thoughts are evil, these thoughts are abhorred by the wise. 
$One who is filled with these thoughts will not attain penetration, will not $attain the path to awakening, will not attain nirvana, because they will $cause the arising of [further] evil and unwholesome thoughts.” $[If] he contemplates them in this way as evil, then the unwholesome $thoughts that have already arisen will be swiftly extinguished. 
Evil thoughts $having been extinguished his mind will be constantly established in inner $tranquility; it will become unified and attain concentration. 
$If a monk wishes to attain a higher state of mind, then he should fre￾quently attend to this second sign. 
Through attention to this sign, arisen $unwholesome thoughts will be swiftly extinguished. 
Evil thoughts having $been extinguished, his mind will be constantly established in inner tran￾quility; it will become unified and attain concentration. 
$Again, if unwholesome thoughts arise while a monk is giving attention $to a sign related to what is wholesome, and if while he is contemplating $these thoughts as evil and dangerous unwholesome thoughts again arise, $then that monk should not attend to those thoughts, because they will $cause the arising of [further] evil and unwholesome thoughts. 
$255^taisho588b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$[If] he does not attend to these thoughts, then the unwholesome thoughts $that have already arisen will be swiftly extinguished. 
Evil thoughts having $been extinguished, his mind will be constantly established in inner tran￾quility; it will become unified and attain concentration. 
$It is just as when there are visible forms in a well-lit place and a person $with good eyesight who [has] no wish to see them closes his eyes or turns $away and leaves. 
What do you think? [Those] visible forms being in a $well lit place, will that person be able to receive the image of those forms? $[The monks] answered, “He will not.” $[The Buddha said:] $In the same way, a monk should not attend to these thoughts, because $they will cause the arising of [further] evil and unwholesome thoughts. 
$[If] he does not attend to these thoughts, then the unwholesome thoughts $that have already arisen will be swiftly extinguished. 
Evil thoughts having $been extinguished, his mind will be constantly established in inner tran￾quility; it will become unified and attain concentration. 
$If a monk wishes to attain a higher state of mind, then he should fre￾quently attend to this third sign. 
Through attention to this sign, arisen $unwholesome thoughts will be swiftly extinguished. 
Evil thoughts having $been extinguished, his mind will be constantly established in inner tran￾quility; it will become unified and attain concentration. 
$Again, if unwholesome thoughts arise while the monk is giving attention $to a sign related to what is wholesome; and if, while he is contemplating $these thoughts as evil and dangerous, unwholesome thoughts again arise; $and if, while he is not attending to those thoughts, further unwholesome $thoughts arise; then, in regard to these thoughts, that monk should deploy $his volition to reduce those thoughts gradually so that evil and unwhole￾some thoughts no longer arise. 
$[If] in regard to these thoughts he deploys his volition to reduce the $thoughts gradually, then unwholesome thoughts that have already arisen $will be swiftly extinguished. 
Evil thoughts having been extinguished, his $mind will be constantly established in inner tranquility; it will become $unified and attain concentration. 
$256$Division 9$It is just as someone who is walking quickly, hurrying along, might reflect, $“Why am I hurrying? Wouldn’t I rather walk more slowly now?” and so he $walks slowly. 
Then he reflects again, “Why am I walking slowly? Wouldn’t $I rather stand still?” and so he stands still. 
Then he reflects again, “Why am $I standing? Wouldn’t I rather sit down?” and so he sits down. 
Then he reflects $again, “Why am I sitting? Wouldn’t I rather lie down?” and so he lies down. 
$In this way that person gradually calms his bodily gross activities. 
$It should be understood that the monk, too, is like that [when], in regard $to these thoughts, he deploys his volition to reduce those thoughts gradually $so that evil and unwholesome thoughts no longer arise. 
$[If,] in regard to these thoughts, he deploys his volition to reduce the $thoughts gradually, then the unwholesome thoughts that have already $arisen will be swiftly extinguished. 
Evil thoughts having been extinguished, $his mind will be constantly established in inner tranquility; it will become $unified and attain concentration. 
$If a monk wishes to attain a higher state of mind, then he should fre￾quently attend to this fourth sign. 
Through attention to this sign, unwhole￾some thoughts that have already arisen will be swiftly extinguished. 
Evil $thoughts having been extinguished, his mind will be constantly established $in inner tranquility; it will become unified and attain concentration. 
$Again, if unwholesome thoughts arise while the monk is giving attention $to a sign related to what is wholesome; and if, while he is contemplating $these thoughts as evil and dangerous, unwholesome thoughts also arise; $and if, while he is not attending to those thoughts, further unwholesome $thoughts arise; and if when he deploys his volition to reduce those thoughts $gradually, unwholesome thoughts again arise; then that monk should con￾template thus: “If, owing to these thoughts, unwholesome thoughts arise $in a monk, then that monk should, with teeth clenched and tongue pressed $against his palate, use mind to control mind, taking hold of it and subduing $it, so that evil and unwholesome thoughts no longer arise.” $[If] he uses mind to control mind, taking hold of it and subduing it, $then the unwholesome thoughts that have already arisen will be swiftly $extinguished. 
Evil thoughts having been extinguished, his mind will be $constantly established in inner tranquility; it will become unified and attain $concentration. 
$257^taisho588c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$It is just as two strong men might seize a weaker man, taking hold of $him and subduing him. 
In the same way a monk, with teeth clenched and $tongue pressed against his palate, uses mind to control mind, taking hold $of it and subduing it so that evil and unwholesome thoughts no longer arise. 
$[If] he uses mind to control mind, taking hold of it and subduing it, $then the unwholesome thoughts that have already arisen will be swiftly $extinguished. 
Evil thoughts having been extinguished, his mind will be $constantly established in inner tranquility; it will become unified and attain $concentration. 
$If a monk wishes to attain a higher state of mind, then he should fre￾quently attend to this fifth sign. 
Through attention to this sign, unwhole￾some thoughts that have already arisen will be swiftly extinguished. 
Evil $thoughts having been extinguished, his mind will be constantly established $in inner tranquility; it will become unified and attain concentration. 
$If a monk wishes to attain a higher state of mind, he should frequently $attend to these five signs. 
Through frequent attention to these five signs, $unwholesome thoughts that have already arisen will be swiftly extin￾guished. 
Evil thoughts having been extinguished, his mind will be con￾stantly established in inner tranquility; it will become unified and attain $concentration. 
$If when a monk gives attention to a sign related to what is wholesome, $evil thoughts no longer arise; [if] when he contemplates [evil] thoughts $as evil and dangerous, evil thoughts also no longer arise; [if] when he $does not attend to [evil] thoughts, evil thoughts also no longer arise; if $when he deploys his volition to reduce [evil] thoughts gradually, evil $thoughts also no longer arise; [and] if when he uses mind to control mind, $taking hold of it and subduing it, evil thoughts also no longer arise—then $he has attained self-mastery. 
He thinks what he wishes to think and does $not think what he does not wish to think. 
$If a monk thinks what he wishes to think and does not think what he $does not wish to think, then he is reckoned as a monk who thinks according $to his wish, who has mastery of the courses of thought.263$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks $were delighted and received it respectfully. 
$258^taisho589a Division 9$102. 
^ck The Discourse $on Thoughts264$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $Formerly, when I had not yet awakened to unsurpassable, right, and total $awakening, I had this thought: “Let me divide my thoughts into two parts, $with thoughts of sensual desire, thoughts of ill-will, and thoughts of cruelty $as one part, and thoughts without sensual desire, thoughts without ill-will, $and thoughts without cruelty as the other part.” $Thereafter I divided all my thoughts into two parts, with thoughts of $sensual desire, thoughts of ill-will, and thoughts of harming as one part, $and thoughts without sensual desire, thoughts without ill-will, and thoughts $without harming as the other part. 
$Practicing like this, I went and stayed in a remote and secluded place, $practicing diligently with a mind free of negligence. 
[If] a thought of sen￾sual desire arose, I at once realized “A thought of sensual desire has arisen, $which is harmful to myself, harmful to others, harmful to both, which will $destroy wisdom, cause much trouble, and not [lead to] attaining nirvana.” $On realizing that it was harmful to myself, harmful to others, harmful to $both, would destroy wisdom, cause much trouble, and not [lead to] attaining $nirvana, it rapidly ceased. 
$Again, [if] a thought of ill-will, ...
[or] a thought of cruelty arose, I $at once realized “A thought of ill-will, ...
[or] a thought of cruelty has $arisen, which is harmful to myself, harmful to others, harmful to both, $which will destroy wisdom, cause much trouble, and not [lead to] attaining $nirvana.” [When I] realized that it was harmful to myself, harmful to $others, harmful to both, would destroy wisdom, cause much trouble, and $not [lead to] attaining nirvana, it rapidly ceased. 
$[If] a thought of sensual desire arose in me, I did not accept it but aban￾doned it, discarded it, vomited it out. 
[If] a thought of ill-will, ...
[or] a $thought of cruelty arose, I did not accept it but abandoned it, discarded $it, and vomited it out. 
Why was that? Because I saw that countless evil $unwholesome states would certainly arise because of [such thoughts]. 
$259$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$It is just as in the last month of spring when, because the fields have $been sown, the area where cows can graze is limited, and a cowherd, having $set the cows free in uncultivated marshland, wields a cane to prevent them $from straying into others’ fields. 
Why is that? Because the cowherd knows $that he would certainly be scolded, beaten, or imprisoned [if the cows] $trespassed. 
For this reason, the cowherd wields a cane to prevent it. 
$In the same way, [if] a thought of sensual desire arose in me, I did not $accept it but abandoned it, discarded it, and vomited it out. 
[If] a thought $of ill-will, ...
[or] a thought of cruelty arose, I did not accept it but aban￾doned it, discarded it, and vomited it out. 
Why was that? Because I saw $that countless evil and unwholesome states would certainly arise because $of [such thoughts]. 
$Monks, in accordance with what one intends, in accordance with what $one thinks, the mind takes delight in that. 
If a monk often thinks thoughts $of sensual desire and abandons thoughts without sensual desire, then through $often thinking thoughts of sensual desire his mind takes delight in them. 
$If a monk often thinks thoughts of ill-will, ...
[or] thoughts of cruelty $and abandons thoughts without ill-will, ...
[or] thoughts without cruelty, $then through often thinking thoughts of ill-will, ...
[or] thoughts of cruelty $his mind takes delight in them. 
$Thus a monk who has not abandoned thoughts of sensual desire, not $abandoned thoughts of ill-will, and not abandoned thoughts of cruelty $will be unable to free himself from birth, old age, disease, death, worry $and sorrow, weeping and tears; he will not be able to free himself from $all this dukkha.265$Practicing in this way, I went and stayed in a remote and secluded $place, practicing diligently with a mind free of negligence. 
[If] a thought $without sensual desire arose in me, I at once realized, “A thought without $sensual desire has arisen, which is not harmful to myself, not harmful to $others, not harmful to both, which will [lead to] developing wisdom $without difficulty, and to attaining nirvana.” On realizing that it was not $harmful to myself, not harmful to others, not harmful to both, and that it $would [lead to] developing wisdom without difficulty and to attaining $nirvana, I rapidly developed it and made much of it. 
$260^taisho589b Division 9$Again, [if] a thought without ill-will, ...
[or] a thought without cruelty $arose in me, I at once realized, “A thought without ill-will, ...

$I further had this thought: “If I intentionally keep on thinking my body $will lose strength and my mind will be troubled. 
Let me rather keep my $mind in check within, continuously dwelling in inner tranquility, unified, $having attained concentration, so that my mind will not be troubled.” $Thereafter I kept my mind in check within, continuously dwelling in $inner tranquility, unified, having attained concentration, and my mind was $no longer troubled. 
$[If] a thought without sensual desire arose in me, I further [allowed] $thoughts to arise that were inclined toward the Dharma and in accordance $with the Dharma. 
[If] a thought without ill-will, ...
[or] a thought without $cruelty arose, I further [allowed] thoughts to arise that were inclined $toward the Dharma and in accordance with the Dharma. 
Why was that? $[Because] I did not see that countless evil and unwholesome states would $arise because of [such thoughts]. 
$It is just as in the last month of autumn, when the entire harvest has $been collected, a cowherd boy sets the cows free in the uncultivated fields $and is mindful of them, thinking, “My cows are there in the herd.” Why $is that? Because the cowherd boy does not see that he would be scolded, $beaten, or imprisoned for any trespassing. 
For this reason he is mindful $of them thus, “My cows are there in the herd.” $In the same way, [if] a thought without sensual desire arose in me, I $further [allowed] thoughts to arise that were inclined to the Dharma and $in accordance with the Dharma. 
[If] a thought without ill-will, ...
[or] a $thought without cruelty arose, I further [allowed] thoughts to arise that $261^taisho589c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$were inclined to the Dharma and in accordance with the Dharma. 
Why $was that? [Because] I did not see that countless evil and unwholesome $states would arise because of [such thoughts]. 
$Monks, in accordance with what one intends, in accordance with what $one thinks, the mind takes delight in that. 
If a monk often thinks thoughts $without sensual desire and abandons thoughts of sensual desire, then $because of often thinking thoughts without sensual desire his mind takes $delight in them. 
$If a monk often thinks thoughts without ill-will, ...
[or] thoughts $without cruelty, and abandons thoughts of ill-will, ...
[or] thoughts of $cruelty, then because of often thinking thoughts without ill-will, ...
[or] $thoughts without cruelty his mind takes delight in them.266$With the calming of [directed] awareness and [sustained] contemplation, $with inner stillness and mental unification, he dwells having attained the $second absorption, which is without [directed] awareness and [sustained] $contemplation and with rapture and happiness born of concentration. 
$Secluded from rapture and pleasure, dwelling in equanimity and without $seeking anything, with right mindfulness and right comprehension, expe￾riencing happiness with the body, he dwells having attained the third $absorption, which the noble ones speak of as noble equanimity and mind￾fulness, a happy abode. 
$With the cessation of pleasure and the cessation of pain, and with the $earlier cessation of rapture and displeasure, with neither pain nor pleasure, $and with purity of mindfulness and equanimity, he dwells having attained $the fourth absorption. 
$With his mind concentrated and purified in this way, free of defilements, $free of troubles, malleable, well-steadied, having gained imperturbability, $he directs it to the realization of the higher knowledge of the destruction $of the taints.267$He knows as it really is: “This is dukkha”; he knows [as it really is]: $“This is the arising of dukkha”; he knows [as it really is]: “This is the ces￾sation of dukkha”; he knows as it really is: “This is the path [leading to] $the cessation of dukkha.” $He knows as it really is: “These are the taints”; he knows [as it really $is]: “This is the arising of the taints”; he knows [as it really is]: “This is $262$Division 9$the cessation of the taints”; he knows as it really is: “This is the path [lead￾ing] to the cessation of the taints.” $Knowing like this and seeing like this, his mind is liberated from the $taint of sensual desire, from the taint of existence, and from the taint of $ignorance. 
Being liberated, he knows that he is liberated, knowing as it $really is: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what had to $be done has been done, there will not be another experiencing of exis￾tence.” $This monk, being free from thoughts of sensual desire, free from $thoughts of ill-will, and free from thoughts of cruelty, attains liberation $from birth, old age, disease, death, worry and sorrow, weeping and tears. 
$He is free from all dukkha.$It is just as if a herd of deer is living in a secluded area where there is $a large spring. 
A man comes along who does not seek the benefit and wel￾fare of that herd of deer, does not seek their safety and happiness. 
He $blocks the right path and opens up a false path, digs a pit [as a trap], and $gets someone to keep watch over it. 
In this way the entire herd of deer $will be [trapped and] killed. 
$Suppose another man comes along, who does seek the benefit and wel￾fare of that herd of deer and seeks their safety and happiness. 
He opens $up the right path, blocks off the bad path, and drives the watchman away. 
$In this way the entire herd of deer will remains safe and sound. 
$Monks, you should know that I have spoken this simile wishing you $to know its meaning. 
On hearing a simile a wise person understands its $implications. 
This is the meaning of this saying: The large spring represents $the five cords of sensual pleasure that are agreeable, yearned for, and $delighted in. 
$What are the five? They are visible forms perceived by the eye, sounds $perceived by the ear, odors perceived by the nose, flavors perceived by $the tongue, and tangibles perceived by the body. 
You should know that $“the large spring” represents these five sensual pleasures. 
$You should [also] know that the great herd of deer [represents] renun￾ciants and brahmins. 
You should [also] know that the one man who comes $along and does not seek their benefit and welfare, their safety and happi￾ness, [represents] Māra, the Evil One. 
Blocking the right path and opening $263^taisho590a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$up a bad path [represents] the three evil and unwholesome types of thought: $thoughts of sensual desire, thoughts of ill-will, and thoughts of cruelty. 
$You should know that the evil path [represents] these three evil and $unwholesome thoughts. 
Again, there is another evil path, namely the eight￾fold wrong path: wrong view, ...
up to ...
wrong concentration; these $are the eight.268 You should [also] know that the great pit [represents] igno￾rance. 
You should [also] know that the watchman [represents] the retinue $of Māra, the Evil One.269$You should [also] know that the other man who comes along, seeking $the benefit and welfare [of that herd of deer], seeking their safety and hap￾piness, [represents] the Tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened. 
$Opening up the right path and blocking the evil path [represents] the three $wholesome thoughts: thoughts without sensual desire, thoughts without $ill-will, and thoughts without cruelty. 
You should know that the path [rep￾resents] these three wholesome thoughts. 
Again, there is another path, $namely the eightfold right path: right view, ...
up to ...
right concentration; $these are the eight. 
$Monks, I have opened up the right path for you and blocked off the $evil path; I have filled in the pit and driven away the watchman. 
What a $teacher should do for his disciples out of great compassion, mercy, sym￾pathy, and concern, seeking their benefit and welfare, seeking their safety $and happiness, I have now already done. 
$You, too, should do your part. 
Go and sit in meditation in a secluded $place, on a mountain, in a forest, at the base of a tree, in an empty and $quiet place. 
Do not be negligent, make diligent effort, lest you regret it $later. 
This is my instruction, this is my teaching. 
$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks $were delighted and received it respectfully.

^ck The Discourse on $the Lion’s Roar270$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying among the Kurus, $at a Kuru town called Kammāsadhamma. 
$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $264^taisho590b Division 9$When you are among assemblies, you can roar a true lion’s roar like $this: “In this [dispensation] there is a first[-level] renunciant, a second[-$level], ...

Outside of $this [dispensation] there is no [true] renunciant or brahmin; all heterodox $paths [of practice] are devoid of [true] renunciants and brahmins’?” $Monks, you should reply to those heterodox practitioners like this: “Ven￾erable friends, our World-honored One is endowed with knowledge and vision, $he is a tathāgata, free of attachment, fully awakened. 
He has declared four $principles, and it is because of these four principles that we make such a $proclamation when among assemblies, roaring a true lion’s roar like this: ‘In $this [dispensation] there is a first[-level] renunciant, a second[-level], ...

$“Venerable friends, regarding these two dispensations, that of the renun￾ciant Gotama and that of ourselves, what is superior [or inferior], what is $their significance, and what are the differences?” $Monks, you should ask the heterodox practitioners this: “Venerable $friends, is there a single final goal or are there many final goals?” $Monks, if the heterodox practitioners reply like this, “Venerable friends, $there is a single final goal; there are not many final goals,” then, monks, $ask the heterodox practitioners further, “Venerable friends, is the final $goal attained by one who has sensual desires or is the final goal attained $by one who is without sensual desires?” $Monks, if the heterodox practitioners reply like this, “Venerable friends, $the final goal is to be attained by one who is without sensual desires; the $final goal is not attained by one who has sensual desires,” then, monks, $ask the heterodox practitioners further: “Venerable friends, is the final $goal attained by one who has ill-will or is the final goal attained by one $who is without ill-will?” $Monks, if the heterodox practitioners reply like this, “Venerable friends, $the final goal is attained by one who is without ill-will; the final goal is $not attained by one who has ill-will,” then, monks, ask the heterodox prac￾titioners further: “Venerable friends, is the final goal attained by one who $has delusion or is the final goal attained by one who is without delusion?” $Monks, if the heterodox practitioners reply like this, “Venerable friends, $the final goal is attained by one who is without delusion; the final goal is $not attained by one who has delusion,” then, monks, ask the heterodox $practitioners further: “Venerable friends, is the final goal attained by one $who has craving and clinging, or is the final goal attained by one who is $without craving and clinging?”272$266^taisho590c Division 9$Monks, if the heterodox practitioners reply like this, “Venerable friends, $the final goal is attained by one who is without craving and clinging; the $final goal is not attained by one who has craving and clinging,” then, monks, $ask the heterodox practitioners further: “Venerable friends, is the final goal $attained by one who is without wisdom and does not speak wisely, or is $the final goal attained by one who has wisdom and speaks wisely?” $Monks, if the heterodox practitioners reply like this, “Venerable friends, $the final goal is attained by one who has wisdom and speaks wisely; the $final goal is not attained by one who is without wisdom and does not speak $wisely,” then, monks, ask the heterodox practitioners further, “Venerable $friends, is the final goal attained by one who is hostile and disputatious, $or is the final goal attained by one who is not hostile and not disputatious?” $Monks, if the heterodox practitioners reply like this, “Venerable friends, $the final goal is attained by one who is not hostile and not disputatious; $the final goal is not attained by one who is hostile and disputatious,” then, $monks, say this to the heterodox practitioners: “Venerable friends, accord￾ing to what you have said, there is a single final goal; there are not many $final goals.

$Renunciants and brahmins who do not know the cause [of these two $views], who do not know their arising, do not know their cessation, do $not know the gratification in them, do not know the danger in them, and $do not know the escape from them—they all have sensual desire, they $have ill-will and delusion, they have craving, they have clinging, they are $without wisdom and do not speak wisely, and they are hostile and dispu￾tatious.

$They declare the abandoning of clinging to sensual pleasures but they do $not declare the abandoning of clinging to rules, clinging to views, and $clinging to a self.273 Why is that? $Those renunciants and brahmins do not know these three instances [of $clinging] as they really are; consequently, although they declare the aban￾doning of clinging, they do not declare the abandoning of all [types of] $clinging.

$He declares the abandoning of clinging, declaring here and now the $abandoning of all [types] of clinging. 
He declares the abandoning of cling￾ing to sensual pleasures, of clinging to rules, of clinging to views, and of $clinging to a self. 
$What is the cause of these four [types] of clinging? From what do they $arise? From where are they born? What is their source?

Not clinging, he is not agitated; being $without agitation and having abandoned its cause and condition, he is cer￾tain to attain final nirvana, knowing as it really is: “Birth has been ended, $the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, $there will not be another experiencing of existence.” $In such a true Dharma and discipline, if someone has faith in the teacher, $that is appropriate and [leads to the] highest; if someone has faith in the $teaching, that is appropriate and [leads to the] highest; if someone is $endowed with the virtues of the precepts, that is appropriate and [leads $to the] highest; if someone feels affection and respect towards companions $on the path, revering and supporting them, that is appropriate and [leads $to the] highest.

Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks $were delighted and received it respectfully. 
$104. 
^ck The Discourse in the $Udumbara [Forest]276$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha, in the $Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. 
$At that time there was a householder called True Mind,277 who in the early $morning had left Rājagaha with the intention of approaching the Buddha and $paying homage to him. 
$Then the householder True Mind thought, “For the time being, never mind $about approaching the Buddha. 
The World-honored One and the monks may $[still] be sitting in meditation. 
Let me rather go to the udumbara forest and $approach the park of the heterodox practitioners.” Then the householder True $Mind went to the udumbara forest and approached the park of the heterodox $practitioners. 
$270^taisho591c Division 9$At that time in the park of the heterodox practitioners in the udumbara forest there was one heterodox practitioner named Nigrodha,278 who was $respected as a teacher among the heterodox practitioners, held in reverence $by people as one who had vanquished many [opponents] and was the leader $of five hundred heterodox practitioners. 
$He was with a disorderly assembly that was making a great uproar, engag￾ing in various types of animal talk,279 discussions [about such things as] talk $about kings, talk about thieves, talk about battles, talk about food and drink, $talk about clothes and blankets, talk about married women, talk about girls, $talk about adulterous women, talk about worldly customs, talk about wrong $ways of practice, talk about the ocean, and talk about the country. 
They were $all seated together there talking these various types of animal talk. 
$When the heterodox practitioner Nigrodha saw the householder True $Mind coming in the distance, he admonished his followers, telling them all $to be silent: $Venerable friends, be silent! Don’t talk! Enjoy being silent! Let each one $control himself! $Why is that? The householder True Mind, a disciple of the renunciant $Gotama, is coming. 
Among the disciples of the renunciant Gotama who $have a high reputation for virtue and are worthy of respect, and who live $as householders at Rājagaha, he is the foremost. 
He does not speak [much] $but enjoys silence and practices self-restraint. 
If he knows that this assembly $is established in silence, he will probably approach us. 
$Then, having silenced his assembly, the heterodox practitioner Nigrodha $became silent himself. 
Then the householder True Mind approached the het￾erodox practitioner Nigrodha, exchanged friendly greetings, stepped back, $and sat to one side. 
He said: $Nigrodha, our World-honored One makes a practice of sitting in meditation $beneath a tree in some secluded area or mountain forest, or while dwelling $on some high crag, in an isolated [place] without noise, remote, without $disturbance, and without people. 
$This is the nature of the Buddha, the World-honored One. 
He makes $a practice of sitting in meditation beneath a tree in some secluded area or $271$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$mountain forest, or while dwelling on some high crag, in an isolated $[place] without noise, remote, without disturbance, and without people. 
$He always enjoys sitting in meditation in remote areas, at peace and happy. 
$Since the beginning the Buddha, the World-honored One, has never $met together with a large group, day and night, as you are doing today $with your retinue. 
$At this the heterodox practitioner Nigrodha said: $Stop, householder, stop! How would you know? The renunciant Gotama $is devoid of wisdom and liberation. 
You have no adequate basis for saying $whether [his conduct] is appropriate or not, whether it is reasonable or not. 
$That renunciant Gotama keeps to the fringes [of populated areas], $enjoying the fringes and dwelling on the fringes. 
Just as a blind ox grazes $on the fringes and keeps to the fringes, enjoying the fringes and dwelling $on the fringes, it is like this too with the renunciant Gotama. 
Householder, $if that renunciant Gotama were to come to this assembly, I would destroy $him with a single argument, just as one might [smash] an empty pot, and $I would tell him the simile of the blind ox. 
$Then the heterodox practitioner Nigrodha addressed his assembly: $Venerable friends, suppose the renunciant Gotama were to come to this $assembly—if he must come, then don’t show him respect by getting up $from your seats and extending your hands, with palms joined, toward $him; and don’t invite him to sit on a prepared seat. 
When he arrives, say $something like, “Gotama, there are seats. 
Sit where you like!”280$At that time the World-honored One was sitting in meditation, and with $the purified divine ear that surpasses [the hearing ability of ordinary] people $he overheard this conversation between the householder True Mind and the $heterodox practitioner Nigrodha. 
$Then, in the late afternoon, he rose from sitting in meditation and $approached the park of the heterodox practitioners in the udumbara forest. 
$When the heterodox practitioner Nigrodha saw the World-honored One com￾ing in the distance, he got up from his seat, arranged his robe so as to bare $one shoulder and, extending his hands with palms joined toward the Buddha, $272^taisho592a Division 9$he graciously said, “Welcome, renunciant Gotama! It is a long time since $you have been here. 
Please take this seat!” $Then the World-honored One thought, “This foolish man disregards his $own instructions.” Knowing this, the World-honored One sat down on that $seat. 
The heterodox practitioner Nigrodha exchanged polite greetings with $the World-honored One, stepped back, and sat to one side. 
$The World-honored One said, “Nigrodha, what topic have you been $discussing with the householder True Mind? On account of what matter are $you seated here together?” $The heterodox practitioner Nigrodha replied: $Gotama, we had this thought: “What are the teachings with which the $renunciant Gotama instructs his disciples, such that his disciples, having $been instructed, attain well-being and spend the rest of their lives practicing $the holy life in purity and teaching it to others?” $Gotama, this is the topic that I have been discussing with the house￾holder True Mind; this is the matter on account of which we are seated $here together.281$On hearing these words, the householder True Mind thought, “How strange $that this heterodox practitioner Nigrodha should be speaking a falsehood! $Why is that? He is right in front of the Buddha trying to deceive the World￾honored One.” $Knowing this, the World-honored One said: $Nigrodha, my teachings are profound, remarkable, and special. 
They are $difficult to realize, difficult to know, difficult to see, and difficult to attain—$that is to say, the teachings with which I instruct my disciples, such that $having been so instructed my disciples spend the rest of their lives prac￾ticing the holy life in purity and teaching it to others. 
$Nigrodha, if you have any questions about the practice of self-morti-$fication taught by your own teachers, then ask me. 
I will certainly be able $to answer to your satisfaction. 
$At this the disorderly assembly of heterodox practitioners all exclaimed $in unison: $273^taisho592b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$The renunciant Gotama is remarkable and special, with great supernormal $power, great virtue, great merit, and great dignity! Why is that? He is able $to let go of his own doctrine and answer questions asked in terms of $another’s doctrine. 
$At this, the heterodox practitioner Nigrodha admonished his assembly, $telling them to be quiet. 
He asked, “Gotama, how does self-mortification $reach fulfilment, and how does it not reach fulfilment?” $Then the World-honored One replied: $Nigrodha, there are some renunciants or brahmins who go around naked, $unclothed, or who use their hands as clothing [to cover their private parts], $or use leaves as clothing, or use beads as clothing; who abstain from using $a pot to get water, or abstain from using a ladle to get water; who do not $eat food that has been stolen with a knife or cudgel, who do not eat food $[obtained] by cheating, or [that has been obtained] themselves by approaching $[a donor], or by sending a messenger [to the donor], or [on hearing a donor $say,] “Come, venerable sir!” or “Very well, venerable sir!” or “Stay, venerable $sir!”; or who do not eat food when there are two people eating together, or $food from the house of a pregnant woman, or from a house with a domestic $dog, or who do not eat food from a house where there are excrement-eating $flies; or who do not eat fish, do not eat meat, do not drink wine, do not drink $bad water, or who do not drink anything at all, training in the practice of $not drinking; who eat [only] one mouthful and are content with one mouthful, $or eat [only] two, ...

$282^taisho594b Division 9$Nigrodha, have I not told you how the fulfilment of this self-mortifi-$cation does not become polluted by countless defilements? $The heterodox practitioner Nigrodha replied, “Indeed, Gotama has told $me how the fulfilment of this self-mortification does not become polluted $by countless defilements.” $The heterodox practitioner Nigrodha asked, “Gotama, does this self-mor￾tification reach the highest?

$The heterodox practitioner Nigrodha asked again, “Gotama, how does $this self-mortification reach the outer skin?” $The World-honored One replied: $Nigrodha, suppose that a renunciant or brahmin undertakes four practices: $not killing living beings, not instructing others to kill, and not approving $of killing; not stealing, not instructing others to steal, and not approving $of stealing; not taking another’s wife, not instructing others to take another’s $wife, and not approving of others taking another’s wife; not speaking $falsehoods, not instructing others to speak falsehoods, and not approving $of speaking falsehoods.

He sees as it really is that, if these living beings undertook $evil bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, if they reviled noble ones, held $wrong views, and undertook actions [based on] wrong views, then because $of these causes and conditions at the breaking up of the body at death they $certainly go to a bad realm of existence, and are reborn in hell. 
$If, [however,] these living beings undertook good bodily, verbal, and $mental conduct, if they did not revile noble ones, held right views, and $undertook actions [based on] right views, then because of these causes $and conditions at the breaking up of the body after death they certainly $ascend to a good realm of existence, and are reborn in heavenly realms. 
$Nigrodha, what do you think: has this kind of self-mortification reached $the highest? Has it reached the true essence? $Nigrodha replied: $Gotama, this kind of self-mortification has reached the highest; it has $reached the true essence. 
Gotama, is it for realizing this self-mortification $that the disciples of the renunciant Gotama practice the holy life in depend￾ence on the renunciant [Gotama]? $The World-honored One replied: $Nigrodha, it is not for realizing this self-mortification that my disciples $practice the holy life in dependence on me. 
Nigrodha, there is something $285$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$else that is supremely superior, supremely sublime, supremely excellent, $for the realization of which my disciples practice the holy life in depend￾ence on me. 
$At this the disorderly assembly of heterodox practitioners exclaimed $loudly: $It is like this, it is like this! The realization of that is why the disciples of $the renunciant Gotama practice the holy life in dependence on the renun￾ciant Gotama!288$Then the heterodox practitioner Nigrodha admonished his assembly. 
Hav￾ing quietened them, he asked: $Gotama, what is that something else that is supremely superior, supremely $sublime, supremely excellent, for the realization of which the disciples $of the renunciant Gotama practice the holy life in dependence on the $renunciant Gotama? $Then the World-honored One said: $Nigrodha, the Tathāgata arises in the world, free from attachment, fully $awakened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, a well-gone one, a $knower of the world, an unsurpassable person, leader on the path of Dharma, $teacher of devas and human beings, called a buddha, an exalted one. 
$[A disciple of the Tathāgata] abandons the five hindrances that defile the $mind and weaken wisdom. 
Secluded from sensual desires, secluded from $evil and unwholesome states, he dwells having attained ...
up to ...
the $fourth absorption.289$With his mind concentrated and purified in this way, without defilement, $without affliction, malleable, well steadied, having gained imperturbability, $he directs his mind toward knowledge and realization of the destruction $of the taints. 
$He knows as it really is: “This is dukkha.” He knows [as it really is]: $“This is the arising of dukkha.” He knows [as it really is]: “This is the $cessation of dukkha.” He knows as it really is: “This is the path to the ces￾sation of dukkha.” $286^taisho595a Division 9$He knows as it really is: “These are the taints.” He knows [as it really $is]: “This is the arising of the taints.” He knows [as it really is]: “This is $the cessation of the taints.” He knows as it really is: “This is the path to $the cessation of the taints.” $Knowing like this, seeing like this, his mind is liberated from the taint $of sensual desire, ...
from the taint of existence, his mind is liberated $from the taint of ignorance. 
It being liberated, he knows that it is liberated, $knowing as it really is: “Birth has been ended, the holy life has been estab￾lished, what had to be done has been done, there will not be another expe￾riencing of existence.” $Nigrodha, this is reckoned as something else that is supremely superior, $supremely sublime, supremely excellent, for the realization of which my $disciples practice the holy life in dependence on me.

$On hearing this, the World-honored One asked the heterodox practitioner $Nigrodha, “Did you really speak like this?” The heterodox practitioner $Nigrodha replied, “I really [spoke] like this, Gotama.” $The World-honored One asked again: $Nigrodha, haven’t you heard this from senior and former practitioners? $“Tathāgatas of the past, free from attachment, fully awakened, made a $practice of sitting in meditation beneath a tree in a secluded area or moun￾tain forest, or while dwelling on a high crag, in an isolated [place] without $noise, remote, without disturbance, and without people.

$Then the World-honored One said to the householder True Mind: $See how this large assembly remains silent. 
Why is that? Because they $are under the control of King Māra. 
Because of him, among this assembly $of heterodox practitioners there is not a single heterodox practitioner who $thinks: “Let me try cultivating the holy life under the renunciant Gotama.” $Knowing this, the World-honored One taught the Dharma to the house￾holder True Mind, exhorting, inspiring, and fully delighting him. 
Having $exhorted, inspired, and fully delighted him by teaching him the Dharma using $countless skillful means, [the Buddha] rose from his seat. 
Then, taking the $householder True Mind by the arm, he flew up into the air using supernormal $power and departed.293$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the house￾holder True Mind was delighted and received it respectfully.

At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time there was a monk who was living alone, in seclusion, staying $in a remote and quiet place.295 While sitting in meditation and reflecting, he $had this thought, “The World-honored One has comforted me with his words $and taught me the Dharma. 
[Accordingly,] I have fulfilled the precepts, do $not neglect absorption, am accomplished in insight, and dwell in empty and $quiet places.” Then, having had this thought, in the late afternoon that monk $rose from sitting in meditation and approached the Buddha.296$On seeing that monk coming in the distance, the World-honored One, on $account of that monk [who was approaching], told the [assembled] monks: $Should you wish, “May the World-honored One comfort me with his words $and teach me the Dharma!”, then fulfill the precepts, do not neglect absorp￾tion, be accomplished in insight, and dwell in empty and quiet places.297$Monks, should you wish, “On my account may my relatives, on the $breaking up of the body at death, definitely ascend to a good realm of $existence by being reborn in a heavenly realm!”, then fulfill the precepts, $do not neglect absorption, be accomplished in insight, and dwell in empty $and quiet places.

$Monks, should you wish, “May I be able to endure hunger and thirst, $cold and heat, mosquitoes and gadflies, flies and fleas, the impact of wind $and sun, evil words and [even] being beaten with sticks; may I also be $able to bear disease that afflicts the body with extreme pain and suffering, $enough to make me wish to end my life; also any [other] disagreeable $[experience]—may I be able to bear them all!”, then fulfill the precepts, $do not neglect absorption, be accomplished in insight, and dwell in empty $and quiet places.

$Then the monks, having heard what the Buddha said, received it well and $remembered it well. 
Rising from their seats, they paid homage with their $heads at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and left.

At one time, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $A monk who dwells in dependence on a certain forest [contemplates thus]: $“While I am dwelling in dependence on this forest, it may be that, lacking $right mindfulness, I will attain right mindfulness; that having a mind with￾out concentration, I will attain a concentrated mind; that not being liberated, $I will attain liberation; that not having brought the taints to cessation, I $will attain the cessation of the taints; that not having attained the unsur￾passable peace of nirvana, I will attain nirvana; [also] that everything $needed by one who is training in the path—robes and blankets, food and $drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, all the requisites of life—all of $that will be obtained easily, without difficulty.” $That monk [therefore] dwells in dependence on that forest. 
Having $dwelled in dependence on that forest, if he was lacking right mindfulness, $he does not attain right mindfulness; having a mind without concentration, $he does not attain concentration of the mind; not being liberated, he does $not attain liberation; not having brought the taints to cessation, he does $not attain the cessation of the taints; not having attained the unsurpassable $peace of nirvana, he does not attain nirvana; [however] everything needed $by one who is training in the path—robes and blankets, food and drink, $beds and bedding, and medicine, all the requisites of life—all of that is $obtained easily, without difficulty.301$That monk should contemplate thus: “I have left the household life to $train in the path, not for the sake of robes and blankets, not for the sake $of food and drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, and also not for the $295^taisho597a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$sake of all the requisites of life. 
While dwelling in dependence on this $forest, lacking right mindfulness, I do not attain right mindfulness; having $a mind without concentration, I do not attain a concentrated mind; not $being liberated, I do not attain liberation; not having brought the taints to $cessation, I do not attain the cessation of the taints; not having attained $the unsurpassable peace of nirvana, I do not attain nirvana, [though] every￾thing needed by one who is training in the path—robes and blankets, food $and drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, all the requisites of life—all $of that is obtained easily, without difficulty.” That monk, having contem￾plated like this, should abandon that forest and leave.

^ck The [First] Discourse on $Examining One’s Own Mind305$Thus have I heard. 
At one time, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $If a monk is not able to skillfully examine the minds of others, then he $should skillfully examine his own mind; he should train himself like this.306$How does a monk skillfully examine his own mind? A monk will certainly $ensure much benefit for himself if he contemplates like this: “Have I attained $inner tranquility while not having attained supreme wisdom of insight into $phenomena? Have I attained supreme wisdom of insight into phenomena $while not having attained inner tranquility? Have I attained neither inner $tranquility nor supreme wisdom of insight into phenomena? Have I attained $both inner tranquility and supreme wisdom of insight into phenomena?” $If a monk, having examined himself, knows: “I have attained inner tran￾quility while not having attained supreme wisdom of insight into phenom￾ena,” then this monk, having attained inner tranquility, should strive to attain $supreme wisdom of insight into phenomena. 
Later, having attained inner $tranquility, he also attains supreme wisdom of insight into phenomena. 
$If a monk, having examined himself, knows: “I have attained supreme $wisdom of insight into phenomena while not having attained inner tranquility,” $then that monk, having attained supreme wisdom of insight into phenomena, $should strive to attain inner tranquility. 
Later, having attained supreme wisdom $of insight into phenomena, he also attains inner tranquility. 
$If a monk, having examined himself, knows: “I have attained neither $inner tranquility nor supreme wisdom of insight into phenomena,” then such $a monk, having not yet attained these wholesome states, because of wanting $to attain them, should strive quickly by every means, training with utmost $diligence, relentlessly, with right mindfulness and right comprehension. 
$It is just as a person whose head is on fire or whose clothes are on fire $would quickly seek means to save his head and save his clothes. 
In the $302$Division 10$same way, a monk who has not yet attained these wholesome states, due $to wanting to attain them should strive quickly by every means, training $with utmost diligence, relentlessly, with right mindfulness and right com￾prehension. 
Later, having attained inner tranquility, he also attains supreme $wisdom of insight into phenomena. 
$If a monk, having examined himself, knows, “I have attained inner $tranquility and also attained supreme wisdom of insight into phenomena,” $then that monk, established in these wholesome states, should strive to $realize the higher knowledge of the destruction of the taints. 
Why is that? $I say of robes that not every one of them can be kept, [but] I also say $of robes that every one of them can be kept. 
What kind of robe do I say $cannot be kept? If by the keeping of a [certain] robe evil and unwholesome $states increase and wholesome states decrease, then I say that kind of robe $cannot be kept. 
What kind of robe do I say can be kept? If by the keeping $of a [certain] robe wholesome states increase and evil and unwholesome $states decrease, then I say that kind of robe can be kept. 
$As with robes, in the same way it is also with food and drink, beds and $bedding, and villages and towns. 
$I say [further] that one cannot associate with every person, [but] I also $say that one can associate with every person. 
What kind of person do I $say cannot be associated with? If through association with a person evil $and unwholesome states increase and wholesome states decrease, then I $say that kind of person should not be associated with. 
What kind of person $do I say can be associated with? If through association with a person $wholesome states increase and evil and unwholesome states decrease, $then I say that kind of person can be associated with.307$[Thus] one knows the qualities to be cultivated as they really are, and $one knows the qualities not to be cultivated as they really are. 
Knowing $the qualities to be cultivated and the qualities not to be cultivated as they $really are, one does not cultivate the qualities that are not to be cultivated $and one cultivates the qualities that are to be cultivated. 
When one does $not cultivate the qualities that are not to be cultivated,308 and cultivates the $qualities that are to be cultivated, wholesome qualities increase and evil $and unwholesome qualities decrease. 
This is how a monk skillfully examines $303^taisho598c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$his own mind, skillfully knows his own mind, skillfully takes up [some $qualities] and skillfully gives up [other qualities].

^ck The [Second] Discourse on $Examining One’s Own Mind309$Thus have I heard. 
At one time, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $If a monk is not able to skillfully examine the minds of others, then he $should skillfully examine his own mind; in this way he should train himself. 
$How does a monk skillfully examine his own mind?310$A monk will certainly ensure much benefit for himself if he contem￾plates thus: “Do I often abide with covetousness, or do I often abide $without covetousness? Do I often abide with hatred in the mind, or do I $often abide without hatred in the mind? Do I often abide overcome by $sloth-and-torpor, or do I often abide not overcome by sloth-and-torpor? $Do I often abide with agitation and conceit, or do I often abide without $agitation and conceit? Do I often abide with doubt, or do I often abide $without doubt? Do I often abide being disputatious, or do I often abide $not being disputatious? Do I often abide with a defiled mind, or do I often $abide without a defiled mind? Do I often abide with faith or do I often $abide without faith? Do I often abide with energy, or do I often abide with $laziness? Do I often abide with mindfulness, or do I often abide without $mindfulness? Do I often abide with concentration, or do I often abide $without concentration? Do I often abide with faulty wisdom, or do I often $abide without faulty wisdom?”311$If, when examining himself, a monk knows: “I often abide with covetous￾ness ...
with hatred in the mind ...
overcome by sloth-and-torpor ...
with $agitation and conceit ...
with doubt ...
being disputatious ...
with a defiled $mind ...
without faith ...
with laziness ...
without mindfulness ...
without $concentration ...
I often abide with faulty wisdom,” then that monk, want￾ing to eradicate these evil, unwholesome states, should strive quickly by $304^taisho599a Division 10$every means, training with utmost diligence, relentlessly, with right mind￾fulness and right comprehension. 
$It is just as a person whose head is on fire or whose clothes are on fire $quickly seeks means to save his head and save his clothes. 
In the same $way, a monk who wants to eradicate these evil and unwholesome states $should strive quickly by every means, training with utmost diligence, $relentlessly, with right mindfulness and right comprehension. 
$If, when examining himself, a monk knows: “I often abide without cov￾etousness ...
without hatred in the mind ...
not overcome by sloth-and￾torpor ...
without agitation and conceit ...
without doubt ...
not being $disputatious ...
without a defiled mind ...
with faith ...
with energy ...
$with mindfulness ...
with concentration ...
I often abide without faulty $wisdom,” then that monk, established in these wholesome states, should $strive to realize the higher knowledge of the destruction of the taints.312$Why do I say of robes that not every one of them can be kept but also $say of robes that every one of them can be kept? What kind of robe do I $say cannot be kept? If by keeping a [certain] robe evil and unwholesome $states increase and wholesome states decrease, then I say that kind of robe $cannot be kept. 
What kind of robe do I say can be kept? If by keeping a $[certain] robe wholesome states increase and evil and unwholesome states $decrease, then I say that kind of robe can be kept. 
$As with robes, in the same way it is also with food and drink, beds and $bedding, villages and towns. 
$I say [further] that one cannot associate with every person, but I also $say that one can associate with every person. 
What kind of person do I say $cannot be associated with? If, through association with a [certain] person, $evil and unwholesome states increase and wholesome states decrease, then $I say that kind of person cannot be associated with. 
What kind of person $do I say can be associated with? If, through association with a [certain] $person, wholesome states increase and evil and unwholesome states $decrease, then I say that kind of person can be associated with. 
$[Thus] one knows as they really are the qualities to be cultivated, and $also knows as they really are the qualities not to be cultivated. 
Knowing $as they really are the qualities to be cultivated and the qualities not to be $cultivated, one does not cultivate the qualities that should not be cultivated $305^taisho599b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$but cultivates the qualities that should be cultivated. 
When one does not $cultivate the qualities that should not be cultivated and cultivates the qual￾ities that should be cultivated, wholesome qualities increase and evil and $unwholesome qualities decrease. 
This is how a monk skillfully examines $his own mind, skillfully knows his own mind, skillfully takes up [some $qualities] and skillfully gives up [other qualities]. 
$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks $were delighted and received it respectfully.

^ck The Discourse on $Fulfilling the Holy Life313$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying among the Kurus, $in the Kuru city of Kammāsadhamma.

Listen closely and pay proper $attention! $Then the monks listened to receive the teaching. 
$The World-honored One said: $You should know the taints, know the cause for the arising of the taints, $know the result of the taints, know the diversity of the taints, know the $cessation of the taints, and know the path to the cessation of the taints.314$You should know feelings, know the cause for the arising of feelings, $know the result of feelings, know the diversity of feelings, know the ces￾sation of feelings, and know the path to the cessation of feelings.

^ck The Discourse Spoken $at Anupiya322$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying among the Vajjīs in $the Vajjī village of Anupiya. 
$At that time the World-honored One rose from his meditation seat in the $late afternoon, came down from the hall, and said, “Ānanda, come with me $to the Aciravatī River to bathe.” Venerable Ānanda replied, “Yes.” $Thereupon, the World-honored One, followed by Venerable Ānanda, went $to the Aciravatī River. 
They took off their robes, placed them on the bank, $and entered the water to bathe. 
Having bathed, they came out again, wiped $their bodies dry, and put on their robes. 
At that time Venerable Ānanda was $holding a fan and fanning the Buddha. 
The World-honored One turned to $him and said: $Ānanda, because Devadatta is negligent, he will fall into extreme suffering. 
$He will certainly go to a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell to $stay for an entire eon, unable to find relief. 
Ānanda, have you not heard $from the [other] monks that I have definitely declared that Devadatta will $certainly go to a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell to stay for $an entire eon, unable to find relief? $Venerable Ānanda replied, “Yes, I have.” $312^taisho600c Division 10$At that time there was a certain monk who had asked Venerable Ānanda, $“Is it because the World-honored One used the knowledge of the minds of $others to discern Devadatta’s mind that he has definitely declared that Deva￾datta will certainly go to a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell to $stay for an entire eon, unable to find relief?”323 [In relation to that question,] $the World-honored One said: $Ānanda, that monk may have been young, middle-aged, or old, [but] he $was as ignorant as a youngster. 
Why is that? He had doubts because the $Tathāgata has definitely declared this. 
Ānanda, I do not see in this world, $with its devas, māras, Brahmās, renunciants, and brahmins, from human $beings to devas, [anyone else] about whom I would definitely declare $what I have declared about Devadatta. 
Why is that? $Ānanda, I have declared that Devadatta will certainly go to a bad realm $of existence and be reborn in hell to stay for an entire eon, unable to find $relief. 
Ānanda, if I saw that Devadatta had any pure state in him, amounting $even to a single hair, then I would not definitely declare that Devadatta $will certainly go to a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell to stay $for an entire eon, unable to find relief. 
[However,] Ānanda, I do not see $that Devadatta has any pure state, amounting even to a single hair, within $him. 
Therefore I have definitely declared that Devadatta will certainly go $to a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell to stay for an entire eon, $unable to find relief. 
$Ānanda, it is as if not far from a village there is a big deep cesspit, and $someone had fallen into it and sunk to the bottom. 
Suppose that someone $else comes along and is moved to much compassion, mercy, sympathy, and $concern, seeking to benefit him, seeking his security and happiness. 
That $person, having come [to the pit], walks around it looking at him and says, $“Does this man have even one spot, amounting to a single hair, that is not $contaminated by excrement, by which I could grasp him and pull him out?” $[But] having looked him over carefully he does not see that the man has $even one clean spot, amounting to a single hair, that is not contaminated $by excrement, that he could grasp with his hand and pull him out. 
$In the same way, Ānanda, if I saw that Devadatta had any pure state $in him, even amounting to a single hair, then I would not definitely declare $313^taisho601a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$that Devadatta will certainly go to a bad realm of existence and be reborn $in hell to stay for an entire eon, unable to find relief. 
[But,] Ānanda, I do $not see that Devadatta has any pure state in him, not even amounting to $a single hair. 
Therefore I have definitely declared that Devadatta will cer￾tainly go to a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell to stay for an $entire eon, unable to find relief. 
$Thereupon, Venerable Ānanda wept.324 Wiping the tears away with his $hands, he said: $It is marvelous, World-honored One, it is extraordinary that the World￾honored One has definitely declared that Devadatta will certainly go to a $bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell, to stay for an entire eon, $unable to find relief. 
$The World-honored One said: $Indeed, Ānanda. 
Indeed, Ānanda, I have declared that Devadatta will cer￾tainly go to a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell to stay for an $entire eon, unable to find relief. 
Ānanda, if you hear from the Tathāgata $the explanation of the “great knowledge of discerning people’s faculties,” $then you will certainly gain supreme faith in the Tathāgata and your heart $will be delighted. 
$At this, Venerable Ānanda extended his hands with palms together toward $the Buddha and said: $World-honored One, now is the right time. 
Well-gone One, now is the $right time. 
May the World-honored One explain to the monks the great $knowledge of discerning people’s faculties. 
The monks, on hearing it from $the World-honored One, will remember it well. 
$The World-honored One said, “Ānanda, listen closely and pay proper $attention. 
I will now explain to you the great knowledge of discerning people’s $faculties.” Venerable Ānanda listened to receive the instruction. 
$The World-honored One said: $Ānanda, the Tathāgata uses the knowledge of the minds of others to observe $another person’s mind, and knows that this person has accomplished $314$Division 10$wholesome qualities and accomplished unwholesome qualities. 
Later $the Tathāgata again uses the knowledge of the minds of others to observe $this person’s mind and knows that this person’s wholesome qualities $have ceased and unwholesome qualities have arisen. 
[Although] this per￾son’s wholesome qualities have ceased and unwholesome qualities have $arisen, a remainder of wholesome roots has not been cut off, and from $these wholesome roots the wholesome will grow back again. 
In this way $this person gains in pure qualities. 
$Ānanda, it is just as when the morning sun first appears, the darkness $ceases and light arises. 
What do you think, Ānanda: when the sun rises $higher and mealtime arrives [at midday], has not the darkness already $ceased and the light arisen?325$Venerable Ānanda replied, “It is like this, World-honored One.” $[The World-honored One said:] $In the same way, Ānanda, the Tathāgata uses the knowledge of the minds $of others to observe another person’s mind, and knows that this person $has accomplished wholesome qualities and accomplished unwholesome $qualities.

In this way, this person gains in pure qualities. 
$Ānanda, it is like seeds of grain, unspoiled and undamaged, not rotten $or broken, unharmed by wind and heat, which were stored safely in autumn. 
$If a householder tends the seeds well in a fertile field and they are watered $by timely rain, what do you think, Ānanda: will those seeds grow and thrive? $Venerable Ānanda replied, “They will, World-honored One.” $[The World-honored One said:] $In the same way, Ānanda, the Tathāgata uses the knowledge of the minds $of others to observe another person’s mind, and knows that this person $has accomplished wholesome qualities and accomplished unwholesome $315^taisho601b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$qualities.

Ānanda, this $is what is called the Tathāgata’s great knowledge of people’s faculties. 
$This is how the Tathāgata correctly knows the roots of all qualities.

What do you think, Ānanda, once $the sun has set, will not the light [totally] cease and [total] darkness descend? $Venerable Ānanda replied, “It will be so, World-honored One.” $[The World-honored One said:] $In the same way, Ānanda, the Tathāgata uses the knowledge of the minds $of others to observe another person’s mind, and knows that this person $has accomplished wholesome qualities and accomplished unwholesome $qualities.

What a teacher should do for his disciples out of great compas￾sion, mercy, sympathy, and concern, seeking their benefit and welfare, $seeking their safety and well-being—that I have now done. 
All of you $should do your part.

Do not be negligent. 
Make diligent efforts, lest you regret it $later.

^ck The Discourse on the $Root of all Phenomena329$Thus have I heard. 
At one time, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $If heterodox practitioners ask you, “What is the root of all phenomena?”, $you should answer them in this way, “All phenomena have desire as $their root.” $If they ask further, “What connects all phenomena?”, you should answer $in this way, “Contact connects all phenomena.” $If they ask further, “From what do they come?”, you should answer in $this way, “They come from feelings.” $If they ask further, “Because of what do they exist?”, you should answer $in this way, “They exist because of intentions and perceptions.” $If they ask further, “What is their leader?”, you should answer in this $way, “Mindfulness is their leader.” $If they ask further, “What is foremost among them?”, you should answer $in this way, “Concentration is foremost among them.” $If they ask further, “What is supreme among them?”, you should answer $in this way, “Wisdom is supreme among them.” $If they ask further: “What is their true [essence]?” you should answer $in this way: “Liberation is their true [essence].” $321^taisho602c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$If they ask further, “What is their culmination?”, you should answer $in this way, “Nirvana is their culmination.” $Thus, monks, desire is the root of all phenomena, contact connects $them, they come from feelings, they exist because of intentions and per￾ceptions, mindfulness is their leader, concentration is foremost among $them, wisdom is supreme among them, liberation is their true [essence], $and nirvana is their culmination. 
$Therefore, monks, you should train in this way:330 practice the mental $attitude of [one who has] gone forth to train in the path, practice the perception $of impermanence, practice the perception of dukkha in impermanence, $practice the perception of not-self in dukkha, practice the perception of impu￾rity, practice the perception of the repulsiveness of food, practice the perception $of not delighting in the entire world, practice the perception of death. 
$Knowing likes and dislikes in regard to the world, practice perceiving $them like this in the mind. 
Knowing the arising and existence of the world, $practice perceiving it like this in the mind. 
Knowing, as it really is, the $world’s arising and ceasing, its attraction, its peril, and the escape from $it, practice perceiving it like this in the mind. 
$If a monk is able to practice the mental attitude of [one who has] gone $forth to train in the path, then he is able to practice the perception of $impermanence, to practice the perception of dukkha in impermanence, $to practice the perception of not-self in dukkha, to practice the perception $of impurity, to practice the perception of the repulsiveness of food, to $practice the perception of not delighting in the entire world, and to practice $the perception of death. 
$Knowing likes and dislikes in regard to the world, he is able to practice $perceiving them like this in the mind; knowing the arising and existence $of the world, he is able to practice perceiving it like this in the mind. 
If, $knowing as it really is, the world’s arising, its ceasing, its attraction, its $peril, and the escape from it, he is able to practice perceiving it like this $in the mind, then such a monk is said to have abandoned craving and $removed the fetters. 
Having rightly known and rightly contemplated all $phenomena, he has attained the end of dukkha.$Thus spoke the Buddha.

^ck The Discourse on $Uddaka [Rāmaputta]331$Thus have I heard. 
At one time, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $In assemblies Uddaka Rāmaputta often spoke like this, “In this lifetime $I have contemplated this and realized this. 
Not knowing the root of the $tumor, I have subsequently come to know fully the root of the tumor.”332$Uddaka Rāmaputta was not omniscient yet he claimed to be omnis￾cient;333 he had not actually realized but claimed to have realized. 
$Uddaka Rāmaputta had this view and taught like this, “Existence is an $illness, a tumor, a thorn. 
Those who advocate nonperception are foolish. 
$Those who have realized [know]: this is tranquil, this is sublime, namely $attaining the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception.” $He delighted in his own identity and clung to his own identity. 
Attached $to his own identity, he practiced attaining the sphere of neither-percep￾tion-nor-nonperception. 
On the breaking up of the body at death, he was $reborn among the devas of neither-perception-nor-nonperception. 
When $his life span there is exhausted he will return to this world and be reborn $as a lowly person.334$As to this, a monk [in my dispensation] might rightly say, “In this life￾time I have contemplated this and realized this. 
Not knowing the root of $the tumor, I have subsequently come to know fully the root of the tumor.” $For a monk, what is right contemplation? A monk knows the six bases $of contact, knows their arising, knows their passing away, knows their attrac￾tion, knows their peril, and knows the escape from them. 
He knows [this] $with wisdom, as it really is. 
For a monk this is called right contemplation. 
$For a monk, what is realization? A monk knows the three [types of] $feeling, knows their arising, knows their passing away, knows their attrac￾tion, knows their peril, and knows the escape from them. 
He knows this $with wisdom, as it really is. 
For a monk, this is called right realization.335$For a monk, what is not knowing the root of the tumor but subsequently $coming to know fully the root of the tumor? A monk knows that craving $can be brought to cessation and pulls it out by its roots completely, so that $323$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$it does not arise again. 
For a monk, this is called not knowing the root of $the tumor but subsequently coming to know fully the root of the tumor. 
$As to the tumor, this is the body, with its coarse form made of the four $elements, born of father and mother, to be nourished by food and drink, $to be covered by clothing and blankets, to be massaged and bathed, having $to endure being mishandled—it is impermanent by nature, of a nature to $deteriorate and fall apart. 
This is called the tumor. 
$As to the root of the tumor, this is the threefold craving.336 Craving for $sensual pleasures, craving for form, and craving for the formless: these $are called the root of the tumor. 
$As to the taints of the tumor, these are the six bases of sense contact. 
$The taint [related to] the eye on seeing forms, the taint [related to] the ear $on hearing sounds, the taint [related to] the nose on smelling odors, the $taint [related to] the tongue on tasting flavors, the taint [related to] the $body on experiencing tangibles, the taint [related to] the mind on knowing $mental objects: these are called the taints of the tumor. 
$Monks, I have taught you about the tumor, and about the root of the $tumor.337 What a teacher should do for his disciples out of great compassion, $mercy, sympathy, and concern, seeking their benefit and welfare, seeking $their safety and well-being, that I have now done. 
You too should do your $part.

At one time the Buddha was staying among the Sakyans $at Kapilavatthu. 
$Then the World-honored One, at dawn, when the night was over, having $put on his robes and taken his bowl, went into Kapilavatthu to beg for almsfood. 
$After having partaken of the midday meal, he put away his robe and bowl $324^taisho603b Division 10$and washed his hands and feet. 
With his sitting mat over his shoulder he went $to a Sakyan shrine in a bamboo grove. 
Entering the great forest, he spread $his mat under a tree and sat down cross-legged. 
$Then the Sakyan Daṇḍapāṇi, leaning on a staff, came by on his afternoon $walk. 
He approached the Buddha and they exchanged greetings. 
Leaning on $his staff, he stood before the Buddha and asked the World-honored One, “Renun￾ciant Gotama, what is the basis of your dispensation? What do you teach?” $The World-honored One answered: $Sakyan, [my teaching] is not to quarrel with anyone in the entire world—$devas, māras, Brahmās, renunciants, and brahmins, from human beings $to devas—to practice the pure holy life secluded from sensual desires,339$abandon hypocrisy, cut off worries, and not be attached to existence, $nonexistence, or nonperception. 
This is the basis of my dispensation, this $is what I teach. 
$When the Sakyan Daṇḍapāṇi heard what the Buddha said, he neither $agreed nor disagreed. 
Shaking his head, the Sakyan Daṇḍapāṇi left. 
$Not long after the Sakyan Daṇḍapāṇi had left, in the late afternoon, the $World-honored One rose from sitting in meditation and went to the assembly $hall. 
He sat on a seat prepared in front of the sangha of monks and addressed $the monks: $This morning I put on my robes and took my bowl and went into Kapila -$vatthu to beg for almsfood. 
Having partaken of the midday meal, I put $away my robes and bowl and washed my hands and feet.

Shaking his head, the Sakyan Daṇḍapāṇi left. 
$Then one of the monks rose from his seat, arranged his robe to bare one $shoulder, extended his hands with palms together toward the Buddha, and said: $World-honored One, what is meant by “not to quarrel with anyone in the $entire world—devas, māras, Brahmās, renunciants, and brahmins, from $human beings to devas—to practice the pure holy life secluded from sen￾sual desires, abandon hypocrisy, cut off worries, and not be attached to $existence, nonexistence, or nonperception”? $The World-honored One said: $Monk, suppose that a person, with a [corresponding] reflection as the cause, $leaves the household life to train in the path. 
With intention and perception $he practices not desiring past, future, and present phenomena, not rejoicing $in them, not becoming attached to them, and not dwelling on them.340$This is called the end of dukkha, [namely, the end of] the underlying $tendency to desire, the underlying tendency to hatred, the underlying ten￾dency to existence, the underlying tendency to conceit, the underlying $tendency to ignorance, the underlying tendency to views, and the under￾lying tendency to doubt. 
[This is called the end of] quarrel, resentment, $flattery, deceit, false speech, divisive speech, and innumerable evil and $unwholesome states—this is called the end of dukkha.$Having said this, the Buddha rose from his seat and went into his dwelling $to sit in meditation. 
Then the monks thought: $Venerable friends, you should know that the World-honored One has risen $from his seat and entered his dwelling to sit in meditation, having spoken $about this matter in brief, without explaining its details, [namely,] “Suppose $that a person, with a [corresponding] reflection as the cause, leaves the $household life to train in the path.

He sees a great tree possessing roots, $branches, joints, twigs, leaves, flowers, and heartwood.

$Venerable friends, what you have said is just like that.

Why is that? Venerable friends, you should know that the World-hon￾ored One is the eye, is knowledge, is meaning, is the Dharma, is the master $of the Dharma, is the general of the Dharma.

because of the mind, because of mental objects, because of mind $consciousness, the existence of contact and the manifestation of contact $are certainly possible. 
If contact manifests, the existence of feeling and $the manifestation of feeling are certainly possible. 
If feeling manifests, $the existence and manifestation of thought, intention, and perception of $a practitioner, gone forth and training in the path, are certainly possible. 
$Venerable friends, the World-honored One rose from his seat and $entered his dwelling to sit in meditation, having spoken on this matter in $brief without explaining the details, [thus:] “Monks, suppose that a person, $with a [corresponding] reflection as the cause, leaves the household life $to train in the path. 
With intention and perception he practices not desiring $330^taisho604c Division 10$past, future, and present phenomena, not rejoicing in them, not becoming $attached to them, and not dwelling on them. 
$“This is called the end of dukkha, [namely, the end of] the underlying $tendency to desire, the underlying tendency to hatred, the underlying ten￾dency to existence, the underlying tendency to conceit, the underlying $tendency to ignorance, the underlying tendency to views, and the under￾lying tendency to doubt. 
[This is called the end of] quarrel, resentment, $flattery, deceit, false speech, divisive speech, and countless evil and $unwholesome states—this is called the end of dukkha.” $What the World-honored One spoke of only in brief without explaining $the details, I have explained in detail in this way, employing these phrases $and words. 
Venerable friends, approach the Buddha and set out [my expla￾nation] in full [to him]. 
As the World-honored One explains its meaning, $venerable friends, you should remember it! $Then, having heard what Venerable Mahākaccāna had said, bearing well $in mind [how] to recite it, the monks rose from their seats, circumambulated $Venerable Mahākaccāna three times, and left. 
They approached the Buddha. 
$Having paid homage to him, they stepped back, sat to one side, and said: $World-honored One, the instruction that the World-honored One gave in $brief without explaining its meaning in detail, after which he rose from $his seat and entered his dwelling to sit in meditation—Venerable Mahākac￾cāna has explained it to us in detail employing these phrases and words. 
$Having heard this, the World-honored One expressed praise: $It is well, it is well! My disciple is endowed with the eye, with knowledge, $with Dharma, with meaning. 
Why is that? [Because] in regard to this $matter which the teacher taught to his disciples in brief, without explaining $its details, that disciple has taught it in detail employing these phrases and $words. 
You should remember it like this, [just] as the monk Mahākaccāna $has taught it. 
Why is that? According to this explanation, so you should $contemplate the meaning. 
$Monks, it is as if someone, due to dwelling in a secluded place, in the $mountains or a forest, were to suddenly obtain a ball of honey. 
Whichever $part of it he eats, he gets the taste of it. 
In the same way, a clansman in $331$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$my true Dharma and discipline, whichever part of it he contemplates, he $gets the taste of it: Contemplating the eyes he gets the taste, contemplating $the ears ...
nose ...
tongue ...
body… contemplating the mind he gets $the taste.343$At that time Venerable Ānanda was fanning the Buddha. 
Then Venerable $Ānanda extended his hands with palms together toward the Buddha and said, $“World-honored One, what is the name of this teaching? How should we $remember it?” $The World-honored One said, “Ānanda, the name of this teaching is ‘the $simile of the honeyball.’ Thus you should remember it.” $Then the World-honored One told the monks: $Having received this teaching with the simile of the honeyball, you should $learn it and recite it. 
Why is that? Monks, the teaching with the simile of the $honeyball is meaningful. 
It is the root of the holy life. 
It leads toward the $path,344 toward awakening, toward nirvana. 
If clansmen shave off their hair $and beards, don the yellow robe, leave home out of faith, and go forth to $practice the path, they should remember well this simile of the honeyball. 
$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, Venerable $Ānanda and the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.

^ck The Discourse $Spoken to Gotamī345$Thus have I heard. 
At one time, the Buddha was staying among the Sakyans $at Kapilavatthu in the Nigrodhārāma, where he spent the rains retreat with $a large number of monks. 
$At that time Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī went to the Buddha, paid homage at $the Buddha’s feet, stood back to one side, and said: $World-honored One, are women able to attain the fourth fruit of a renun￾ciant? Will women therefore be allowed to leave home out of faith and $go forth to practice the path in this true Dharma and discipline?346$The World-honored One told her: $Desist! Desist, Gotamī! Do not think this: “Women will be allowed to $332^taisho605a Division 10$leave home out of faith and go forth to practice the path in this true Dharma $and discipline.” Gotamī, shave off your hair like this, wear the yellow $robe, and for the rest of your life practice the holy life in purity. 
$At this, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, having been refused by the Buddha, paid $homage at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and left. 
$At that time the monks were mending the Buddha’s robes, [thinking,] $“The World-honored One will soon end his rains retreat among the Sakyans. 
$The robes are mended and the three months have passed. 
[Soon] he will $collect his robes, take his bowl, and wander among the people.” $Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī heard that the monks were mending the Buddha’s $robes [thinking,] “The World-honored One will soon end his rains retreat $among the Sakyans. 
The robes are mended and the three months have passed. 
$[Soon] he will collect his robes, take his bowl, and wander among the people.” $Having heard this, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī went to the Buddha, paid homage $at the Buddha’s feet, stood back to one side, and said: $World-honored One, are women able to attain the fourth fruit of a renun￾ciant? Will women therefore be allowed to leave home out of faith and $go forth to practice the path in this true Dharma and discipline? $The World-honored One again told her: $Desist! Desist, Gotamī! Do not think this: “Women will be allowed to $leave home out of faith and go forth to practice the path in this true Dharma $and discipline.” Gotamī, shave off your hair like this, wear the yellow $robe, and for the rest of your life practice the holy life in purity. 
$At this Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, having again been refused by the Buddha, $paid homage at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and left. 
$Then the World-honored One concluded his rains retreat among the Sakyans. 
$The robes had been mended and the three months had passed. 
He gathered $up his robes, took his bowl, and went journeying among the people. 
$Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, accompanied by some elder women of the Sakyan $clan, followed in pursuit of the Buddha, who traveled in stages until he arrived $at Nādika and stayed in the Giñjakāvasatha Hall.347$At that time Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī went to the Buddha, paid homage at $the Buddha’s feet, stood back to one side and said: $333^taisho605b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$World-honored One, are women able to attain the fourth fruit of a renun￾ciant? Will women therefore be allowed to leave home out of faith and $go forth to practice the path in this true Dharma and discipline? $A third time the World-honored One told her: $Desist! Desist, Gotamī! Do not think this: “Women will be allowed to $leave home out of faith and go forth to practice the path in this true Dharma $and discipline.” Gotamī, shave off your hair like this, wear the yellow $robe, and for the rest of your life practice the holy life in purity. 
$Thereupon Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, having been refused by the Buddha for $a third time, paid homage at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three $times, and left. 
$Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī stood outside the entrance crying in great sor￾row, all covered in dirt, her bare feet muddied and soiled [from the journey]. 
$Venerable Ānanda, on seeing Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī standing outside crying $in great sorrow, all covered in dirt, her bare feet muddied and soiled, asked, $“Gotamī, why are you standing outside the entrance crying in great sorrow, $all covered in dirt, your bare feet muddied and soiled?” $Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī answered, “Venerable Ānanda, [it is because] women $are not allowed to leave home out of faith and go forth to practice the path $in this true Dharma and discipline.” $Venerable Ānanda said, “Gotamī, wait here. 
I will go to the Buddha to $speak to him about this matter.” $Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said, “Yes indeed, Venerable Ānanda.” $Thereupon, Venerable Ānanda went to the Buddha [and] paid homage $with his head at the Buddha’s feet. 
He extended his hands with palms together $toward the Buddha and said: $World-honored One, are women able to attain the fourth fruit of a renun￾ciant? Will women therefore be allowed to leave home out of faith and $go forth to practice the path in this true Dharma and discipline? $The World-honored One told him: $Desist! Desist, Ānanda! Do not think this: “Women will be allowed to $leave home out of faith and go forth to practice the path in this true Dharma $334^taisho605c Division 10$and discipline.” Ānanda, if women are allowed to leave home out of faith $and go forth to practice the path in this true Dharma and discipline, the $holy life will not last long. 
Ānanda, it is just as in a family with many $females and few males: will this family prosper? $Venerable Ānanda said, “No, World-honored One.” $[The World-honored One said:] $In the same way, Ānanda, if women are allowed to leave home out of $faith and go forth to practice the path in this true Dharma and discipline, $the holy life will not last long. 
$Ānanda, it is just as in rice fields and wheat fields: if weeds grow, the $fields will be ruined. 
In the same way, Ānanda, if women are allowed to $leave home out of faith and go forth to practice the path in this true Dharma $and discipline, the holy life will not last long.348$Venerable Ānanda said further: $World-honored One, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī has greatly benefited the World￾honored One. 
Why is that? After the World-honored One’s mother died, $Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī raised the World-honored One.349$The World-honored One said: $It is like this, Ānanda, it is like this, Ānanda. 
Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī greatly $benefited me; she raised me after my mother died. 
But, Ānanda, I have $also greatly benefited Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī. 
Why is that? $Ānanda, because of me Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī took refuge in the $Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, has no doubts about these three things $worthy of respect, and [has no doubts about the four truths of] dukkha,$its arising, its ending, and the path. 
She is accomplished in faith, upholds $the precepts, has wide knowledge, is accomplished in giving, and has $attained wisdom. 
She refrains from killing, having abandoned killing. 
She $refrains from taking what is not given, having abandoned taking what is $not given. 
She refrains from sexual misconduct, having abandoned sexual $misconduct. 
She refrains from false speech, having abandoned false speech. 
$She refrains from intoxicants, having abandoned intoxicants. 
$335$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Ānanda, if because of another person, someone takes refuge in the $Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, has no doubts about these three things $worthy of respect, and [has no doubts about the four truths of] dukkha,$its arising, its ending, and the way to it, is accomplished in faith, upholds $the precepts, has wide knowledge, is accomplished in giving, and has $attained wisdom; [if that person] refrains from killing, having abandoned $killing; refrains from taking what is not given, having abandoned taking $what is not given; refrains from sexual misconduct, having abandoned $sexual misconduct; refrains from false speech, having abandoned false $speech; refrains from intoxicants, having abandoned intoxicants—then, $Ānanda, even if one were to make offerings to that person with clothes $and blankets, food and drink, beds and bedding, and medicine, all the req￾uisites of life, for the rest of one’s life, one could not repay this favor. 
$Ānanda, for women I will now lay down eight rules of respect, which $women may not transgress but must uphold until the end of their lives. 
$Ānanda, just as a fisherman or his apprentice may build a dike in deep $water to keep the water in and not let it flow out, in the same way, Ānanda, $I now lay down eight rules of respect, which women may not transgress $but must uphold until the end of their lives. 
What are these eight? $Ānanda, a nun should seek full ordination from the monks. 
Ānanda, $this is the first rule of respect that I lay down for women, which women $may not transgress but must uphold until the end of their lives.350$Ānanda, a nun should seek instruction every half-month from the monks. 
$Ānanda, this is the second rule of respect that I lay down for women, which $women may not transgress but must uphold until the end of their lives. 
$Ānanda, a nun is not allowed to spend the rains retreat in an area where $there are no monks. 
Ānanda, this is the third rule of respect that I lay down $for women, which women may not transgress but must uphold until the $end of their lives. 
$Ānanda, when a nun has completed the rains retreat, she should ask $in both assemblies about three things: seeking about what has been seen, $what has been heard, and what has been suspected. 
Ānanda, this is the $fourth rule of respect that I lay down for women, which women may not $transgress but must uphold until the end of their lives. 
$336^taisho606a Division 10$Ānanda, if a monk has not given a nun permission to ask about the dis￾courses, the discipline, or the Abhidharma, then that nun is not allowed $to ask him about them. 
[Only] if he gives her permission to ask about the $discourses, the discipline, or the Abhidharma is she allowed to ask. 
Ānanda, $this is the fifth rule of respect that I lay down for women, which women $may not transgress but must uphold until the end of their lives.351$Ānanda, a nun is not allowed to point out the transgressions of a monk $but a monk is allowed to point out the transgressions of a nun. 
Ānanda, $this is the sixth rule of respect that I lay down for women, which women $may not transgress but must uphold until the end of their lives. 
$Ānanda, if a nun commits a serious offense (saṅghādisesa), she is to $undergo penance before both assemblies for fifteen days. 
Ānanda, this is $the seventh rule of respect that I lay down for women, which women may $not transgress but must uphold until the end of their lives. 
$Ānanda, even if a nun has received full ordination for a hundred years $she must still prostrate herself humbly before a recently ordained monk, $be respectful and submissive, and greet him by extending her hands with $palms together. 
Ānanda, this is the eighth rule of respect that I lay down $for women, which women may not transgress but must uphold until the $end of their lives. 
$Ānanda, I lay down for women these eight rules of respect, which $women may not transgress but must uphold until the end of their lives. 
$Ānanda, if Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī upholds these eight rules of respect, then $this is her leaving home out of faith, going forth to practice the path in this $true Dharma and discipline, obtaining full ordination, and becoming a nun. 
$Thereupon Venerable Ānanda, having heard what the Buddha said, $received it well, retained it well, paid homage at the Buddha’s feet, cir￾cumambulated him three times, and left. 
He went to Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī $and told her: $Gotamī, women are allowed to leave home out of faith and go forth to $practice the path in this true Dharma and discipline. 
Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, $the World-honored One has laid down for women eight rules of respect, $which women may not transgress but must uphold until the end of their $lives.

$338^taisho606c Division 10$Gotamī, even if a nun has had full ordination for a hundred years she $must still prostrate herself humbly before a recently ordained monk, be $respectful and submissive, and greet him, extending her hands with palms $together.

$Gotamī, the World-honored One has laid down for women these eight $rules of respect, which women may not transgress but must uphold until $the end of their lives. 
Gotamī, the World-honored One has said this: “If $Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī upholds these eight rules of respect, then this is her $leaving home out of faith and going forth to practice the path in this true $Dharma and discipline, obtaining full ordination, and becoming a nun.” $At this Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said: $Venerable Ānanda, listen while I tell you a simile. 
The wise, on hearing $a simile, understand its implication. 
$Venerable Ānanda, it is just as [when] a warrior woman, a brahmin $woman, a householder woman, or a worker woman, beautiful and attrac￾tive, having cleansed and bathed herself and anointed her body with fra￾grant oils, may put on bright clean clothes, and adorn herself with necklaces $made of various kinds of precious stones. 
Suppose someone, feeling well￾disposed toward this woman and wishing to benefit her and make her $happy, then gives her a wreath of lotuses, a wreath of champak flowers, $a wreath of great-flowered jasmine (sumanā), a wreath of Arabian jasmine $(vassikā), or a wreath of roses. 
That woman would rejoice and accept it $with both hands and adorn her head with it. 
$In the same way, Venerable Ānanda, the World-honored One has laid $down for women these eight rules of respect and I receive them on my $head and will uphold them until the end of my life. 
$Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī went forth to practice the path in this true $Dharma and discipline, obtained full ordination, and became a nun.352$At a later time, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī came to be followed and surrounded $by a large assembly of nuns. 
Accompanied by various elder and highly $339$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$regarded nuns who were known to the king, and who had practiced the holy $life for a long time, she approached Venerable Ānanda. 
$Having paid homage to him and stood back to one side, she said: $Venerable Ānanda should know that these are elder and highly regarded $nuns, who are known to kings, and who have practiced the holy life for $a long time. 
There are young monks, new in the training, who have only $recently gone forth and entered this true Dharma and discipline, who have $begun [this practice] not long ago. 
We wish that those monks should be $ordered to pay homage to these nuns according to their seniority, that they $should show respect and reverence and greet them by extending their $hands with palms together. 
$At this Venerable Ānanda said, “Gotamī, wait here. 
I will go to the Buddha $and ask him about this.” $Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said, “Certainly, Venerable Ānanda.” $Then Venerable Ānanda went to the Buddha, paid homage at the Buddha’s $feet and stood back to one side. 
Extending his hands with palms together, $he addressed the Buddha: $World-honored One, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, accompanied by various elder $and highly regarded nuns who are known to kings and who have practiced $the holy life for a long time, came to me today. 
Having paid homage at $my feet and stood to one side with palms together, she said to me, “Ven￾erable Ānanda, these elder and highly regarded nuns are known to kings $and have practiced the holy life for a long time. 
There are young monks, $new in the training, who have only recently gone forth and entered this $true teaching and discipline, who have begun [this practice] not long ago. 
$We wish that those monks should be ordered to pay homage to these nuns $according to their seniority, that they should show respect and reverence $and greet them by extending their hands with palms together.” $The World-honored One said: $Desist! Desist, Ānanda! Guard your words, do not speak like this! Ānanda, $if you knew what I know, you would not say one word [about this], let $alone speak like this. 
$340^taisho607a Division 10$Ānanda, if women had not been allowed to leave home out of faith $and go forth to practice the path in this true Dharma and discipline, then $brahmins and householders would spread their clothes on the ground and $say, “Diligent renunciants, walk on this! The diligent renunciants practice $what is difficult to practice. 
Grant us long-lasting benefit and gain, peace $and happiness [by stepping on these clothes]!” $Ānanda, if women had not been allowed to leave home out of faith $and go forth to practice the path in this true Dharma and discipline, then $brahmins and householders would spread their hair on the ground and $say, “Diligent renunciants, walk on this! The diligent renunciants practice $what is difficult to practice. 
Grant us long-lasting benefit and gain, peace $and happiness [by stepping on this hair]!” $Ānanda, if women had not been allowed to leave home out of faith $and go forth to practice the path in this true Dharma and discipline, then $brahmins and householders, on seeing renunciants, would have been wait￾ing by the wayside holding in their hands various types of food and drink, $saying, “Venerable ones, accept this, eat this, take it with you and use it $as you wish. 
Grant us long-lasting benefit and gain, peace and happiness!” $Ānanda, if women had not been allowed to leave home out of faith $and go forth to practice the path in this true Dharma and discipline, then $faithful brahmins, on seeing diligent renunciants, would respectfully take $them by the arm, lead them into their houses, and hold up various sorts $of material goods to give to the renunciants, saying, “Venerable Ones, $accept this, take it with you and use it as you wish! Grant us long-lasting $benefit and gain, peace and happiness!” $Ānanda, if women had not been allowed to leave home out of faith $and go forth to practice the path in this true Dharma and discipline, then $even the sun and moon, endowed as they are with great spiritual powers, $great virtue, great merit, great spiritual might—even they would not equal $the great spiritual might of a diligent renunciant, much less would those $lifeless, skinny heterodox practitioners. 
$Ānanda, if women had not been allowed to leave home out of faith and $go forth to practice the path in this true Dharma and discipline, then this $true Dharma would have lasted a thousand years. 
Now its duration has $been decreased by five hundred years; it will last only five hundred years. 
$341^taisho607b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Ānanda, you should know that there are five positions a woman cannot $achieve. 
It is not possible for a woman to be a tathāgata, without attachment $and fully awakened;353 a wheel-turning monarch; Sakka, the ruler of the $devas; King Māra; or Great Brahmā. 
Know that a man can achieve these $five states. 
It is possible that a man can be a tathāgata, without attachment $and fully awakened; a wheel-turning monarch; Sakka, the ruler of the $devas; King Māra; or Great Brahmā. 
$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, Venerable $Ānanda and the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.$342$Division 11 $The [First] Great $Division $117. 
^ck The Discourse on $Delicate [Upbringing]354$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $In the past, [before] I had left the household life to practice the path, I $[lived] at leisure, composed and happy, being brought up in an extremely $delicate [manner]. 
While I was [still] living in the home of my father, $Suddho dana, he built various palaces for me: a spring palace, a summer $palace, and a winter palace. 
$To provide for my recreation, he had various kinds of flower ponds $constructed not far from these palaces: flower ponds for blue lotuses, for $pink lotuses, for red lotuses, and for white lotuses. 
In those ponds he had $various water flowers planted: blue lotus, pink lotus, red lotus, and white $lotus. 
He had them constantly supplied with water and flowers; and he $had them guarded, so that no one else could gain access to them. 
$To provide for my recreation, he had various kinds of land-dwelling $flowers planted on the banks of the ponds: great-flowered jasmine, Arabian $jasmine, champak, fragrant lily, honey-scent flower, rose flower, and water $lily.355$To provide for my recreation, he assigned four people to bathe me. 
$Having bathed me, they would apply red sandalwood paste to my body. 
$Having applied sandalwood paste to my body, they would dress me in $new silk clothes, brand new from top to bottom, inside and out, surface $and interior. 
By day and by night they constantly held a parasol over me, $the Crown Prince, so that I would not be dampened by dew at night or $scorched by the sun during the day. 
$343^taisho607c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Whereas in other, ordinary households coarse grains, wheat, bean soup, $and ginger were the primary foods, within the household of my father, $Suddhodana, even the lowest-ranking servants had rice and sumptuous $dishes as their primary foods. 
$Again, meals were constantly prepared for me from game birds and $beasts, the most beautiful birds and beasts—pheasant or partridge, and deer $or roe—such game birds and beasts, the most beautiful birds and beasts. 
$I recall how, long ago, when I was [still] living in the home of my $father, Suddhodana, I would go up to the main palace to spend the four $months of the summer season. 
There were no other men there, only women $for my entertainment. 
Once there, I had no [thought of] coming down $again. 
When I wanted to visit parks, thirty renowned cavalrymen of the $best quality were selected to provide a ceremonial escort, both ahead of $me and behind me, to wait on me and guide me—not to mention my other $[servants]. 
Such was my prestige and power. 
So exceedingly delicate [was $my upbringing]. 
$I also recall how, long ago, I saw farmers resting in their fields. 
I went $to the base of a rose-apple tree and sat down cross-legged. 
Secluded from $sensual pleasures, secluded from evil and unwholesome states, I entered $and abided in the first absorption, which is with [directed] awareness and $[sustained] contemplation, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion.356$I thought, “Unlearned ignorant worldlings are themselves subject to $disease, not exempt from disease. 
On seeing other people become sick, $they feel disgust and slight them as undesirable and unpleasant, not observ￾ing their own [condition].” $Again, I thought, “I am myself subject to disease, not exempt from $disease. 
If on seeing other people become sick I were to feel disgust and $slight them as undesirable and unpleasant, then that would not be appro￾priate for me, since I too am subject to this [condition].” On my having $observed in this way, the pride caused by being without sickness naturally $vanished. 
$Again, I thought, “Unlearned ignorant worldlings are themselves subject $to old age, not exempt from old age. 
On seeing other people become old, $they feel disgust and slight them as undesirable and unpleasant, not observ￾ing their own [condition].” $344^taisho608a Division 11$Again I thought, “I am myself subject to old age, not exempt from old $age. 
If on seeing other people become old I were to feel disgust and slight $them as undesirable and unpleasant, that would not be appropriate for me, $since I too am subject to this [condition].” On my having contemplated $in this way, the pride caused by [youthful] age naturally vanished.357$Unlearned ignorant worldlings are proud, conceited, and become neg￾ligent due to being without disease. 
Due to sensual desires their ignorance $grows and they do not practice the holy life. 
Unlearned ignorant worldlings $are proud, conceited, and become negligent due to being [youthful]. 
$Because of sensual desires their ignorance grows and they do not practice $the holy life. 
Unlearned ignorant worldlings are proud, conceited, and $become negligent due to being alive. 
Due to sensual desires their ignorance $grows and they do not practice the holy life. 
$Then the World-honored One uttered these verses: $Subject to disease, subject to old age, and subject to death. 
$[Despite] being themselves similarly subject [to these], $Worldlings view [these conditions] with disgust. 
$If I were to feel disgust [at these conditions], $[Despite] not having gone beyond them, $That would not be appropriate for me, $Since I too am subject to this. 
$One who practices like this $Realizes the Dharma that [leads to] freedom from rebirth $As for pride in being without disease, $Youthful, and of long life. 
$Eliminating all [such] pride, $One sees the peace of dispassion. 
$By awakening in this way, $One is not anxious in regard to sensual pleasures. 
$Attaining the perception that there is nothing [in sensual pleasures], $He practices the pure holy life. 
$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks $were delighted and received it respectfully.

^ck The Discourse on $the Elephant358$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the $Eastern Park, in the Hall of Migāra’s Mother. 
$At that time, in the afternoon, the World-honored One rose from sitting $in seclusion, came down from the hall, and said, “Udāyin, let us go together $to the Eastern River to bathe.”359$Venerable Udāyin answered, “Yes.” $Then the World-honored One went to the Eastern River together with $Venerable Udāyin. 
He took off his robes, left them on the bank, and entered $the water to bathe. 
Having bathed, he came out, wiped his body [dry], and $put on his robes. 
$At that time King Pasenadi had an elephant (nāga) named Sati.360 It was $crossing the Eastern River to the accompaniment of all kinds of entertaining $music. 
On seeing it, the multitude said, “This is a nāga among nāgas, a great $royal nāga. 
What is its name?” $Venerable Udāyin extended his hands with palms together toward the $Buddha and said: $World-honored One, this elephant has a massive body, and the multitude, $on seeing it, say, ‘“This is a nāga among nāgas, a great royal nāga. 
What $is its name?” $The World-honored One said: $That is so, Udāyin. 
That is so, Udāyin. 
This elephant has a massive body, $and the multitude, on seeing it, say, “This is a nāga among nāgas, a great $royal nāga. 
What is its name?” $Udāyin, if a horse, a camel, an ox, a donkey, a serpent, a human being, $or a tree has grown to have a massive bodily form, then Udāyin, the mul￾titude, on seeing it, say, “This is a nāga among nāgas, a great royal nāga.$What is its name?” $Udāyin, in this world with its devas, māras, Brahmās, renunciants, $and brahmins, from human beings to devas, of anyone who does not $harm [others] through [acts of] body, speech, or mind I say, “he is a $nāga.”361 Udāyin, in this world with its devas, māras, Brahmās, renunciants, $346$Division 11$and brahmins, from human beings to devas, the Tathāgata does not harm $[others] through [acts of] body, speech, or mind. 
For this reason I am $called a nāga.$Then Venerable Udāyin extended his hands with palms together toward $the Buddha and said: $World-honored One! May the World-honored One enhance my inspira￾tional power! May the Well-gone One enhance my inspirational power! $Allow me, in the presence of the Buddha, to chant in praise of the World￾honored One with verses related to the characteristics of a nāga! $The World-honored One said, “Do as you wish.” $Then, Venerable Udāyin, in the presence of the Buddha, praised the World￾honored One with verses related to the characteristics of a nāga:$The Fully Awakened One, born among humans, $Taming himself, attained right concentration. 
$Practicing the holy path, $He calmed his mind and was able by himself to attain happiness. 
$Respected by men $For transcending all things, $He is also respected by devas $[As] one who has become an arahant, without attachment. 
$He has gone beyond all fetters, $From being in the jungle [of fetters], he has left the jungle behind $ [by attaining nirvana].362$Having discarded sensual pleasures, he delights in dispassion, $Like true gold extracted from ore. 
$Renowned as the Fully Awakened One, $Like the sun ascending in the sky, $[He is] supreme among all nāgas, $Like the highest summit among a multitude of mountains. 
$Praised as a great nāga, $He does no harm anywhere. 
$347^taisho608c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$The nāga among all nāgas, $Truly is an unsurpassable nāga.$Gentleness and harmlessness— $These two are the nāga’s [hind] legs. 
$Asceticism and celibacy $Are the nāga’s practice. 
$The great nāga has faith as his trunk, $Two kinds of virtue as his tusks; $Mindfulness as his neck, and wisdom as his head, $To contemplate and analyze the teaching; $Receiving and retaining the teachings is his belly, $Delight in seclusion is his two forelegs.363$Settled well on the in- and out-breaths, $[His] mind attains perfect concentration. 
$The nāga remains concentrated when walking and when standing still; $When seated he is concentrated and also when lying down. 
$The nāga is concentrated at all times. 
$This is the constant state of the nāga.$He accepts food from a household that is without fault. 
$He does not accept it from one that is with fault. 
$[If] he receives food that is bad or impure, $He discards it, as a lion does. 
$The food that is offered to him $He accepts out of compassion for others. 
$The nāga, in eating the faithful offerings of others, $Maintains his life without attachment. 
$He has cut off all fetters, big and small, $Attained liberation from all bonds. 
$Wherever he travels, $His mind is not bound by any attachment. 
$Just as a white lotus $348$Division 11$Is born in water and grows up nourished by water, $[Yet] the muddy water cannot become attached $To its fine fragrance and delightful form— $In the same way, the supremely Awakened One $Was born into the world and is active in the world, $[Yet] is not defiled by sensual pleasures, $Just as the [lotus] flower to which the [muddy] water does not become $ attached. 
$It is just as a blazing fire $Will cease burning if not supplied with fuel. 
$Without fuel a fire will not continue; $Such a fire is said to have ceased. 
$Wise men deliver these similes, $Wishing their meaning to be understood. 
$This is what the nāga has come to know, $And what the nāga among nāgas teaches. 
$Free from sexual desire and hatred, $Having discarded ignorance and attained the [state] without taints, $[When] the nāga abandons his body, $This nāga is said to have ceased. 
$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, Venerable $Udāyin was delighted and received it respectfully.

^ck The Discourse on the $Grounds for Speaking364$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $Herein there are [just] three grounds for speaking,365 not four and not five. 
$If a monk has seen [something], then based on that he may speak, saying, $“I saw it.” [If he has] heard ...
recognized ...
known [something, then $based on that] a monk may speak, saying, “This is what I know.” $349^taisho609a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$What are the three [grounds for speaking]? Based on the past a monk $may speak, saying, “Like this it was in the past.” Based on the future a $monk may speak, saying, “Like this it will be in the future.” Based on the $present a monk may speak, saying, “Like this it is now.” These are the $three grounds for speaking, not four and not five. 
$If a monk has seen [something], then based on that he may speak, say￾ing, “I saw it.” [If he has] heard ...
cognized ...
known [something, then $based on that] a monk may speak, saying, “This is what I know.” Since $what he says is wholesome, he gains benefit. 
Since he does not say what $is unwholesome, he gains benefit. 
$A disciple of the noble ones listens attentively with both ears to the $Dharma. 
Having listened attentively with both ears to the Dharma, he $abandons one factor, practices one factor, and realizes one factor. 
Having $abandoned one factor, practiced one factor, and realized one factor, he $attains right concentration. 
$A disciple of the noble ones, having attained right concentration of $mind, then abandons all sensual passion, hatred, and ignorance. 
In this $way a disciple of the noble ones attains liberation of the mind. 
Having $attained liberation, he knows that he is liberated. 
He knows as it really is: $“Birth has been ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be $done has been done, there will not be another experience of existence.”366$Based on what a person says, there are four grounds on which one $should observe him, [thinking,] “Is this venerable one fit to engage in dis￾cussion or not fit to engage in discussion?” If this venerable one does not $respond definitively to a definitive argument, does not respond analytically $to an analytical argument, does not respond conclusively to a conclusive $argument, and does not respond with finality to a final argument, then in $these ways this venerable one is not fit to engage in discussion, not fit to $engage in argumentation. 
$If [however] this venerable one does respond definitively to a definitive $argument, does respond analytically to an analytical argument, does $respond conclusively to a conclusive argument, and does respond with $finality to a final argument, then in these ways this venerable one is fit to $engage in discussion, fit to engage in argumentation.367$350^taisho609b Division 11$Again, based on what a person has said, there are a further four grounds $on which one should observe him, [thinking,] “Is this venerable one fit $to engage in discussion or not fit to engage in discussion?” If this venerable $one is inconsistent about standpoints and their opposites, inconsistent $about what is known, inconsistent about what has been explained through $similes, and inconsistent about procedure, then in these ways this venerable $one is not fit to engage in discussion, not fit to engage in argumentation. 
$If [however] this venerable one is consistent about standpoints and $their opposites, consistent about what is known, consistent about what $has been explained through similes, and consistent about procedure, then $in these ways this venerable one is fit to engage in discussion, fit to engage $in argumentation.368$Depending on what is being spoken of, he curbs his verbal activity at $the [proper] time. 
He discards his preformed views, discards resentful $states of mind, discards sensual desire, discards hatred, discards delusion, $discards pride, discards obstinate silence, discards stinginess and jealousy. 
$He does not pursue victory, does not prevail over others, and does not $seize on their mistakes. 
He talks only about what is meaningful, about $Dharma. 
Having talked about what is meaningful, about Dharma, and $having taught it and again taught it, he himself is delighted and causes $others to be delighted. 
Such talk about what is meaningful, such talk on $[these] subjects is noble talk about what is meaningful, noble talk about $[these] matters. 
It leads all the way to total destruction of the taints. 
$Then the World-honored One uttered these verses: $If when arguing in a discussion, $The confused mind harbors cherishing and pride, $Then this is not noble; it destroys virtue, $With each seeking advantage over the other. 
$Just seeking to find fault with the other, $Wishing to defeat him; $Striving ever more for victory over each other— $Noble ones do not speak like this. 
$351$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$If he wants to be competent in discussion, $A wise one should know the [proper] timing. 
$With Dharma and with meaning, $This is how the noble ones discuss. 
$The wise speak like this: $Without dispute, without pride, $Without feelings of aversion, $Without fetters, without taints. 
$Compliant and unconfused, $They speak with right knowledge. 
$They accept what is well said, $And they themselves never speak evil. 
$In discussion they do not remonstrate, $And are not affected by others’ remonstration. 
$They know the standpoints and grounds for their speech, $This is [the way] they discuss. 
$Thus speak the noble ones, $The wise ones who completely get the meaning. 
$For happiness in the present, $And for peace in the hereafter, $You should know that an intelligent person $Speaks without bias or banality. 
$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks $were delighted and received it respectfully.

^ck The Discourse on a $Teaching about Impermanence369$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $Form is impermanent; what is impermanent, that it is dukkha; what is $dukkha, that is not-self. 
Feeling too is impermanent; what is impermanent, $352^taisho609c Division 11$that is dukkha; what is dukkha, that is not-self. 
Perception too is imper￾manent; what is impermanent, that is dukkha; what is dukkha, that is not￾self. 
Volitional formations too are impermanent; what is impermanent, $that is dukkha; what is dukkha, that is not-self. 
Consciousness too is imper￾manent; what is impermanent, that is dukkha; what is dukkha, that is not￾self. 
That is to say: Form is impermanent ...
feeling ...
perception ...
$volitional formations ...
consciousness is impermanent; what is imper￾manent, that is dukkha; what is dukkha, that is not-self. 
$A learned noble disciple, contemplating in this way, cultivates the $thirty-seven requisites of awakening with unobstructed right attention and $right mindfulness370 Knowing like this and seeing like this, his mind is $liberated from the taint of sensual desire, from the taint of existence, and $from the taint of ignorance. 
Being liberated, he knows that he is liberated, $and he knows as it really is: “Birth has been ended for me, the holy life $has been established, what had to be done has been done; there will not $be another experiencing of existence.” $Among existing sentient beings whatsoever—including the nine abodes $of sentient beings, up to the stage beyond the sphere of neither-percep￾tion-nor-nonperception, [called] “the pinnacle of existence”—among [all $of] these this is the foremost, this is the greatest, this is the victor, this is $the utmost, this is the most admirable, this is the most excellent, namely: $an arahant in the world. 
Why is that? Because an arahant in the world has $attained [true] peace and happiness. 
$Then the World-honored One uttered these verses: $Freedom from attachment is the foremost happiness. 
$[An arahant] has abandoned sensual desires, and is without craving $ for existence. 
$He has forever discarded the “I”-conceit, $Having torn asunder the net of ignorance. 
$He has attained imperturbability, $His mind is without defilements. 
$He is not defiled by attachment to the world, $Having lived the holy life and attained freedom from taints. 
$353$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$He understands and knows the five aggregates, $His province is the seven wholesome states.371$A great hero, he dwells in a place $That is free from all fear. 
$Having attained the seven treasures of awakening, $And trained in the threefold training, $He is well reputed as a superior friend, $The Buddha’s supreme and true son. 
$He has attained the tenfold path, $A great nāga with a supremely concentrated mind. 
$Foremost in this world, $He is without craving for existence. 
$Unperturbed by the myriad affairs, $Liberated from future existence, $Having cut off birth, old age, disease, and death. 
$What was to be done is done: he has eradicated the taints. 
$He has generated the knowledge of one beyond training $Having made this body his last. 
$Equipped with the foremost holy life, $His mind is not dependent on others. 
$Above, below, and in all directions, $Nowhere does he find delight. 
$He can roar a lion’s roar, $Supremely awakened in the world. 
$Thus spoke the Buddha.

^ck The Discourse on $the Invitation Ceremony $(Pavāraṇā)372$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha, in the $Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary, spending the rains retreat together $with a large assembly of five hundred monks. 
$354^taisho610a Division 11$At that time on the fifteenth of the month, at the time of the recitation of $the code of rules, at the invitation ceremony (pavāraṇā), the World-honored $One sat down on a seat arranged before the assembly of monks. 
He addressed $the monks: $I am a brahmin, having attained complete cessation. 
[I am] the unsurpass￾able King of Physicians and this present body is the last one for me. 
Being $a brahmin, having attained complete cessation, being the unexcelled King $of Physicians, and this present body being the last one for me, I say that $you are my true sons, born from my mouth and transformed by the nature $of the Dharma. 
Being my true sons, born from my mouth and transformed $by the nature of the Dharma, you should through instruction transform $[others, and also] teach and admonish one another.373$At that time Venerable Sāriputta was also seated among the assembly. 
Then $Venerable Sāriputta rose from his seat, arranged his robe to bare one shoulder, $extended his hands with palms together toward the Buddha, and said: $Just now the World-honored One said [this]: “I am a brahmin, having $attained complete cessation. 
[I am] the unsurpassable King of Physicians, $and this present body is the last one for me. 
Being a brahmin, having $attained complete cessation, being the unsurpassable King of Physicians, $and this present body being the last one for me, I say that you are my true $sons, born from my mouth and transformed by the nature of the Dharma. 
$Being my true sons, born from my mouth and transformed by the nature $of the Dharma, you should through instruction transform [others, and $also] teach and admonish one another.” $The World-honored One tames those who are not [yet] tamed, stills $those who are not [yet] stilled, delivers those who are not [yet] delivered, $liberates those who are not [yet] liberated, quenches those who are not $[yet] quenched, brings to attainment of the path those who have not [yet] $attained the path, establishes in the holy life those who are not [yet] estab￾lished in the holy life. 
[He causes them to] know the path, awaken to the $path, recognize the path, and talk about the path. 
$From the World-honored One the disciples obtain the Dharma, receive $instruction, and receive admonition. 
Having received instruction and $admonition, following the World-honored One’s words, they then put it $355^taisho610b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$into practice and gain a good understanding of the true Dharma in accor￾dance with its purport. 
That is so. 
World-honored One, is there not some￾thing to censure in my bodily, verbal, and mental conduct? $Then the World-honored One said: $Sāriputta, I do not censure your bodily, verbal, and mental conduct. 
Why $is that? Sāriputta, you possess intelligent wisdom, great wisdom, quick $wisdom, swift wisdom, sharp wisdom, wide wisdom, deep wisdom, eman￾cipating wisdom, brightly penetrating wisdom. 
Sāriputta, you have achieved $true wisdom. 
$Sāriputta, it is just as the crown prince of a wheel-turning monarch, if $he does not overstep the instructions he has received but respectfully $accepts what his father, the king, transmits to him, he is then able to $transmit it in turn. 
In the same way, Sāriputta, you are able to keep turning $the wheel of Dharma that I have set turning. 
For this reason, Sāriputta, I $do not censure your bodily, verbal, and mental conduct. 
$Venerable Sāriputta again extended his hands with palms together toward $the Buddha and said: $That is so. 
The World-honored One does not censure my bodily, verbal, $and mental conduct. 
Does the World-honored One not censure the bodily, $verbal, and mental conduct of these five hundred monks? $The World-honored One said: $Sāriputta, I also do not censure the bodily, verbal, and mental conduct of $these five hundred monks. 
Why is that? Sāriputta, these five hundred $monks have all attained freedom from attachment. 
In them the taints have $been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be done $has been done, the heavy burden has been discarded, the fetter of existence $has been eradicated, and they have attained the good benefit of right knowl￾edge and right liberation. 
$The only exception is one monk, of whom I earlier foretold that he $would, here and now, attain final knowledge, understanding as it really $is: “Birth has been ended, the holy life has been established, what had to $be done has been done, there will not be another experience of existence.”374$356$Division 11$For this reason, Sāriputta, I do not censure the bodily, verbal, and mental $conduct of these five hundred monks. 
$A third time Venerable Sāriputta extended his hands with palms together $toward the Buddha and said: $That is so. 
The World-honored One does not censure my bodily, verbal, $and mental conduct, and he also does not censure the bodily, verbal, and $mental conduct of these five hundred monks. 
World-honored One, among $these five hundred monks, how many monks have attained the three higher $knowledges, how many monks have attained liberation both ways, and $how many monks have attained liberation by wisdom? $The World-honored One said: $Sāriputta, among these five hundred monks, ninety monks have attained $the three higher knowledges, ninety monks have attained liberation both $ways, and the remaining monks have attained liberation by wisdom. 
$Sāriputta, this assembly is without branches, without leaves, and without $knots or faults. 
It is pure and genuine [heartwood], having become rightly $established.375$At that time Venerable Vaṅgīsa was seated among the assembly. 
Then $Venerable Vaṅgīsa rose from his seat, arranged his robe to bare one shoulder, $extended his hands with palms together toward the Buddha, and said: $That is so. 
The World-honored One has uplifted me. 
May the Well-gone $One [further] uplift me, so that I may, in the presence of the Buddha and $the assembly of monks, utter suitable verses of praise. 
$The World-honored One said, “Vaṅgīsa, do as you wish!” $Then in the presence of the Buddha and the assembly of monks, Venerable $Vaṅgīsa uttered suitable verses of praise: $Today, on the fifteenth, the day of invitation, $An assembly of five hundred monks is seated together. 
$Having gotten rid of all fetters, $They are without obstructions, seers for whom [repeated] existence $ is ended. 
$357^taisho610c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Shining with pure light, $[They are] liberated from every kind of existence. 
$They have put an end to birth, old age, disease, and death, $Eliminated the taints, and done what had to be done. 
$[They] have put an end to restlessness-and-worry and the fetter of doubt, $To pride and the taint of existence, $And they have cut off the thorn that is the fetter of craving. 
$[Thanks to] the Highest Physician, these no longer exist. 
$Brave as lions, $[They] have removed all fear. 
$They have crossed over birth and death, $With all taints completely eradicated.376$Just as a wheel-turning monarch, $Surrounded by his many courtiers, $Rules over his entire territory, $As far as the great ocean, $In the same way, the heroic conqueror, $The unsurpassable caravan leader, $Is revered gladly by his disciples, $Who have realized the three [higher knowledges] and abandoned $ the fear of death. 
$All are sons of the Buddha, $Who have permanently removed the branches, leaves, and knots. 
$They pay homage to the foremost Honored One, $Who set turning the unsurpassable wheel of the Dharma.377$Thus spoke the Buddha.

^ck The Discourse $at Campā378$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Campā, beside $the pond of Gaggarā. 
$358$Division 11$At that time, on the fifteenth of the month, at the time of the recital of the $code of rules, the World-honored One sat down on a seat arranged before an $assembly of monks. 
Having sat down, the World-honored One immediately $entered a meditative concentration. 
By means of the knowledge of the minds $of others he observed the minds of the assembly. 
Having observed the minds $of the assembly, he sat silently until the end of the first watch of the night.379$Then a certain monk rose from his seat, arranged his robe to bare one shoul￾der, extended his hands with palms together toward the Buddha, and said: $World-honored One, the first watch of the night has ended. 
The Buddha $and the assembly of monks have been sitting together for a long time. 
$May the World-honored One recite the code of rules!380$At that time the World-honored One remained silent and did not answer. 
$Then the World-honored One remained sitting silently through the middle $watch of the night. 
That monk again rose from his seat, arranged his robe to $bare one shoulder, extended his hands with palms together toward the Buddha, $and said: $World-honored One, the first watch of the night has passed and the middle $watch of the night is about to end. 
The Buddha and the assembly of monks $have been sitting together for a long time. 
May the World-honored One $recite the code of rules! $The World-honored One again remained silent. 
Then the World-honored $One remained sitting silently through the last watch of the night. 
$A third time that monk rose from his seat, arranged his robe so as to bare $one shoulder, extended his hands with palms together towards the Buddha, $and said: $World-honored One, the first watch of the night has passed, the middle $watch of the night has also ended, and the last watch of the night is coming $to an end. 
It is nearly dawn. 
Dawn will be breaking before long. 
The $Buddha and the assembly of monks have been sitting together for a very $long time. 
May the World-honored One recite the code of rules! $Then the World-honored One told that monk, “Among this assembly there $is one monk who is impure.” $359^taisho611a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$At that time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was also seated among the assem￾bly. 
Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna thought, “About which monk does $the World-honored One say that one monk in this assembly is impure? Let $me enter the appropriate meditative concentration such that, through that $appropriate meditative concentration I acquire the knowledge of the minds $of others and can observe the minds of the assembly.” $Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna entered the appropriate meditative con￾centration such that through that appropriate meditative concentration he $acquired the knowledge of the minds of others and could observe the minds $of the assembly. 
Venerable Mahāmoggallāna then knew in regard to which $monk the World-honored One had said that one monk in the assembly was $impure. 
$Thereupon Venerable Mahāmoggallāna rose from his meditative concen￾tration, went up to that monk, pulled him by the arm, and led him out. 
He $opened the door and sent him outside, [saying:] $Ignorant man, go far away! Don’t stay here! You can no longer participate $in gatherings of the sangha. 
As of now you have left it. 
You are not a $monk.381$He closed the door, locked it, and returned to the Buddha. 
Having paid $respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet, he stepped back, sat to one side, $and said: $I have expelled the monk about whom the World-honored One said that $one monk in the assembly was impure. 
World-honored One, the first watch $of the night has passed, the middle watch of the night has also ended, and $the last watch of the night is coming to an end. 
It is nearly dawn. 
Dawn $will be breaking before long. 
The Buddha and the assembly of monks $have been sitting together for a very long time. 
May the World-honored $One recite the code of rules! $The World-honored One said: $Mahāmoggallāna, that foolish person committed a great offense by troubling $the World-honored One and the assembly of monks. 
Mahāmoggallāna, if $the Tathāgata had recited the code of rules in an impure assembly [of $monks], the head of that [impure] man would have split into seven pieces.382$360$Division 11$For this reason, Mahāmoggallāna, from now on you are to recite the code $of rules [yourselves]. 
The Tathāgata will no longer recite the code of rules.383$Why is this? It is like this, Mahāmoggallāna. 
It may be that an ignorant $man practices right comprehension when coming and going; that he is $properly observant and discerning when bending, stretching, looking up, $and looking down; that he has a composed manner; that he skillfully wears $his outer robe and his other robes and [carries his] bowl; that he practices $right comprehension when walking, standing, sitting, and reclining, as well $as when sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent—all like a genuine $practitioner of the holy life.

$Mahāmoggallāna, it is just as if a householder had a good rice field or $wheat field, but there were to emerge in it a kind of weed called “impure $wheat,” whose roots, stem, nodes, leaves, and flowers all resembled those $of [genuine] wheat. 
Later, once [the impure wheat] had matured, the house￾holder would see it and think, “This is a pollutant and a disgrace to [gen￾uine] wheat, an abomination and a thorn to [genuine] wheat.” Having rec￾ognized it, he would pull it up and throw it out [of the field]. 
Why is that? $So as not to let it corrupt the genuine, good wheat.

$Then the World-honored One uttered these verses: $When assembled together you should recognize $[The one who harbors] evil desires, hatred, jealousy, anger, $The fetter of obstinate silence, malevolence, stinginess, $Jealousy, fawning, and deceit.

$Do not associate with him! $Reject him! Do not stay together with him! $Speaking much, he cheats and boasts, $Not calm, he claims to be calm.

^ck The Discourse on the $Renunciant Soṇa Kolivīsa384$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the venerable renunciant Soṇa Kolivīsa was also staying at $Sāvatthī, in the Blind [Men’s] Forest.385 He practiced diligently, not sleeping $during the first and the last watches of the night, and was rightly established $in the cultivation of the requisites of awakening. 
$Then, while the venerable renunciant Soṇa Kolivīsa was dwelling alone $quietly, sitting in meditation and reflecting, this thought came to his mind: $“Among the disciples of the World-honored One who diligently practice the $true Dharma and discipline, I am foremost. 
Yet my mind has not attained $liberation from the taints. 
My parents are very wealthy and prosperous; they $have a great deal of wealth. 
Should I now abandon the precepts, cease prac￾ticing the path, and engage in sensual pleasures, while practicing generosity $and doing meritorious deeds?” $At that time the World-honored One, by means of knowledge of the minds $of others, knew the thoughts in the mind of the venerable renunciant Soṇa $Kolivīsa. 
Then he told a certain monk, “Go and tell the renunciant Soṇa $Kolivīsa to come here.”386$At this the monk answered, “Yes.” Then he rose from his seat, paid homage $with his head at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and $left. 
Approaching the venerable renunciant Soṇa Kolivīsa, he said, “The $World-honored One summons you.” $The venerable renunciant Soṇa Kolivīsa, having heard the monk’s words, $approached the Buddha, paid homage with his head [at the Buddha’s feet], $stepped back, and sat to one side. 
The World-honored One said: $364^taisho612a Division 11$Renunciant, is it true that while you were dwelling alone quietly, sitting $in meditation and reflecting, this thought came to your mind: “Among $the disciples of the World-honored One who diligently practice the true $Dharma and discipline, I am foremost. 
Yet my mind has not attained lib￾eration from the taints. 
My parents are very wealthy and prosperous; they $have a great deal of wealth. 
Should I now abandon the precepts, cease $practicing the path, and engage in sensual pleasures, while practicing gen￾erosity and doing meritorious deeds?” $Then the venerable renunciant Soṇa Kolivīsa felt ashamed and was not $without trepidation [on realizing,] “The World-honored One knows what I $was thinking!”387 He extended his hands with palms together toward the $Buddha and said, “That is true.” $The World-honored One said: $Renunciant, I will now question you. 
Answer according to your under￾standing. 
What do you think? When you were living at home, you were $good at playing the lute harmoniously, with the lute in tune with the sound $of singing and the singing in tune with the sound of the lute; is that so? $The venerable renunciant Soṇa Kolivīsa said, “That is so, World-honored $One.” $The World-honored One asked further, “What do you think? If the strings $of the lute are [too] tight, can it produce a pleasant, harmonious sound?” $The renunciant answered, “No, World-honored One.” $The World-honored One asked further, “What do you think? If the strings $of the lute are [too] loose, can it produce a pleasant, harmonious sound?” $The renunciant answered, “No, World-honored One.” $The World-honored One asked again, “What do you think? If the strings $of the lute are neither [too] tight nor [too] loose but just right, in between, $can it produce a pleasant and harmonious sound?” $The renunciant answered, “That is so, World-honored One.” $The World-honored One said: $In the same way, renunciant, too much effort makes the mind become restless; $too little effort makes the mind indolent. 
Therefore, you should discriminate $like this at the proper time. 
Observe these features! Do not be negligent! $365^taisho612b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$At that time the venerable renunciant Soṇa Kolivīsa heard what the Buddha $said, received it well, and kept it well [in mind]. 
Then he rose from his seat, $paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three $times, and left. 
$Having received the Buddha’s instruction with the simile of playing the $lute, he dwelled alone in a secluded place and practiced diligently, without $negligence of mind. 
Dwelling alone in a secluded place and practicing dili￾gently, without negligence of mind, this son of a good family, who had shaved $off his hair and beard, donned the yellow robes, left home out of faith, and $become homeless to practice the path, realized in full the summit of the holy $life. 
He dwelled having personally achieved understanding, awakening, and $realization here and now. 
He knew as it really is: “Birth has been ended, the $holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done; there will $not be another experiencing of existence.” $The venerable renunciant Soṇa Kolivīsa, having understood the Dharma, $had become an arahant. 
At that time the venerable renunciant Soṇa Kolivīsa, $having become an arahant, thought, “Now is the right time. 
Should I approach $the World-honored One and declare my attainment of final knowledge?” $Then the venerable renunciant Soṇa Kolivīsa approached the Buddha. 
$Having paid homage with his head [at the Buddha’s feet], he stepped back, $sat to one side, and said: $World-honored One, if a monk has attained nonattachment and has com￾pletely destroyed the taints, [then for him] the holy life has been established, $what had to be done has been done, the heavy burden has been cast away, $the fetter of existence has been untied, and he has himself attained the $good benefits with right knowledge and right liberation. 
$At that time he delights in these six experiences: he delights in dispas￾sion, he delights in seclusion, he delights in nonconflict, he delights in $the cessation of craving, he delights in the cessation of clinging, and he $delights in imperturbability of the mind.388$World-honored One, perhaps someone may think, “This venerable one $delights in dispassion because he relies on faith,” [but] it should not be $seen like this. 
It is just [due to] the cessation of desire, the cessation of $hatred, and the cessation of ignorance that he delights in dispassion. 
$366$Division 11$World-honored One, perhaps someone may think, “This venerable one $delights in seclusion because he is greedy for material profit and fame, $seeking offerings,’ [but] it should not be seen like this. 
It is just [due to] $the cessation of desire, the cessation of hatred, and the cessation of igno￾rance that he delights in seclusion. 
$World-honored One, perhaps someone may think, “This venerable one $delights in nonconflict because he relies on the precepts,’ [but] it should $not be seen like this. 
It is just [due to] the cessation of desire, the cessation $of hatred, and the cessation of ignorance that he delights in nonconflict, $delights in the cessation of craving, delights in the cessation of clinging, $and delights in imperturbability of the mind. 
$World-honored One, if a monk has attained nonattachment and $exhausted the taints, [for him] the holy life has been established, what $had to be done has been done, the heavy burden has been cast away, the $fetter of existence has been untied, and he has personally attained the $good benefits with right comprehension and right liberation, then at that $time he delights in these six experiences. 
$World-honored One, if a monk in training, seeking the unsurpassable $peace of nirvana, has not yet attained his intention, at that time he has $accomplished the faculties of one in training and the moral habits of one $in training. 
At a later time he exhausts all taints and attains the taintless $liberation of the mind and liberation by wisdom. 
He dwells having per￾sonally achieved understanding, awakening, and realization here and now, $knowing as it really is: “Birth has been ended, the holy life has been estab￾lished, what had to be done has been done, there will not be another expe￾rience of existence.” At that time he has accomplished the faculties of one $beyond training and the moral habits of one beyond training. 
$World-honored One, it is just as a young boy who at that time [in his $life] has accomplished minor faculties and minor moral habits. 
At a later $time he becomes equipped with the faculties of one in training. 
At that $time he has accomplished the faculties of one in training and the moral $habits of one in training.389$In the same way, World-honored One, if a monk in training, seeking $the unsurpassable peace of nirvana, has not yet attained his intention, then $at that time he has accomplished the faculties of one in training and the $367^taisho612c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$moral habits of one in training. 
At a later time he exhausts all taints and $attains the taintless liberation of the mind and liberation by wisdom. 
He $dwells having personally achieved understanding, awakening, and real￾ization here and now, knowing as it really is: “Birth has been ended, the $holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, there $will not be another experience of existence.” At that time he has accom￾plished the faculties of one beyond training and the moral habits of one $beyond training. 
$If his eyes encounter forms perceivable by the eyes, then these will $not be able to make him lose this liberation of the mind and liberation by $wisdom; his mind remains established within, well controlled and guarded, $and he observes the rise and fall of phenomena. 
If ...
sounds perceivable $by the ears ...
odors perceivable by the nose ...
flavors perceivable by $the tongue ...
tangibles perceivable by the body ...
mental objects per￾ceivable by the mind, then these will not be able to make him lose this $liberation of the mind and liberation by wisdom; his mind remains estab￾lished within, well controlled and guarded, and he observes the rise and $fall of phenomena. 
$World-honored One, it is just as if not far from a village there is a great $rocky mountain without clefts, without chasms, not easily broken, solidly $fixed, without cavities, a single mass. 
If a strong wind and rain come from $the east they cannot shake or agitate [the mountain], nor can the east wind $move [the mountain aside] to the south. 
If a strong wind and rain come $from the south they cannot shake or agitate [the mountain], nor can the $south wind move [the mountain aside] to the west. 
If a strong wind and $rain come from the west they cannot shake and agitate [the mountain], $nor can the west wind move [the mountain aside] to the north. 
If a strong $wind and rain come from the north they cannot shake and agitate [the moun￾tain], nor can the north wind move [the mountain aside] in any direction. 
$In the same way, if his eyes encounter forms perceivable by the eyes, $these will not be able to make him lose this liberation of the mind and $liberation by wisdom; his mind stays established within, well controlled $and guarded, and he observes the rise and fall of phenomena. 
If [his senses $encounter] sounds perceivable by the ears ...

mental objects perceivable by the mind, these will not be $able to make him lose this liberation of the mind and liberation by wisdom; $his mind stays established within, well controlled and guarded, and he $observes the rise and fall of phenomena. 
$Then the venerable renunciant Soṇa Kolivīsa uttered these verses: $One who delights in dispassion $Whose mind dwells in seclusion $Delights in being without conflict $And rejoices in the cessation of clinging. 
$One who also delights in the cessation of clinging $And in the imperturbability of the mind $On attaining true knowledge, $Through this his mind is liberated. 
$On attaining liberation of the mind, $A monk’s faculties are calmed. 
$That accomplished, he need look no further; $There is no further seeking to be done. 
$Just as a rocky mountain $Is not agitated by the wind, $So too forms, sounds, odors, flavors $And tangibles, $Things lovable and unlovable, $Cannot agitate the mind.390$The venerable renunciant Soṇa Kolivīsa, having proclaimed before the $Buddha his attainment of final knowledge, rose from his seat, paid homage $with his head at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and left. 
$At that time, soon after the venerable renunciant Soṇa Kolivīsa had left, $the World-honored One told the monks: $Sons of a good family should proclaim before me their attainment of final $knowledge, just as the venerable renunciant Soṇa Kolivīsa proclaimed $before me his attainment of final knowledge. 
Without praising himself or $369$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$looking down on others, he told of the benefits here and now, according $to his experience. 
$Let no ignorant ones, entangled in excessive conceit, come before me $and proclaim attainment of final knowledge! They have obtained no ben￾efits but instead big trouble. 
$The venerable renunciant Soṇa Kolivīsa proclaimed before me his attain￾ment of final knowledge without praising himself or looking down on $others. 
He told of the benefits here and now, according to his experience. 
$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks $were delighted and received it respectfully.

^ck The Discourse on $Eight Obstacles391$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $For one who [intends to] practice the holy life, there are eight obstacles, $eight untimely conditions. 
What are the eight? $At the time when a tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened, $accomplished in knowledge and conduct, a well-gone one, a knower of $the world, an unsurpassable person, leader on the path of Dharma, teacher $of devas and human beings, called a buddha, an exalted one, has appeared $in the world and teaches the Dharma that leads to calmness, leads to com￾plete cessation, leads to the path of awakening expounded by the Well￾gone One—at that time this person is reborn in hell. 
This is the first obstacle, $the first untimely condition for one who [intends to] practice the holy life. 
$Again, at the time when a tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awak￾ened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, a well-gone one, a knower $of the world, an unsurpassable person, leader on the path of Dharma, $teacher of devas and human beings, called a buddha, an exalted one, has $appeared in the world and teaches the Dharma that leads to calmness, $leads to complete cessation, leads to the path of awakening expounded $by the Well-gone One—at that time this person is reborn in the realm of $animals ...
is reborn in the realm of hungry ghosts ...
is reborn in a $370^taisho613b Division 11$heaven of long life ...
is reborn in a border country among barbarians $who have no faith and no kindness, who are ungrateful, where there are $no monks, nuns, or male and female lay disciples. 
This is the fifth obstacle, $the fifth untimely condition for one who [intends to] practice the holy life. 
$Again, at the time when a tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awak￾ened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, a well-gone one, a knower $of the world, an unsurpassable person, leader on the path of Dharma, $teacher of devas and human beings, called a buddha, an exalted one, has $appeared in the world and teaches the Dharma that leads to calmness, $leads to complete cessation, leads to the path of awakening expounded $by the Well-gone One—at that time this person is reborn in the Middle $Kingdom, but he is deaf and dumb like a bleating sheep, only able to com￾municate through sign language, unable to understand whether the meaning $of what is said is good or evil. 
This is the sixth obstacle, the sixth untimely $condition for one who [intends to] practice the holy life. 
$Again, at the time when a tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awak￾ened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, a well-gone one, a knower $of the world, an unsurpassable person, leader on the path of Dharma, $teacher of devas and human beings, called a buddha, an exalted one, has $appeared in the world and teaches the Dharma that leads to calmness, $leads to complete cessation, leads to the path of awakening expounded $by the Well-gone One—at that time this person is reborn in the Middle $Kingdom, he is not deaf and not dumb like a bleating sheep, does not only $communicate through sign language, is able to understand whether the $meaning of what is said is good or evil, yet he possesses wrong and per￾verted views, holding views and doctrines such as these: there is no [merit $in] giving, no offering, and no recitation of hymns; there is no [distinction $between] wholesome and unwholesome actions; there is no result of $wholesome and unwholesome actions; there is neither this life nor the $next life; there is no [responsibility toward one’s] mother or father; in this $world there are no arahants who have reached a good attainment, who are $well gone, well advanced, who have personally realized this world and $the next world through understanding, awakening, and realization.

$This is the eighth obstacle, the eighth untimely condition for one who $[intends to] practice the holy life. 
$For one who [intends to] practice the holy life, there is [one occasion] $that is without obstacle, that is the timely condition. 
What is the [one occa￾sion] for one who [intends to] practice the holy life that is without obstacle $and is the timely condition? At the time when a tathāgata, free from attach￾ment, fully awakened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, a well￾gone one, a knower of the world, an unsurpassable person, leader on the $path of Dharma, teacher of devas and human beings, called a buddha, an $exalted one, has appeared in the world and teaches the Dharma that leads $to calmness, leads to complete cessation, leads to the path of awakening $expounded by the Well-gone One—at that time this person is reborn in $the Middle Kingdom, he is not deaf and not dumb like a bleating sheep, $does not only communicate through sign language, is able to understand $whether the meaning of what is said is good or evil, and is equipped with $right view, not perverted views, holding such views and doctrines as these: $there is [merit in] giving, offerings, and the recitation of charms; there is $372^taisho613c Division 11$[a distinction between] wholesome and unwholesome actions; there is a $result of wholesome and unwholesome actions; there is this life and the $next life; there is [responsibility toward one’s] mother or father; in this $world there are arahants who have reached a good attainment, who are $well gone, well advanced, who have personally realized this world and $the next world through understanding, awakening, and realization. 
This $is [the one occasion] for one who [intends to] practice the holy life that $is without obstacle, that is a timely condition. 
$Then the World-honored One uttered these verses: $If one has obtained a human body $And the most sublime Dharma is being taught, $Yet he does not attain any fruit, $Then this is certainly because he did not encounter the [right] time for it. 
$Many obstacles to [practicing] the holy life have been taught. 
$For a person to encounter $The [right] time in the next life $Is very rare in the world. 
$If one wishes to obtain a human body again $And to hear the sublime Dharma, $Then one should practice diligently, $Out of concern for oneself. 
$As for talking about and hearing the good Dharma, $Do not miss the [right] time for it. 
$If [one] misses this [right] time, $One should certainly worry about falling into hell. 
$If one does not encounter the [right] time, $And does not hear the good Dharma taught, $Then [one is] like a merchant who loses his wealth; $One will endure countless births and deaths. 
$If one obtains a human body, $Hears the right and good Dharma being taught, $373^taisho614a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$And respectfully follows the teaching of the World-honored One, $Then one must have encountered the [right] time for it. 
$If one encounters this [right] time, $And is able to practice the right holy life, $Then one will achieve the unsurpassable vision, $Taught by the Kinsman of the Sun. 
$Such a person constantly guards himself, $And practices in abandoning the latent tendencies. 
$By removing and extinguishing all fetters, $And by defeating the Evil One [Māra] and the Evil One’s retinue, $He transcends the world; $That is, he achieves the cessation of the taints. 
$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks $were delighted and received it respectfully.

At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks, “For a worldly $person who has sensual desires, is poverty a great suffering?” $The monks answered, “Yes, World-honored One, it is.” $The World-honored One further asked the monks: $If a person who has sensual desires is poor, he may raise a loan from $another family’s wealth. 
Is raising a loan from another family’s wealth a $great suffering in the world? $The monks answered, “Yes, World-honored One, it is.” $The World-honored One further asked the monks: $If a person who has sensual desires raises a loan and is unable to repay it $on time, the interest increases day by day. 
Is the increasing interest a great $suffering in the world? $The monks answered, “Yes, World-honored One, it is.” $374$Division 11$The World-honored One further asked the monks: $If a person who has sensual desires is unable to pay the increasing interest $the creditor asks for repayment [of the debt]. 
Is being asked by a creditor $[for repayment of a debt] a great suffering in the world? $The monks answered, “Yes, World-honored One, it is.” $The World-honored One further asked the monks: $If a person who has sensual desires is asked by the creditor [for repayment $of a debt] and is unable to repay it, the creditor pursues him and asks again $and again [for repayment]. 
Is being pursued by a creditor and asked again $and again [for repayment] a great suffering in the world? $The monks answered, “Yes, World-honored One, it is.” $The World-honored One further asked the monks: $For a person who has sensual desires, if the creditor pursues him and asks $again and again [for repayment], and because of being unable to repay $[the loan] he is arrested and bound by the creditor. 
Is being arrested and $bound by a creditor a great suffering in the world? $The monks answered, “Yes, World-honored One, it is.” $[The World-honored One said:] $This means that for a person who has sensual desires, poverty is a great $suffering in the world; for a person who has sensual desires, raising a loan $is a great suffering in the world; for a person who has sensual desires, the $increasing interest from raising a loan is a great suffering in the world; for $a person who has sensual desires, being asked by a creditor [for repayment $of a loan] is a great suffering in the world; for a person who has sensual $desires, being pursued by a creditor and asked again and again [for repay￾ment] is a great suffering in the world; for a person who has sensual desires, $being arrested and bound by a creditor is a great suffering in the world. 
$In the same way, if someone in this noble Dharma has no faith in [the $value of] wholesome states, does not keep the precepts, is not learned, is $not generous, and lacks wisdom regarding wholesome states, then for that $reason he is poor and powerless, even if he possesses great amounts of $375^taisho614b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$gold, silver, beryl, crystal, maṇi jewels, white jade, conch shell, coral, $amber, agate, tortoise shell, cornelian, green jade, ruby, and jade pearl.394$This is what I speak of in my noble teaching as the unwholesomeness $[resembling] poverty. 
$[This person] engages in evil conduct of body, speech, and mind. 
This $is what I speak of in my noble teaching as the unwholesomeness [resem￾bling] raising a loan. 
He wishes to cover up his evil bodily conduct; he $does not disclose it himself, does not want to talk about it, does not want $to be rebuked by others, and does not do as they ask. 
He wishes to cover $up his evil verbal and mental conduct; he does not disclose it himself, $does not want to talk about it, does not want to be rebuked by others, and $does not do as they ask. 
This is what I speak of in my noble teaching as $the unwholesomeness [resembling] the increase in interest due. 
$Whether he is practicing inside a village or town or outside a village $or town, his companions in the holy life, on seeing him, speak like this, $“Venerable friends, this man acts like this, behaves like this, is evil like $this, is impure like this; he is a thorn to the village or town.” He speaks $like this, “Venerable sirs, I do not act like this, do not behave like this, $am not evil like this, not impure like this; I am not a thorn to the village $or town.” This is what I speak of in my noble teaching as the unwhole￾someness [resembling] the demand for repayment. 
$Whether he is dwelling in a secluded place, on a mountain, at the base $of a tree in a forest, or in an open place, he thinks three kinds of unwhole￾some thoughts, [namely,] thoughts of sensual desire, thoughts of hatred, $and thoughts of harming. 
This is what I speak of in my noble teaching as $the unwholesomeness [resembling] repeated pursuit. 
$He engages in evil bodily, verbal, and mental conduct. 
Owing to his $evil bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, because of this, at the breaking $up of the body at death, he will certainly go to a bad realm of existence, $and be reborn in hell. 
This is what I speak of in my noble teaching as the $unwholesomeness [resembling] arrest and bondage. 
$I see no other bondage as miserable, as severe, as harsh, and as unde￾sirable as the bondage of hell or of [rebirth] as an animal or a hungry ghost. 
$A monk who is an arahant, who has achieved destruction of the $taints, knows that these three miserable kinds of bondage have been $376$Division 11$destroyed completely, that they have been pulled out by the roots, never $to grow again.395$Then the World-honored One uttered these verses: $In the world poverty is suffering, $[So too is] raising a loan from another’s wealth. 
$Having raised such a loan, $Being asked [to repay it] is suffering and distress. 
$The creditor approaches him and asks [for repayment]; $Because of this, [being unable to repay it,] he is arrested and bound. 
$This bondage is very severe suffering $For a worldly person who delights in sensual pleasures. 
$It is the same in the noble Dharma $For one who is without right faith, $Who has no sense of shame or guilt, $And performs evil, unwholesome deeds. 
$With his body he performs unwholesome deeds, $And also with his speech and mind. 
$He covers them up, does not want to talk about them, $And does not like being rightly instructed and admonished. 
$If someone performs [such deeds] again and again, $His mind and thoughts experience suffering. 
$Whether in a village or in a secluded place, $He will certainly experience regret because of it. 
$With body and speech he performs such deeds, $And also with the thoughts in his mind. 
$His evil deeds increase more and more, $[As] he performs them again and again. 
$[Committing] evil actions and lacking wisdom, $Having done much that is unwholesome, $Accordingly, when his life comes to its end, $He will certainly go to the bondage of hell. 
$377^taisho614c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$This bondage is the most profound suffering. 
$A “hero,” [however,] is free from it. 
$One who obtains wealth in accordance with the Dharma $Will not incur debt but will be at peace. 
$Giving brings happiness; $It is profitable in both respects [in present and future lives]. 
$In this way householders $Increase their merit through giving. 
$It is the same in the noble Dharma; $For one who has good and sincere faith $And is equipped with a sense of shame and guilt $Who will certainly be without stinginess or greed. 
$Having abandoned the five hindrances, $He always delights in practicing diligently. 
$Attaining the concentrative absorptions, $He is filled with lasting peace and happiness.396$Having attained an unworldly happiness, $Purified as if bathed with water, $His imperturbable mind is liberated, $And all bonds of existence are eradicated. 
$Nirvana is freedom from ailment; $It is called the unsurpassable lamp.397$Freedom from grief, freedom from dust, and peace: $This is called “the imperturbable.” $Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks $were delighted and received it respectfully.

What are the ten? $Householder, one kind of person who engages in sensual pleasures $seeks wealth in improper ways, contrary to the Dharma.

$At that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Buddha, paid $homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet, stepped back, and sat to one side. 
$He said, “World-honored One, how many kinds of persons are there in the $world who are fields of merit?” $383^taisho616a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$The World-honored One said: $Householder, in the world there are altogether two kinds of persons who $are fields of merit. 
What are the two? The first is the person who is in $training. 
The second is the person who is beyond training. 
Of persons $who are in training there are eighteen kinds, and of persons who are beyond $training there are nine kinds.403$Householder, what are the eighteen kinds of persons in training? The $faith follower, the Dharma follower, the one liberated by faith, the one $who has attained vision, the body witness, the one who goes from clan $to clan, the one-seeder,404 the one on the path to stream-entry, the one who $has attained stream-entry, the one on the path to once-returning, the one $who has attained once-returning, the one on the path to nonreturning, the $one who has attained nonreturning, the one who attains final nirvana in $between, the one who attains final nirvana on being reborn, the one who $attains final nirvana with effort, the one who attains final nirvana without $effort, and the one who proceeds upstream to Akaniṭṭha Heaven; these $are the eighteen kinds of persons in training. 
$Householder, what are the nine kinds of persons beyond training?405 $[They are] the one who is capable at will [of putting an end to existence] $(cetanādharman); the one who is capable of penetrating [without effort] $(prativedhanādharman); the one who is in an immovable condition $(akopya dharman); the one who is liable to regress (parihāṇadharman); $the one who is not liable to regress (aparihāṇadharman); the one who is $capable of protecting (anurakṣaṇādharman), [that is,] who while protecting $himself will not regress, but if he does not protect himself he will regress; $the one who is in a condition of standing firmly (sthitākampya); the one $who is liberated by wisdom; and the one who is liberated on both sides. 
$These are the nine kinds of persons who are beyond training. 
$Then the World-honored One uttered these verses: $In the world those who are in training and those who are beyond training $Are worthy of respect, worthy of offerings. 
$They are accomplished in maintaining correct [conduct of] body, $And of speech and mind as well. 
$384$Division 11$Householder, these are excellent fields [of merit]; $One who makes offerings to them gains great merit. 
$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the householder $Anāthapiṇḍika and the monks were delighted and received it respectfully. 
$128. 
^ck The Discourse on $Male Lay Disciples406$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, accompanied by a large $assembly of five hundred male lay disciples, approached Venerable Sāriputta. 
$He paid homage with his head [at the feet of Venerable Sāriputta], stepped $back, and sat to one side. 
The five hundred male lay disciples also paid hom￾age, stepped back, and sat to one side. 
$After the householder Anāthapiṇḍika and the five hundred male lay dis￾ciples had sat down to one side, Venerable Sāriputta taught them the Dharma, $exhorting and inspiring them, fully delighting them. 
Having with countless $skillful means taught them the Dharma, having exhorted and inspired them, $fully delighting them, [Venerable Sāriputta] rose from his seat and approached $the Buddha. 
He paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet, stepped $back, and sat to one side. 
Not long after Venerable Sāriputta had left, the $householder Anāthapiṇḍika and the five hundred male lay disciples also $approached the Buddha, paid homage with their heads at the Buddha’s feet, $stepped back, and sat to one side.407$Once Venerable Sāriputta and the [lay] assembly were properly seated, $the World-honored One addressed them saying: $Sāriputta, if regarding a noble lay disciple you know that he is well guarded $by practicing five principles, and that he attains easily and without difficulty $four higher states of mind that are happy abodes here and now, then, $Sāriputta, you can declare that for that noble disciple [rebirth] in hell is $ended,408 and also [rebirth] as an animal, as a hungry ghost, or into any $[other] bad realm of existence. 
He has attained stream-entry. 
He will not $descend into any evil condition but will certainly progress toward full $awakening; and after experiencing at most seven existences, coming and $385^taisho616b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$going among devas and human beings [at most] seven times, he will attain $the ending of dukkha.$Sāriputta, how is a noble lay disciple well guarded by practicing five $principles?409 A noble lay disciple abstains from killing, has given up $killing, has discarded sword and club. 
He has a sense of shame and fears $blame, and a mind [full of] loving-kindness and compassion, [wishing] $to benefit all [beings], even insects. 
He has purified his mind with regard $to killing living beings. 
A noble lay disciple is well guarded by practicing $this first principle. 
$Again, Sāriputta, a noble lay disciple abstains from taking what is not $given, has given up taking what is not given. 
He takes [only] what is given $and delights in taking [only] what is given. 
He is always fond of generosity, $rejoicing in it, without stinginess, and not expecting any reward. 
He con￾stantly guards himself so as not to be overcome by [any thought of] steal￾ing. 
He has purified his mind with regard to taking what is not given. 
A $noble lay disciple is well guarded by practicing this second principle. 
$Again, Sāriputta, a noble lay disciple abstains from sexual misconduct, $has given up sexual misconduct. 
If a woman is being guarded by her $father, guarded by her mother, guarded by her parents, guarded by her $brothers, or guarded by her sisters; or if a woman is guarded by her par￾ents-in-law, guarded by her relatives, or guarded by her clan; or if she has $been promised in marriage or is protected by threat of punishment, or has $been garlanded as a sign of betrothal—[then he] does not violate such a $woman. 
He has purified his mind with regard to sexual misconduct. 
A $noble lay disciple is well guarded by practicing this third principle. 
$Again, Sāriputta, a noble lay disciple abstains from false speech, has $given up false speech. 
He speaks the truth, delights in the truth, is unshak￾ably established in the truth, is completely trustworthy, and will not deceive $[anyone in] the world. 
He has purified his mind with regard to false speech. 
$A noble lay disciple is well guarded by practicing this fourth principle. 
$Again, Sāriputta, a noble lay disciple abstains from intoxicants, has $given up intoxicants. 
He has purified his mind with regard to intoxicants. 
$A noble lay disciple is well guarded by practicing this fifth principle. 
$Sāriputta, what are the four higher states of mind that are happy abodes $here and now, which a noble lay disciple attains easily and without difficulty? $386^taisho616c Division 11$A noble lay disciple recollects the Tathāgata [thus], “That is the Tathāgata, $free from attachment, fully awakened, accomplished in knowledge and $conduct, a Well-gone One, a knower of the world, unsurpassable person, $leader on the path of Dharma, teacher of devas and human beings, called $Buddha, an Exalted One.” When he recollects the Tathāgata in this way, $if there are [in his mind] any evil desires they disappear right away. 
If $there are in his mind unwholesome and defiling [states causing] distress, $worry, and grief, then they too disappear. 
$For a noble lay disciple who is established in [recollection of] the $Tathāgata, his mind is pacified and attains joy. 
If [in his mind] there are $any evil desires, then they disappear right away. 
[If] in his mind there are $unwholesome and defiling [states causing] distress, worry, and grief, then $they too disappear. 
A noble lay disciple attains, easily and without difficulty, $this first higher state of mind that is a happy abode here and now. 
$Again, Sāriputta, a noble lay disciple recollects the Dharma [thus], $“The Dharma that is well taught by the World-honored One definitely $leads to the ultimate, to freedom from vexation and affliction; it exists $continuously and is immovable.”410 When he contemplates in this way, $understands in this way, knows in this way, and recollects the Dharma in $this way, then if [in his mind] there are any evil desires, they disappear $right away. 
If in his mind there are any unwholesome and defiling [states $causing] distress, worry, and grief, then they too disappear. 
$For a noble lay disciple who is established in [recollection of] the $Dharma, his mind is pacified and attains joy. 
If [in his mind] there are any $evil desires, then they disappear right away. 
[If] in his mind there are any $unwholesome and defiling [states causing] distress, worry, and grief, then $they too disappear. 
A noble lay disciple attains [easily and without difficulty] $this second higher state of mind [that is a happy abode here and now]. 
$Again, Sāriputta, a noble lay disciple recollects the sangha [thus], “The $noble sangha of the Tathāgata is proceeding well and proceeding rightly, $progressing in the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma, and conforming $to the Dharma. 
In the sangha there are indeed arahants and those on the $path to arahantship, nonreturners and those on the path to nonreturning, $once-returners and those on the path to once-returning, stream-enterers $and those on the path to stream-entry. 
These are reckoned the four pairs $387$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$or the eight classes [of noble ones]. 
These are reckoned the sangha of the $Tathāgata. 
They have achieved morality, they have achieved concentration, $they have achieved wisdom, they have achieved liberation, and they have $achieved knowledge and vision of liberation.411 They are worthy of respect $and esteem, worthy of offerings, and are an excellent field of merit in the $world.” When [a noble lay disciple] recollects the sangha of the Tathāgata $in this way, then if [in his mind] there are any evil desires, they disappear $right away. 
If in his mind there are any unwholesome and defiling [states $causing] distress, worry, and grief, then they too disappear. 
$For a noble lay disciple who is established in [recollection of] the $sangha of the Tathāgata, his mind is pacified and attains joy. 
If [in his $mind] there are any evil desires, then they disappear right away. 
[If] in $his mind there are any unwholesome and defiling [states causing] distress, $worry, and grief, then they too disappear. 
A noble lay disciple attains, $easily and without difficulty, this third higher state of mind that is a happy $abode here and now. 
$Again, Sāriputta, a noble lay disciple recollects his own morality [thus], $“This morality [of mine] is not deficient, not defective. 
It is free from $defilement and corruption, established [firmly] like the earth, not hollow.412$It is praised by the noble ones, well received and remembered.” When he $recollects his own morality in this way, if [in his mind] there are any evil $desires, then they disappear right away. 
If in his mind there are any $unwholesome and defiling [states causing], distress, worry, and grief, then $they too disappear. 
$For a noble lay disciple who is established in [recollection of] morality, $his mind is pacified and attains joy. 
If [in his mind] there are any evil $desires, then they disappear right away. 
[If] in his mind there are any $unwholesome and defiling [states causing] distress, worry, and grief, then $they too disappear. 
A noble lay disciple attains, easily and without difficulty, $this fourth higher state of mind that is a happy abode here and now. 
$Sāriputta, if regarding a noble lay disciple you know that he is well $guarded by practicing these five principles, and that he attains easily and $without difficulty these four higher states of mind that are happy abodes $here and now, then, Sāriputta, you can declare that for that noble disciple $[rebirth] in hell is ended, and also [rebirth] as an animal, a hungry ghost, $388^taisho617a Division 11$or in any [other] bad realm of existence. 
He has attained stream-entry. 
He $will not descend into any evil condition but will certainly progress toward $full awakening; and after experiencing at most seven existences, coming $and going among devas and human beings [at most] seven times, he will $attain the ending of dukkha.$Then the World-honored One uttered these verses: $A wise man who dwells in the household, $Discerns the fearfulness of hell. 
$Due to receiving and retaining the noble Dharma, $He eliminates every kind of evil. 
$He abstains from killing or harming living beings, $Being able to abandon this with understanding. 
$He speaks the truth, not what is false. 
$He does not steal others’ property. 
$Satisfied with his own wife, $He does not take delight in another’s wife. 
$He has given up intoxicants and abstains from them, $[Knowing them to be] a source of mental confusion, madness, and $ ignorance. 
$[One] should often recollect the Fully Awakened One, $Reflect on the wholesome teachings, $Recollect the sangha, and contemplate [one’s own] morality. 
$From this [one] will gain joy. 
$Wishing to practice giving, $One should consider the anticipated merit of it, $And give first to [those who are of] calmed mind. 
$Such [giving] brings [good] results. 
$I will now speak of [those with] calmed minds. 
$Sāriputta, listen attentively! $[An ox] may be black or white, $Red or brown, $389^taisho617b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Mottled with delightful colors, $Or having the color of a dove, $According to its inborn state; $[But] the well-trained ox is foremost. 
$[If] it has adequate bodily strength $And goes at a good speed, quickly back and forth, $Then it will be selected for its capability $And not rejected for its color. 
$In the same way, a human being $May be born into different estates: $As warrior or brahmin $Or merchant or laborer, $According to his inborn state. 
$An elder who is pure and keeps the precepts, $Who is without worldly attachment, a well-gone one413— $Giving alms to him brings great fruit. 
$As for someone who is ignorant, who lacks knowledge, $Lacks wisdom, lacks learning— $Giving alms to him brings little fruit.414$Lacking the light [of wisdom], [such a person] illuminates no one. 
$If the light [of wisdom] shines $On a wise disciple of the Buddha $Whose faith in the Well-gone One $Is well rooted and firmly established, $[Then] that person will be reborn into a good estate, $In a family of his choice, $And in the end will attain nirvana. 
$In these ways each one has his destiny. 
$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, Venerable $Sāriputta, the monks, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, and the five hundred $male lay disciples were delighted and received it respectfully. 
$390$Division 11$129. 
^ck The Discourse on $the Enemy415$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $There are seven states of enmity that make for the enmity that comes upon $a man or a woman when they become angry. 
What are the seven? $An enemy does not want his enemy to be good-looking. 
Why is that? $[Because] an enemy does not delight in his enemy being good-looking. 
$A person who is angry, who repeatedly becomes angry, who is overcome $by anger, and whose mind does not abandon anger has an ugly appearance $because of this, even if he is well bathed and his body is anointed with $fine fragrance. 
Why is that? Because he is overcome by anger and his $mind does not abandon anger. 
This is the first state of enmity that makes $for the enmity that comes upon a man or woman when they become angry. 
$Again, an enemy does not want his enemy to sleep in peace. 
Why is $that? [Because] an enemy does not delight in his enemy sleeping in peace. 
$A person who is angry, who repeatedly becomes angry, who is overcome $by anger, and whose mind does not abandon anger sleeps in distress $because of this, even if he is lying on a royal bed upholstered with wool $textiles, draped with brocades and fine silk fabrics, with lined and quilted $coverlets, and with cushions [made of] antelope hide at both ends. 
Why $is that? Because he is overcome by anger and his mind does not abandon $anger. 
This is the second state of enmity that makes for the enmity that $comes upon a man or woman when they become angry. 
$Again, an enemy does not want his enemy to make a large profit. 
$Why is that? [Because] an enemy does not delight in his enemy making $a large profit. 
$A person who is angry, who repeatedly becomes angry, who is overcome $by anger, and whose mind does not abandon anger does not [try to] make $a profit when he should [try to] make a profit, and [tries to] make a profit $when he should not [try to] make a profit. 
In both cases he acts contrary $[to what is appropriate], so he has a big loss. 
Why is that? Because he is $391^taisho617c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$overcome by anger and his mind does not abandon anger. 
This is the third $state of enmity that makes for the enmity that comes upon a man or woman $when they become angry. 
$Again, an enemy does not want his enemy to have friends. 
Why is $that? [Because] an enemy does not delight in his enemy having friends. 
$For a person who is angry, who repeatedly becomes angry, who is over￾come by anger, and whose mind does not abandon anger, if he has good $friends they leave him and go away. 
Why is that? Because he is overcome $by anger and his mind does not abandon anger. 
This is the fourth state of $enmity that makes for the enmity that comes upon a man or woman when $they become angry. 
$Again, an enemy does not want his enemy to have a good reputation. 
$Why is that? [Because] an enemy does not delight in his enemy having $a good reputation. 
$A person who is angry, who repeatedly becomes angry, who is overcome $by anger, and whose mind does not abandon anger gains ill fame, a bad $reputation, which becomes widely known in all directions. 
Why is that? $Because he is overcome by anger and his mind does not abandon anger. 
$This is the fifth state of enmity that makes for the enmity that comes upon $a man or woman when they become angry. 
$Again, an enemy does not want his enemy to be very wealthy. 
Why is $that? [Because] an enemy does not delight in his enemy being very wealthy. 
$A person who is angry, who repeatedly becomes angry, who is overcome $by anger, and whose mind does not abandon anger engages in conduct of $body, speech, and mind that causes him to lose a great deal of wealth.416$Why is that? Because he is overcome by anger and his mind does not $abandon anger. 
This is the sixth state of enmity that makes for the enmity $that comes upon a man or woman when they become angry. 
$Again, an enemy does not want his enemy, at the breaking up of the $body at death, to be certain of going to a good realm of existence, a heav￾enly world. 
Why is that? [Because] an enemy does not delight in his enemy $going to a good realm of existence. 
$A person who is angry, who repeatedly becomes angry, who is overcome $by anger, and whose mind does not abandon anger engages in evil conduct $of body, speech, and mind. 
Having engaged in evil conduct of body, $392^taisho618a Division 11$speech, and mind, at the breaking up of the body at death, he will certainly $go to a bad realm of existence, being reborn in hell. 
Why is that? Because $he is overcome by anger and his mind does not abandon anger. 
This is $the seventh state of enmity that makes for the enmity that comes upon a $man or woman when they become angry. 
These are the seven states of $enmity that make for the enmity that comes upon a man or woman when $they become angry. 
$Then the World-honored One uttered these verses: $One who is angry acquires an ugly appearance, $He sleeps uneasily and in distress. 
$Though he should gain great wealth, $He instead incurs loss. 
$[Even those who were his] close good friends $Keep their distance from a person who becomes angry. 
$As he repeatedly becomes angry, $His bad reputation spreads in all directions. 
$He is angry when engaging in activities of body or speech, $And entangled in anger when engaging in activities of the mind. 
$A person overcome by anger $Loses all his wealth. 
$Anger produces disadvantage; $Anger produces defilement of the mind. 
$Fear arises within [such] a person, $Yet he is unable to realize this. 
$One who is angry does not recognize what is advantageous; $One who is angry does not know the Dharma. 
$Lacking sight, blind, enveloped in darkness: $Such is the person who delights in anger. 
$Anger first manifests as an ugly appearance, $Just as fire first starts by giving out smoke. 
$From this arise hatred and jealousy; $And as a consequence of this, everyone becomes angry. 
$393$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$What an angry person does, $Whether wholesome or unwholesome deeds, $After having become full of anger,417$He feels scorched as if burned by fire. 
$What I have called scorching deeds $And entangling [mental] states $I will now explain one by one. 
$All of you, listen attentively! $One who is angry will turn against his father and harm him, $And against his brothers too. 
$He will even kill his sisters. 
$So harmful is one who is angry. 
$[The one] who gave birth to him and raised him, $Who enabled him to see this world, $Who enabled him to survive: his mother. 
$Even her the angry one will harm.418$Without shame, without scruple, $For one who is entangled by anger there is nothing he will [not be $ ready] to say. 
$For a person overcome by anger, $There is nothing [bad] that his mouth will not utter. 
$He performs ignorant and immoral deeds,419$And takes his own life at a young age. 
$When doing this he lacks self-awareness; $Because of anger, terrifying things occur. 
$He is attached to himself, $And loves himself extremely; $Yet despite loving himself, $One who is angry also harms himself. 
$He stabs himself with a knife, $Or flings himself off a cliff, $394^taisho618b Division 11$Or hangs himself with a rope, $Or takes various kinds of poison. 
$Such is the nature of anger; $His death is due to anger. 
$All of this can be abandoned, $By understanding it with wisdom. 
$As for tiny unwholesome deeds, $A wise person is able to discard them by understanding them. 
$One should be patient with such behavior, $If one wishes to be free of ugliness, $To be free of anger and free of worry, $To remove the smoke of conceit and be free of it, $To tame anger and abandon it, $To eradicate it completely and be free of the taints. 
$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks $were delighted and received it respectfully. 
$130. 
^ck The Discourse on $Teaching Dhammika420$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time Venerable Dhammika was an elder in his native region. 
He $was in charge of the stupa, and he held a senior position relative to [others, $but he] was irascible, impatient, and very coarse, [given to] berating and $condemning other monks. 
Because of this, all the [other] monks of [Dham￾mika’s] native region left and went away. 
They did not enjoy staying there. 
$Then the laymen of the region, seeing that all the monks of the region were $leaving and going away, because they did not enjoy staying there, thought, $“Why do all the monks of the region leave and go away, not delighting in $staying here?” $The laymen of the region heard about Venerable Dhammika, an elder in $his native region, [as follows]. 
He was in charge of the stupa and he held a $senior position relative to [others, but he] was irascible, impatient, and very $395$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$coarse, [given to] berating and condemning other monks. 
Because of this, $all the [other] monks of [Dhammika’s] native region left and went away. 
$They did not enjoy staying there. 
Hearing this, the laymen of [Dhammika’s] $birthplace together approached Venerable Dhammika and expelled him from $the monasteries of his native region.421$At this Venerable Dhammika, having been expelled from the monasteries $of his native region by the laymen of his native region, took his robes and $bowl and headed for Sāvatthī. 
Traveling in stages, he reached Sāvatthī and $stayed in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$Then Venerable Dhammika approached the Buddha, paid homage with $his head at the Buddha’s feet, stepped back, and sat to one side. 
He said: $World-honored One, I did not revile the laymen of my native region, I $did not berate them, I did not give offense to them. 
Yet the laymen of my $native region have driven me from the monasteries of my native region. 
$Then the World-honored One told him, “Stop, Dhammika! Stop! Why do $you need to say this?”422$Venerable Dhammika extended his hands with palms together toward the $Buddha, and again said: $World-honored One, I did not revile the laymen of my native region, I $did not berate them, I did not give offense to them. 
Yet the laymen of my $native region have driven me from the monasteries of my native region. 
$The World-honored One again addressed him: $Dhammika, long ago merchants here in Jambudīpa would set out on the $ocean by boat, carrying with them a land-seeking bird of prey. 
Before going $far on the great ocean, they would release the land-seeking bird of prey. 
If $the land-seeking bird of prey was able to reach the coast of the great ocean, $it would not return to the boat; but if the land-seeking bird of prey was not $able to reach the coast of the great ocean, it would return to the boat. 
In the $same way, Dhammika, since you have been expelled from the monasteries $of your native region by the laymen of your native region, you return to $me. 
Stop, Dhammika! Stop! Why do you need to say this again? $A third time Venerable Dhammika said: $396^taisho618c Division 11$World-honored One, I did not revile the laymen of my native region, I $did not berate them, I did not give offense to them. 
Yet the laymen of my $native region have driven me from the monasteries of my native region. 
$A third time the World-honored One addressed him: $Dhammika, when you were expelled from the monasteries of your native $region by the laymen of your native region, did you abide by the Dharma $of a renunciant? $At this Venerable Dhammika rose from his seat, extended his hands with $palms together toward the Buddha, and said, “World-honored One, how does $a renunciant abide by the Dharma of a renunciant?” $The World-honored One said: $Dhammika, long ago the human life span was eighty thousand years. 
$Dhammika, when the human life span was eighty thousand years, this $continent of Jambudīpa was very wealthy and pleasant, with many inhab￾itants; villages and cities were as close [together] as the distance of the $flight of a single rooster. 
Dhammika, when the human life span was eighty $thousand years, women married at the age of five hundred years. 
$Dhammika, when the human life span was eighty thousand years, there $were [only] such ailments as [needing to] defecate and urinate, having $desires, having nothing to eat, and growing old. 
Dhammika, when the $human life span was eighty thousand years, there was a king called $Koravya, a wheel-turning monarch, intelligent and wise, equipped with $a fourfold army to reign over the entire world. 
Being a righteous Dharma $king, he possessed the seven treasures. 
Those seven treasures are: the $wheel treasure, the elephant treasure, the horse treasure, the jewel treasure, $the woman treasure, the steward treasure, and the counselor treasure—$these are the seven. 
He had a thousand sons who were handsome, brave, $fearless, and able to overcome other people. 
He certainly ruled over the $whole earth, as far as the ocean, without relying on sword or club, gov￾erning only by the Dharma, bringing peace and happiness [to all].423$Dhammika, King Koravya had a tree called Well-established, a royal $banyan tree. 
Dhammika, the royal banyan tree Well-established had five $branches: the first branch provided nourishment for the king and queen; $397^taisho619a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$the second one provided nourishment for the crown prince and courtiers; $the third one provided nourishment for the countrymen; the fourth one $provided nourishment for renunciants and brahmins; the fifth one provided $nourishment for birds and beasts. 
Dhammika, the fruits of the royal banyan $tree Well-established were as big as a two-pint bottle, and tasted like pure $honeyballs. 
$Dhammika, the royal banyan tree Well-established was not guarded, $[yet] no one stole from it. 
[Then one day] a man came, hungry and thirsty, $very weak, with a wan and sallow appearance, wanting to eat the fruit, $so he approached the royal banyan tree Well-established. 
After having $eaten his fill of fruit he broke off a branch bearing fruit and left. 
$There was a deva who dwelled in dependence on the royal banyan tree $Well-established. 
He thought, “How odd is this man of Jambudīpa! He $lacks gratitude and appreciation. 
Why is that? Because, having eaten his $fill of fruit from the royal banyan tree Well-established, he broke off a $branch bearing fruit and took it away. 
Let me cause the royal banyan tree $Well-established to become devoid of fruit and not bear [any more] fruit.” $Then the royal banyan tree Well-established became devoid of fruit and $did not bear [any more] fruit. 
$Another man came by, hungry and thirsty, very weak, with wan and $sallow appearance, wanting to eat the fruit, so he approached the royal $banyan tree Well-established. 
Seeing that the royal banyan tree Well￾established had become devoid of fruit and was not producing [any more] $fruit, he approached King Koravya and said, “May your majesty know $that the royal banyan tree Well-established has become devoid of fruit $and is not producing [any more] fruit.”424$On hearing this, just as [quickly as the time it takes for] a strong man $to bend his arm or stretch it out, King Koravya disappeared from Kuru $[country] and arrived in the Heaven of the Thirty-three. 
Standing before $Sakka, ruler of the devas, he said, “May Kosiya know that the royal banyan $tree Well-established has become devoid of fruit and does not produce $[any more] fruit.” $Then, just as [quickly as the time it takes for] a strong man to bend his $arm or stretch it out, Sakka, ruler of the devas, and King Koravya disap￾peared from the Heaven of the Thirty-three and arrived in Kuru [country]. 
$398^taisho619b Division 11$Standing not far from the royal banyan tree Well-established, Sakka, ruler $of the devas, performed a feat of supernormal powers to create a great $rainstorm. 
After he had created the great rainstorm, the royal banyan tree $Well-established was uprooted and fell over. 
$Because of this, the tree deva who dwelled in the royal banyan tree $Well-established was sorrowful and distressed. 
Weeping and shedding $tears, he stood before Sakka, ruler of the devas. 
Sakka, ruler of the devas, $asked him, “Deva, why are you sorrowful and distressed, standing before $me weeping and shedding tears?” $The deva said, “May Kosiya know that, because of the great rainstorm $the royal banyan tree Well-established has been uprooted and fell over.” $Then Sakka, ruler of the devas, said to the tree deva, “Tree deva, when $the royal banyan tree Well-established was uprooted and fell over due to $the great rainstorm, did you abide by the Dharma of a tree deva?” $The tree deva said, “Kosiya, how does a tree deva abide by the Dharma $of a tree deva?” Sakka, ruler of the devas, told him: “Deva, suppose that $someone wants to dig up the roots of a tree and take them away; suppose $that he wants to cut the stem of the tree, the branches of the tree, the leaves $of the tree, the flowers of the tree, the fruits of the tree, and take them $away. 
The tree deva should not become angry, should not dislike him for $it; he should not harbor hatred in his heart. 
The tree deva should abandon $such states of mind and [just] dwell there as a tree deva. 
This is how a $tree deva abides by the Dharma of a tree deva.” $The deva said further, “Kosiya, I am a tree deva who did not abide by $the Dharma of a tree deva. 
From now on, being a tree deva, I will abide $by the Dharma of a tree deva. 
May the royal banyan tree Well-established $recover and be as it was before!” $Then Sakka, ruler of the devas, employed his supernormal powers to $again create a great rainstorm. 
After he had created the great rainstorm, $the royal banyan tree Well-established recovered and was as before. 
$It is the same, Dhammika, with a monk. 
He does not berate someone $who berates him; he does not become angry with someone who becomes $angry with him; he does not injure someone who injures him; and he does $not beat someone who beats him. 
In this way, Dhammika, a renunciant $abides by the Dharma of a renunciant. 
$399$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Then Venerable Dhammika rose from his seat, arranged his robe so as to $bare one shoulder, extended his hands with palms together toward the Buddha, $and, weeping and shedding tears, said: $World-honored One, I am a renunciant who did not abide by the Dharma $of a renunciant. 
From now on, being a renunciant, I will abide by the $Dharma of a renunciant. 
$The World-honored One said: $Dhammika, long ago there was a great teacher called Sunetta, a leader of $heterodox seers, who had abandoned sensual desire and [sensual] craving $and had acquired supernormal powers. 
Dhammika, the great teacher $Sunetta had countless hundreds and thousands of disciples. 
Dhammika, $the great teacher Sunetta taught his disciples the method for [attaining] $the Brahmā world. 
$Dhammika, when the great teacher Sunetta taught [his disciples] the $method for [attaining] the Brahmā world, some of the disciples who did $not completely accept and practice his method were reborn after death $into the Heaven of the Four Kings, some were reborn into the Heaven of $the Thirty-three, some were reborn into the Yāma Heaven, some were $reborn into the Tusita Heaven, some were reborn into the Heaven of Those $Who Delight in Creating, and some were reborn into the Heaven of Those $Who Delight in the Creations of Others.425$Dhammika, when the great teacher Sunetta taught [his disciples] the $method for [attaining] the Brahmā world, those disciples who completely $accepted and practiced his method developed the four divine abodes and $abandoned sensual desire, and after death they attained rebirth into the $Brahmā world. 
Then, Dhammika, the great teacher Sunetta thought, “It $is not proper for me to be on the same level in the next life as my disciples $by being reborn in the same place. 
Let me now instead practice a more $developed form of loving-kindness. 
After practicing this more developed $form of loving-kindness, after death I will attain rebirth into the Heaven $of Streaming Radiance (Ābhassara).” $Dhammika, at a later time the great teacher Sunetta practiced a more $developed form of loving-kindness. 
Having practiced that more developed $400^taisho619c Division 11$form of loving-kindness, after death he attained rebirth into the Heaven $of Streaming Radiance. 
Dhammika, the path of practice of the great teacher $Sunetta and his disciples was not in vain. 
It yielded great fruits. 
$Just like the great teacher Sunetta, so too were [six other great teachers]: $Mūgapakkha, the brahmin Aranemi, the teacher Kuddālaka, the young $brahmin Hatthipāla, Jotipāla, [and his father] Govinda: these were the $“seven [brahmin] chaplains” (satta purohita).426$Dhammika, these seven chaplains and teachers also had countless hun￾dreds and thousands of disciples. 
Dhammika, these seven chaplains and $teachers taught their disciples the method for [attaining] the Brahmā world. 
$When the seven chaplains and teachers taught [their disciples] the method $for [attaining] the Brahmā world, some of the disciples who did not com￾pletely accept and practice his method were reborn after death into the $Heaven of the Four Kings, some were reborn into the Heaven of the Thirty￾three, some were reborn into the Yāma Heaven, some were reborn into $Tusita Heaven, some were reborn into the Heaven of Those Who Delight $in Creating, and some were reborn into the Heaven of Those Who Delight $in the Creations of Others. 
$When the seven chaplains and teachers taught [their disciples] the $method for [attaining] the Brahmā world, those disciples who completely $accepted and practiced his method developed the four divine abodes and $abandoned sensual desire, and after death they attained rebirth into the $Brahmā world. 
Dhammika, then [each of] the seven chaplains and teachers $thought, “It is not proper that I, in the next life, should be on the same $level as my disciples by being reborn in the same place. 
Let me instead $practice a more developed kind of loving-kindness. 
After practicing that $more developed kind of loving-kindness, after death I will attain rebirth $into the Heaven of Streaming Radiance.” $Dhammika, then subsequently the seven chaplains and teachers prac￾ticed a more developed form of loving-kindness. 
Having practiced that $more developed form of loving-kindness, after death they attained rebirth $into the Heaven of Streaming Radiance. 
Dhammika, the path of practice $of the seven chaplains and teachers and [their] disciples was not in vain. 
$It yielded great fruits. 
$401^taisho620a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Dhammika, if anyone had berated those seven teachers and their retinue $of countless hundreds and thousands, if anyone had beaten them, become $angry with them, or condemned them, then that person would certainly $have been committing an immeasurably serious offense. 
$As for a disciple of the Buddha who has achieved right view, a monk $who has attained [such] a lesser fruit, if anyone were to berate him, beat $him, become angry with him, or condemn him, that person would be com￾mitting an even more serious offense. 
Therefore, Dhammika, you [and $your fellow monks] should protect one another. 
Why is that? After you $have abandoned this fault there will be no further loss [for you]. 
$Thereupon the World-honored One uttered these verses: $Sunetta, Mūgapakkha, $The brahmin Aranemi, $The teacher Kuddālaka, $The young brahmin Hatthipāla, $Jotipāla, and [his father] Govinda— $[These were] the seven chaplains. 
$In the past $These seven teachers were renowned for their virtue, $Free of the bond of [sensual] craving, delighting in compassion, $And with the fetter of sensual desire completely transcended. 
$They had disciples, $Countless hundreds and thousands of them, $Who had also abandoned the fetter of sensual desire, $But only momentarily, not yet totally. 
$In the case of those heterodox seers, $Who protected themselves well when practicing asceticism, $Anyone who with hatred and jealousy in his mind $Derided them, would have been committing a serious offense. 
$In the case of a disciple of the Buddha who has attained right view, $Who is established in a lesser fruit, $402$Division 11$Anyone who might deride, condemn, or attack him $Would be committing an even more serious offense. 
$Therefore, Dhammika, $You [and your fellow monks] should protect one another. 
$You should protect one another because $There is no offense more serious than this. 
$[It causes] suffering so severe $That the noble ones abhor it. 
$One will certainly receive disapproving looks $If he flagrantly adopts this position based on wrong view. 
$One who is the lowest grade of person, $As explained in the noble Dharma, $Namely one who has not yet abandoned sensual passion, $Has acquired to a very small degree the five faculties:427$Faith, energy, the establishment of mindfulness, $Right concentration, and right insight. 
$One who [derides, condemns, or attacks someone] like this will $ receive this suffering: $Facing the experience of one’s own ruin. 
$One will experience one’s own ruin $After harming others. 
$[But] if one can protect oneself, $One can then protect others. 
$Therefore, one should protect oneself; $[In this way] the wise [achieve] lasting happiness. 
$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, Venerable $Dhammika and the [other] monks were delighted and received it respectfully.

^ck The Discourse on $Overcoming Māra428$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying in Bhagga country, $at Mount Crocodile (Suṃsumāragiri) in the Fearsome Grove, the Deer Park. 
$403^taisho620b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$At that time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, who was supervising the con￾struction of a meditation hut for the Buddha,429 was walking back and forth $out in the open. 
Then King Māra, transforming himself into a miniature form, $entered Venerable Mahāmoggallāna’s belly. 
Venerable Mahāmoggallāna $thought, “Right now my belly feels as if I had just eaten beans. 
Let me enter $the appropriate meditative concentration, such that through that appropriate $meditative concentration I can observe my own belly.” $Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna walked to the end of the walking path, $spread his sitting mat, sat down on it cross-legged, and entered the appropriate $meditative concentration. 
Observing his own belly through the appropriate $meditative concentration, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna knew that King Māra $was inside his belly. 
$Venerable Mahāmoggallāna rose from meditative concentration and told $King Māra: $Evil One, come out! Evil One, come out! Do not harass the Tathāgata, and $do not harass a disciple of the Tathāgata! Do not [cause yourself] lack of $prosperity and lack of benefit for a long time and the certainty of being reborn $into a bad realm of existence and experiencing immeasurable suffering! $Then King Māra thought, “This renunciant does not see and know me $when he says: ‘Evil One, come out! Evil One, come out! Do not harass the $Tathāgata, and do not harass a disciple of the Tathāgata! Do not [cause your￾self] lack of prosperity and lack of benefit for a long time and the certainty $of being reborn into a bad realm of existence and of experiencing immeas￾urable suffering!’ Your venerable teacher is endowed with great supernormal $power, great and mighty virtue, great merit, great and mighty power, yet $even he cannot see and know me so quickly. 
How, then, would his disciple $be able to see and know me?” $Venerable Mahāmoggallāna further told King Māra: $I also know your mind. 
You are thinking this: “This renunciant does not $see and know me when he says, ‘Evil One, come out! Evil One, come $out! Do not harass the Tathāgata, and do not harass a disciple of the Tathā-$gata! Do not [cause yourself] lack of prosperity and lack of benefit for a $404^taisho620c Division 11$long time and the certainty of being reborn into a bad realm of existence $and of experiencing immeasurable suffering!’ Your venerable teacher is $endowed with great supernormal power, great and mighty virtue, great $merit, great and mighty power, yet even he cannot see and know me so $quickly. 
How, then, would his disciple be able to see and know me?” $Then Māra the Evil One thought again, “It is because this renunciant has $seen and known me that he now says this.” Thereupon Māra, the Evil One, $transforming himself into a miniature form, emerged from Venerable Mahā-$moggallāna’s mouth and stood before him. 
$Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said: $Evil One, long ago there was a tathāgata, free from attachment and fully $awakened, named Kakusandha. 
At that time I was a māra named Corrupter $(Dūsī), and I had a sister named Black (Kālī). 
You were her son, Evil One. 
$Therefore, you were my nephew. 
$Evil One, Kakusandha Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awak￾ened, had two chief disciples, one named Voice and the other named Per￾ception. 
Evil One, for what reason was Venerable Voice named “Voice”? $Evil One, Venerable Voice, when dwelling in the Brahmā world, often $caused his voice to pervade a thousand worlds. 
No other disciple had a $voice equal to his, similar to his, or surpassing his. 
Evil One, it was because $of this that Venerable Voice was named “Voice.”430$Again, Evil One, for what reason was Venerable Perception named $“Perception”? Evil One, Venerable Perception used to live in dependence $on a village or town. 
When the night was over, at dawn he would put on $his robes, take his bowl, and go into the village to beg for almsfood, well $guarded as to his bodily [movements], well restrained as to his sense fac￾ulties, and established in right mindfulness. 
Having begged almsfood and $after having partaken of the midday meal, he would put away his robe $and bowl and wash his hands and feet. 
Then he would put his sitting mat $over his shoulder and go to a forest, a mountain, the base of a tree, or $some [other] secluded place. 
He would spread out his sitting mat, sit down $on it cross-legged, and quickly enter the meditative concentration of the $cessation of perception and knowing. 
$405$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Then [it happened that] some cowherds, shepherds, woodsmen, and $passersby entered the forest. 
Seeing him in the meditative concentration $of the cessation of perception and knowing, they thought, “Now, this $renunciant has died while sitting in the forest. 
Let us gather dry wood and $grass, pile it up to cover his body, and cremate it.” So they gathered wood $and grass, piled it up to cover his body, set fire to it, and departed. 
$When the night was over, at dawn, Venerable Perception rose from his $meditative concentration, shook his robes [to remove the ashes], and went $to the village or town on which he depended. 
Wearing his robes and car￾rying his bowl as usual, he entered the village to beg for almsfood, well $guarded as to his bodily [movements], well restrained as to his sense fac￾ulties, and established in right mindfulness. 
$The cowherds, shepherds, woodsmen, or passersby who had earlier $entered the forest and seen him, who had thought, “Now, this renunciant $has died while sitting in the forest,” [now thought,] “Yesterday we gathered $dry wood and grass, piled it up to cover his body, set fire to it, and then $left. 
Yet this venerable one has recovered his perception.” Evil One, it is $for this reason that Venerable Perception was named “Perception.”431$Evil One, at that time the māra [named] Corrupter thought, “These $shaven-headed renunciants are bound by [their own] darkness, their lineage $is severed since they are without sons;432 when practicing meditation, they $muse, increasingly muse, and keep on musing, over and over. 
$“They are just like a donkey that has been carrying a heavy burden all $day long and, on being tied up in the stable but not yet fed his wheat, $muses about that wheat, increasingly muses, and keeps on musing over $and over. 
In the same way, these shaven-headed renunciants are bound $by [their own] darkness, their lineage is severed since they are without $sons; when practicing meditation, they muse, increasingly muse, and keep $on musing, over and over. 
$“They are just like a cat waiting beside a mouse hole, wanting to catch $the mouse; because of that, it muses, increasingly muses, and keeps musing $again and again. 
In the same way, these shaven-headed renunciants are $bound by [their own] darkness, their lineage is severed since they are $without sons; when practicing meditation, they muse, increasingly muse, $and keep on musing, over and over. 
$406^taisho621a Division 11$“They are just like an owl or a fox that waits by a crevice in a pile of $dry firewood because it wants to catch a mouse; because of that, it muses, $increasingly muses, and keeps on musing over and over. 
In the same way, $these shaven-headed renunciants are bound by [their own] darkness, their $lineage is severed since they are without sons; when practicing meditation, $they muse, increasingly muse, and keep on musing, over and over. 
$“They are just like a crane waiting on a riverbank because it wants to $catch a fish; because of that, it muses, increasingly muses, and keeps on $musing, over and over. 
In the same way, these shaven-headed renunciants $are bound by [their own] darkness, their lineage is severed since they are $without sons; when practicing meditation, they muse, increasingly muse, $and keep on musing, over and over. 
$“What do they muse about? For what benefit do they muse? What are $they seeking through musing? They are confused, crazy, and ruined. 
I do $not know where they come from, where they are going to, or where they $are staying. 
I do not know about their death or their rebirth. 
Let me incite $the brahmin householders, ‘Come on, all of you! Revile the diligent renun￾ciants! Beat them up and rebuke them!’ Why is this? Perhaps when [the $renunciants] are reviled, beaten up, and rebuked it may stir up some $unwholesome state of mind in them. 
Then I will get an opportunity.” $Evil One, when the māra [named] Corrupter incited the brahmin house￾holders [in this way], the brahmin householders reviled, beat up, and $rebuked the diligent renunciants. 
Some brahmin householders beat them $with pieces of wood, some threw stones at them, some struck them with $sticks, some injured the diligent renunciants’ heads, some tore their robes, $and some broke their almsbowls.433$Then, because of this, conditioned by this, when those brahmin house￾holders died, at the breaking up of the body at death, they certainly went $to a bad realm, being reborn in hell. 
Having been reborn there, they thought, $“We deserve to experience this suffering, and we will experience suffering $more extreme than this. 
Why is that? Because we performed evil deeds $toward diligent renunciants.” $Evil One, the disciples of Kakusandha Tathāgata, free from attachment $and fully awakened, having had their heads injured, their robes torn, and $407^taisho621b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$their almsbowls broken, approached Kakusandha Tathāgata, free from $attachment and fully awakened. 
$At that time Kakusandha Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully $awakened, was surrounded by a retinue of countless hundreds and thou￾sands to whom he was teaching the Dharma.434 Kakusandha Tathāgata, $free from attachment and fully awakened, saw from afar that his disciples $with their heads injured, their robes torn, and their almsbowls broken, $were approaching. 
Seeing this, he addressed the monks, “Do you see that? $The māra [named] Corrupter has incited brahmin householders: ‘Come $on, all of you! Revile the diligent renunciants! Beat them up and rebuke $them!’ Why is that? [Because he thought,] ‘Perhaps, when they are reviled, $beaten up, and rebuked, that may stir up some unwholesome state of mind $in them. 
Then I will get an opportunity.’ $“Monks, you should dwell with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, $mentally pervading one direction, likewise the second, the third, and the $fourth directions—all four directions and also the four intermediate directions, $above and below, all around, everywhere. 
Dwell with a mind imbued with $loving-kindness—without bondage, resentment, ill-will, and contention—$[with a mind] that has become boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well $developed, having pervaded the entire world. 
Dwell like this, having pervaded $the entire world with a mind imbued with compassion ...
with empathetic $joy ...
with equanimity, without bondage, resentment, ill-will, and con￾tention—[with a mind] that has become boundless, exalted, immeasurable, $and well developed. 
Let the māra [named] Corrupter who seeks to get an $opportunity be unable to get an opportunity.” $Evil One, [when] Kakusandha Tathāgata, free from attachment and $fully awakened, taught his disciples this teaching and they had received $this teaching, they dwelled mentally pervading one direction with a mind $imbued with loving-kindness, likewise the second, the third, and the $fourth directions—all four directions and also the four intermediate direc￾tions, above and below, all around, everywhere. 
They dwelled with a $mind imbued with loving-kindness—without bondage, resentment, ill￾will, and contention—[with a mind] that had become boundless, exalted, $immeasurable, and well developed, having pervaded the entire world. 
$They dwelled like this having pervaded the entire world with a mind $408$Division 11$imbued with compassion ...
with empathetic joy ...
with equanimity, $without bondage, resentment, ill-will, and contention—[with a mind] that $had become boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well developed. 
For $this reason, the māra [named] Corrupter who was seeking to get an oppor￾tunity was unable to get an opportunity. 
$Evil One, at that time the māra [named] Corrupter thought, “I am unable $to get an opportunity with the diligent renunciants in this way. 
Let me now $instead urge the brahmin householders, ‘Come on, all of you. 
Respect, $revere, and serve the diligent renunciants!’ Perhaps, when the diligent $renunciants are respected, revered, and served that may stir up some $unwholesome state of mind in them. 
Then I will get an opportunity.” $Evil One, having been urged [thus] by the māra [named] Corrupter, $all the brahmin householders respected, revered, and served the diligent 621c renunciants.435 [They] spread their clothes on the ground and said, “Diligent $renunciants, please walk on this. 
The diligent renunciants practice what $is difficult to practice. 
Grant us long-lasting benefit and gain, peace and $happiness [by stepping on these clothes]!” $The brahmin householders spread their hair on the ground and said, $“Diligent renunciants, please walk on this. 
The diligent renunciants practice $what is difficult to practice. 
Grant us long-lasting benefit and gain, peace $and happiness [by stepping on this hair]!” $The brahmin householders, holding various kinds of food and drink $in their hands, stood waiting by the roadside, saying, “Diligent renunciants, $accept this, eat this, take it with you and use it as you wish. 
Grant us long￾lasting benefit and gain, peace and happiness!” $The faithful brahmin householders, seeing the diligent renunciants, $respectfully took them by the arm, led them inside [their houses] and, $holding up various valuable objects, said to the diligent renunciants, $“Accept this! Take it with you and use it as you wish!” $Then because of this, conditioned by this, when those brahmin house￾holders died at the breaking up of the body at death, they certainly went $to a good realm of existence, being reborn in a heavenly world. 
Having $been reborn there, they thought, “We deserve to experience this happiness, $and we will experience even more extreme happiness. 
Why is that? Because $we performed good deeds toward the diligent renunciants.” $409$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Evil One, the disciples of Kakusandha Tathāgata, free from attachment $and fully awakened, having been respected, revered, and served, $approached Kakusandha Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awak￾ened. 
At that time Kakusandha Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully $awakened, was surrounded by a retinue of countless hundreds and thou￾sands to whom he was teaching the Dharma. 
$Kakusandha Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened, saw $from afar that his disciples, who had been respected, revered, and served, $were approaching. 
Seeing this, he addressed the monks, “Did you see $that? The māra [named] Corrupter urged the brahmin householders, ‘Come $on, all of you! Respect, revere, and serve the diligent renunciants!’ [He $thought,] ‘Perhaps, when the diligent renunciants are respected, revered, $and served, it may stir up some unwholesome state of mind in them, and $then I will get an opportunity.’ $“Monks, you should contemplate all formations as impermanent, con￾template them as of a nature to rise and fall, contemplate dispassion, con￾template abandoning, contemplate cessation, and contemplate elimina￾tion.436 Let the māra [named] Corrupter, who seeks to get an opportunity, $be unable to get an opportunity.” $Evil One, when Kakusandha Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully $awakened, taught his disciples this teaching and they had received the $teaching, they contemplated all formations as impermanent, they contem￾plated them as of a nature to rise and fall, they contemplated dispassion, $they contemplated abandoning, they contemplated cessation, and they $contemplated elimination, so that the māra [named] Corrupter, who was $seeking to get an opportunity, was unable to get an opportunity. 
$Evil One, at that time the māra [named] Corrupter thought, “I am $unable to get an opportunity with the diligent renunciants in this way. 
Let $me instead transform myself into a young man and, holding a large stick $in my hand and standing by the roadside, I will hit Venerable Voice on $the head so that [his head] is cut and blood runs down his face.”437$Evil One, at dawn Kakusandha Tathāgata, free from attachment and $fully awakened, who was living in dependence on a village or town, put $on his robes, took his bowl, and entered the village to beg for almsfood. 
$Venerable Voice followed behind him as his attendant. 
$410^taisho622a Division 11$Evil One, at that time the māra [named] Corrupter, having transformed $himself into a young man, was holding a large stick in his hand and standing $by the roadside. 
He hit Venerable Voice on the head, cutting it, and blood $ran down his face. 
Evil One, Venerable Voice, with his head cut and blood $running down his face, followed behind Kakusandha Tathāgata, free from $attachment and fully awakened, like a shadow that never left him. 
$Evil One, Kakusandha Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awak￾ened, having reached the village, turned his whole body around to the $right to look, in the way a nāga looks around, observing in all directions $without fear or trepidation. 
$Evil One, Kakusandha Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awak￾ened, saw that Venerable Voice, with his head cut and blood running down $his face, was following behind the Buddha like a shadow that never left $him. 
Then he said, “The māra [named] Corrupter is vicious and violent $and possesses great power. 
This māra [named] Corrupter does not know $how much is enough.” $Evil One, before Kakusandha Tathāgata, free from attachment and $fully awakened, had finished speaking, at that time the body of the māra$[named] Corrupter straightaway fell from that place into the Great Hell $Without Omission. 
$Evil One, this Great Hell has four designations. 
The first is “Without $Omission,” the second is “Hundred Nails,” the third is “Barbed Spikes,” $and the fourth is “Six Contacts.”438 In the Great Hell there are wardens $who approached the māra [named] Corrupter. 
They told the māra [named] $Corrupter, “Now, you should know that when nail and nail meet each $other, a full hundred years have passed.” $Hearing this, Māra, the Evil One, experienced palpitations of the heart $due to fear and terror, and all his bodily hair stood on end. 
He addressed Ven￾erable Mahāmoggallāna in verse: $Which hell was it $Into which the māra [named] Corrupter fell long ago, $He who troubled and harmed practitioners of the Buddha’s holy life $And offended against the monks? $411$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Venerable Mahāmoggallāna answered Māra, the Evil One, in verse:439$Without Omission is the name of the hell $In which the māra [named] Corrupter formerly [fell], $[When he] troubled and harmed practitioners of the Buddha’s holy life $And offended against the monks. 
$It contains a hundred iron nails, $Each of them with barbed spikes. 
$Without Omission is the name of the hell $That the māra [named] Corrupter was in long ago. 
$Those who do not understand $The [consequences of attacking] monks who are the Buddha’s disciples $Will certainly suffer like this, $Experiencing the results of their black deeds. 
$There are various kinds of pleasure parks, $For human beings on the earth $Who eat naturally grown white rice $[While] dwelling in the northern continent (Uttarakuru), $On the peak of the great Mount Sumeru $I cultivated [my mind] well and burned up [all defilements]. 
$Having cultivated there and [attained] liberation, $I [now] bear my last body. 
$Located by a great spring $Is a palace that will last for the [entire] eon, $Of delightful golden color, $And radiant like a flame. 
$Various kinds of music are performed $As [one] approaches the [dwelling] place of Sakka, $His single residence, which in the past, $As is well known, had been offered to him. 
$With Sakka walking ahead of me $I ascended to the Vejayanta Palace. 
$412^taisho622b Division 11$On seeing Sakka, each heavenly nymph $Began dancing with great joy. 
$On seeing that a monk was coming, $They withdrew in shame. 
$On reaching the Vejayanta Palace, $And seeing the monk, [Sakka] asked him a question, $“Does the great seer know $The end of craving and the attainment of liberation?” $The monk replied $According to the inquirer’s question, $“Kosiya, I do know $The end of craving and the attainment of liberation.” $On hearing his answer $Sakka gained joy and happiness. 
$[He said,] “The monk benefits [me] greatly; $What he has said is in accordance with my question.” $After reaching the Vejayanta Palace, $[The monk] asked Sakka, ruler of the devas, $“What is the name of this palace, $Sakka, in the city you rule?” $Sakka answered, “Great Seer, $It is called Vejayanta, $Which means ‘a thousand worlds $Among a thousand worlds.’ $Nothing surpasses or [even] resembles $This palace Vejayanta.” $[There] the Heavenly King, Sakka, ruler of the devas, $Can dwell at ease as he pleases. 
$He enjoys a myriad pleasures, $By transforming one [pleasure] into a hundred. 
$In the Vejayanta Palace $Sakka is able to dwell at ease. 
$413^taisho622c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume II$Great though the Vejayanta Palace is, $I was able to shake it with my toe, $As the Heavenly King saw with his own eyes. 
$Yet Sakka is [still] able to dwell [in it] at ease. 
$For, like the Hall of Migāra’s Mother, $Its foundations are built extremely deep and solid. 
$It is difficult to move and shake, $[Yet] supernormal power can shake it. 
$It has colored glaze floors $Upon which noble ones have trodden. 
$Smooth and glossy, lovely to touch, $Spread with soft cotton covers. 
$With loving speech and harmonious company, $The Heavenly King is always happy. 
$He is skilled in playing music $With harmonious tone and melody. 
$When a stream-enterer speaks $All the devas come and assemble,440$Countless thousands $And hundreds of myriads of them. 
$Having gone to the Heaven of the Thirty-three, $The one endowed with the eye of wisdom taught them the Dharma. 
$Having heard his teaching, $[The devas] were delighted and received it respectfully. 
$I too have this quality, $As the seers say. 
$I went up to the Brahmā world $And asked Brahmā, $“Brahmā, do you [still] have this view, $Namely the view: ‘I existed in the distant past, $And I still exist, and I always will exist, $Eternal and unchanging’?” $414$Division 11$Brahmā answered, $“Great seer, I no longer have that view, $Namely the view: ‘I existed in the distant past, $I am eternal and unchanging.’ $[Instead] I see that all Brahmās $In this realm will pass away. 
$How could I now say $That I am eternal and unchanging? $“I see that this world $Is just as the Fully Awakened One has taught. 
$It has arisen in accordance with causes and conditions, $And will return to where it came from. 
$“Fire does not think: $‘I will burn the ignorant one.’ $When a fire is burning, if an ignorant one touches it, $Naturally he is certain to be burned. 
$“In the same way, Evil One, $If you harass a tathāgata, $And engage in unwholesome conduct for a long time, $You will experience the [bad] results for a long time. 
$“Evil One, do not dislike the Buddha! $Do not trouble or harm monks! $There is a monk who overcomes Māra $Dwelling in the Fearsome Grove.” $The Evil One was worried and grieved, $After being reprimanded by Moggallāna. 
$Frightened and lacking wisdom, $He immediately disappeared from that place. 
$Thus spoke Venerable Mahāmoggallāna. 
Having heard what Venerable $Mahāmoggallāna said, Māra the Evil One was delighted and received it $respectfully. 
$415^taisho623a Notes$Division 7 $1 The Pāli parallel is the Upakkilesa-sutta, MN 128 at MN III 152 (see also Mv 10.2 $at Vin I 342); for a comparative study see Bhikkhu Anālayo, A Comparative Study $of the Majjhima-nikāya (Taipei: Dharma Drum Publishing Corporation, 2011), pp. 
$731–741. 
Here and elsewhere, further information on previously published comparative $studies can be found in this source. 
$2 In the Pāli parallels a monk informs the Buddha of what is happening. 
The ensuing $tale of the king of Kosala is found only in the Vinaya, not in the Upakkilesa-sutta. 
$3 In the Pāli Vinaya version King Dīghīti of Kosala immediately flees when King $Brahma datta of Kāsi attacks for the first time, as he feels unable to resist the attack. 
$4 The Pāli Vinaya version does not report that King Dīghīti of Kosala took to performing $music and in this way came to live with the brahmin chaplain. 
$5 In the Pāli Vinaya version Dīghīti directly approaches the brahmin chaplain and relates $his wife’s request. 
$6 The Pāli Vinaya version does not describe the prince’s training but reports that he was $sent to live outside the town, out of caution regarding King Brahmadatta. 
$7 According to the Pāli Vinaya version, the barber of King Dīghīti had happened to see $his former master and then told King Brahmadatta. 
$8 In the Pāli Vinaya version King Brahmadatta immediately orders the execution of $Dīghīti and his wife. 
Their son happens to visit the town just at that time and sees $them being paraded through the streets. 
$9 According to the Pāli Vinaya version, King Dīghīti and his wife had been executed, $and it was their son who took care of their bodily remains. 
$10 In the Pāli Vinaya version, the son has found work in an elephant stable. 
He is overheard $by King Brahmadatta singing and playing a lute in the stable, and the king subsequently $sends for him. 
$11 In the Pāli Vinaya version at this point Prince Long Life again draws his sword, holds $it to King Brahmadatta’s throat, and recounts the harm done by the king to his parents. 
$12 In the Pāli Vinaya version they grant each other their lives. 
$417$Notes$13 In the Upakkilesa-sutta only one monk tells the Buddha three times to stay out of $their dispute. 
$14 A stanza in the Upakkilesa-sutta instead has, before the line about living alone like $an elephant, a line that describes a king who leaves behind a realm he has conquered. 
$This fits the context better and suggests that the idea of “governing sternly” could be $the result of some error in transmission or translation. 
$15 In the Upakkilesa-sutta the Buddha instead departs by walking away. 
$16 The Upakkilesa-sutta does not describe Bhagu’s practice. 
$17 In the Upakkilesa-sutta Bhagu reports only that he has no trouble getting food. 
$18 The Buddha’s sojourn in the Rakkhitavana Grove in the company of an elephant is $also recorded at Vin I 352, according to which this took place after he had visited $Anuruddha and his companions. 
$19 A comparable description is found in the Upakkilesa-sutta, but later, as part of a report $given by Anuruddha to the Buddha. 
$20 The corresponding description in the Upakkilesa-sutta does not refer to their practice $of meditation, and in relation to their regular meetings every five days mentions only $that they discuss the Dharma, not that they might alternatively sit together in silence. 
$21 The Upakkilesa-sutta does not report any reply by the Buddha to the warden; here $Anuruddha intervenes right away. 
$22 Adopting the variant 是, in accordance with the reading of this passage found in the $Abhidharmakośabhāṣya; see Prahlad Pradhan, Abhidharmakośabhāṣya of Vasubandhu $(Patna: K. 
P. 
Jayaswal Research Institute, 1967), p. 
300: yat tat loka nāsti. 
This spec￾ification, not found in the Upakkilesa-sutta, helps explain why doubt can arise, namely $because of unfamiliarity with the mental experience of an inner light (as the result $of deepening concentration). 
$23 身病, literally “bodily disease,” which might render an Indic original comparable to $the Pāli kāyaduṭṭhulla, hence the rendering “bodily inertia.” $24 The Upakkilesa-sutta illustrates excessive energy, the seventh upakkilesa in its listing, $with the example of grasping a quail so tightly that it will die; the same simile, but $with grasping the quail too loosely, then illustrates lack of energy. 
$25 The corresponding simile in the Upakkilesa-sutta describes searching for one entrance $to a treasure and finding five entrances. 
$26 Conceit is not mentioned in the Upakkilesa-sutta.$27 The Upakkilesa-sutta instead speaks of excessive meditation on forms. 
Whereas the $rest of the list, in spite of some variations in sequence, appears to be on the whole $similar, in the case of this last item in both lists the two versions stand in direct contrast $418$Notes to each other. 
The instruction in MĀ 72 makes it appear recommendable to contemplate $forms, but MN 128 warns against excessively contemplating forms. 
$28 These three types of concentration occur only at the end of the Upakkilesa-sutta as $part of a summary statement in which the Buddha describes his practice of concentration $with vitakka and vicāra, without vitakka but still with vicāra, and without either. 
$29 Here and below, the translation is based on an emendation, given in brackets. 
The $text speaks rather of “knowledge” of forms. 
Since otherwise the passage is about $“vision” of forms and “knowledge” of light, it seems probable that the formulation $here is the result of a textual error. 
$30 Instead of exclusive, diversified, limited, and vast concentrations, the Upakkilesa￾sutta mentions concentration with and without rapture, with enjoyment, and with $equanimity. 
$31 The Pāli parallel is the Gayā-sutta, AN 8.64 at AN IV 302, which has Gayāsīsa at $Gayā as its location. 
$32 According to the Gayā-sutta, the Buddha did perceive light, but did not see forms. 
$33 In the Gayā-sutta the item that follows being able to converse with the devas is $knowing which order (nikāya) of devas they belong to. 
$34 In the Gayā-sutta knowing the karma that led the devas to their rebirths precedes $knowing their pleasure or pain and knowing their life spans. 
$35 Recognition of individual devas is not mentioned in the Gayā-sutta.$36 The Pāli parallel is the Anuruddha-sutta, AN 8.30 at AN IV 228. 
$37 Instead of the ability to wander freely in the four directions, the Anuruddha-sutta compares the medicine made out of fermented cow’s urine to various medications $made of ghee, butter, oil, honey, and molasses. 
The Anuruddha-sutta also does not $report any prediction about increasing in wholesome states or attaining one of two $fruits; it instead directly continues with the Buddha’s advice that Anruddha should $spend the rainy season in the same place. 
$38 In the Anuruddha-sutta the Buddha addresses the monks immediately on his return, $without asking Ānanda to gather them. 
$39 The Anuruddha-sutta additionally mentions contentment with lodgings and medicine. 
$40 Instead of bodily and mental seclusion, the Anuruddha-sutta describes a detached $attitude toward visitors. 
$41 Instead of the four satipaṭṭhānas, the Anuruddha-sutta just mentions mindfulness of $the type that enables recalling what was said and done long ago. 
$42 The Anuruddha-sutta only mentions inclining the mind toward the extinction of pro￾liferation. 
$419$Notes$43 The Anuruddha-sutta specifies that the Buddha had come through his mind-made $body (manomayena kāyena). 
$44 The next two stanzas in MĀ 74 are not found in the Anuruddha-sutta; the last has a $counterpart in Th 919. 
$45 The Pāli parallel is the Āneñjasappāya-sutta, MN 106 at MN II 261; for comparative $studies see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
613–623; $Madhyama-āgama Studies, (Taipei: Dharma Drum Publishing Corporation, 2012), $pp. 
195–222. 
$46 Instead of sensual pleasures and material forms, the Āneñjasappāya-sutta takes up $sensual pleasures and sensual perceptions. 
$47 In addition to material forms, the Āneñjasappāya-sutta mentions sensual pleasures $and sensual perceptions. 
$48 In addition to the corresponding perceptions, the Āneñjasappāya-sutta also mentions $sensual pleasures and material forms; and it commends that the cessation of all these $is to be viewed as peaceful. 
$49 The translation is based on an emendation of the text. 
For the words given in angle $brackets (< >) the text instead has, in each case, “imperturbability.” The context shows $that these must be textual errors. 
$50 The second approach to nothingness in the Āneñjasappāya-sutta is just about being $empty of a self and of what belongs to a self, without an explicit mention of being $empty of permanence. 
$51 In the Āneñjasappāya-sutta the third approach to nothingness is to contemplate: “I $am not anything belonging to anyone anywhere,” etc. 
$52 According to the Āneñjasappāya-sutta, the cessation of all these perceptions is to be $viewed as peaceful. 
$53 In the Āneñjasappāya-sutta Ānanda highlights that the Buddha taught the crossing $of the flood in dependence on one support after another. 
$54 The Pāli parallels are the Bhikkhu-sutta, SN 47.3 at SN V 142, which has Jeta’s Grove $at Sāvatthī as its location, and the Saṅkhitta-sutta, AN 8.63 at AN IV 299, which does $not specify the location. 
$55 In the two Pāli versions, the Buddha first rebuffs the monk before giving an instruction. 
$56 The injunction to settle the mind within has a counterpart in the Saṅkhitta-sutta (where $this is followed by instructions on the brahmavihāras); practice of the four satipaṭṭhā-$nas internally and externally is described in the Bhikkhu-sutta (where it is preceded $by the need to purify morality and have straight view). 
$57 The implication of this expression is unclear; to judge from the Pāli parallels, it could $be a textual error. 
$420$Notes$58 The Saṅkhitta-sutta recommends cultivating concentration with vitakka and vicāra, $without vitakka but with a remainder of vicāra, without vitakka or vicāra, with rapture, $without rapture, with enjoyment, and with equanimity. 
$59 The Saṅkhitta-sutta takes up the brahmavihāras first and only afterward the four $satipaṭṭhānas (which are not explicitly shown to require internal and external prac￾tice), and in relation to both it enjoins that such concentration should be with vitakka and vicāra, without vitakka but with a remainder of vicāra, without vitakka or $vicāra, with rapture, without rapture, with enjoyment, and with equanimity. 
Only $in relation to the four satipaṭṭhānas does the Saṅkhitta-sutta mention being at ease $in any bodily posture. 
$60 Such a prediction of attainment is not found in the two Pāli parallels, although both $report that the monk who received the respective instructions, after practice in seclusion, $became an arahant. 
$61 The Pāli parallel is the Naḷakapāna-sutta, MN 68 at MN I 462, which has Naḷakapāna $in the Kosalan country as its location; for a comparative study, see Anālayo, A Com￾parative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
370–373. 
$62 In the Naḷakapāna-sutta the Buddha instead asks if they thought he practiced restraint $because he had not yet eradicated the taints. 
$63 According to the Naḷakapāna-sutta, it is because the Buddha has eradicated the taints $that he practices restraint. 
$64 The Buddha’s secluded lifestyle is not taken up in the Naḷakapāna-sutta.$65 The Pāli parallel is the Brahmanimantaṇika-sutta, MN 49 at MN I 326; for a compar￾ative study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
294–299. 
$66 According to the Brahmanimantaṇika-sutta, Māra had actually taken possession of $a member of the assembly. 
$67 The Brahmanimantaṇika-sutta does not report that Māra disappeared. 
$68 In the Brahmanimantaṇika-sutta the Buddha adds that Brahmā had previously passed $away from the Ābhassarā heavenly realm and in the meantime had forgotten about $it. 
$69 In the Brahmanimantaṇika-sutta the Buddha also refers to the nonmanifestative or $invisible consciousness, anidassana viññāṇa. 
$70 The text gives the impression that Brahmā is still the speaker. 
The Pāli editions differ $and only some mark the corresponding part as spoken by the Buddha; for a discussion $see Anālayo, “The Luminous Mind in Theravāda and Dharmaguptaka Discourses”, $Journal of the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies 13 (2017): 10–50. 
$71 According to the Brahmanimantaṇika-sutta, the Buddha spoke the stanza on seeing $fear in becoming while he had made himself invisible. 
$421$Notes$72 The reference to joining the assembly “up to three times” is not clear. 
According to $the earlier narration he had departed once, so for him to come back now would con￾stitute only a second joining of the assembly. 
$73 Instead of telling Māra to keep away from the topic of the Buddha’s teaching activities, $in the Brahmanimantaṇika-sutta the Buddha affirms his eradication of the taints, $comparing it to a palm tree that has been cut down. 
$74 The Pāli parallel is the Anuruddha-sutta, MN 127 at MN III 144; for a comparative $study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
726–731. 
$75 The protagonist in the Anuruddha-sutta is instead the householder Pañcakaṅga. 
$76 Adopting the variant 料 instead of 斷. 
$77 In the Anuruddha-sutta those who have taught him are instead elder monks, therā $bhikkhū. 
Similarly later in Anuruddha’s description, those who practice these liberations $are monks, not renunciants and brahmins. 
$78 The Anuruddha-sutta does not report a question-and-answer exchange at this juncture. 
$Another difference is that in the preceding part it first takes up the immeasurable and $then the exalted liberation of the mind. 
$79 Instead of these three, the Anuruddha-sutta distinguishes four types: devas of limited $radiance, immeasurable radiance, defiled radiance, and pure radiance. 
$80 The fly simile in the Anuruddha-sutta, where the fly is on a carrying pole or basket, $illustrates that the devas do not consider themselves to be permanent. 
$81 In the Anuruddha-sutta Kaccāna instead asks if the devas are all of limited radiance $or if some are rather of immeasurable radiance, and later on he asks the same question $for those of defiled and pure radiance. 
$82 The Anuruddha-sutta does not have a reference to the Buddha’s position on this matter. 
$83 The lotus simile is not found in the Anuruddha-sutta.$84 In the Anuruddha-sutta the simile of the impure oil lamp illustrates devas of defiled $radiance. 
$85 In the Anuruddha-sutta Kaccāna instead addresses Anuruddha, and apparently in a $discourteous way. 
$86 The Anuruddha-sutta reports neither the meal offering nor the delight of the audi￾ence. 
$87 Adopting the variant 墩 instead of 塹. 
$88 The Pāli parallel is the Kāyagatāsati-sutta, MN 119 at MN III 88, which has Jeta’s $Grove at Sāvatthī as its location; for a comparative study see Anālayo, A Comparative $Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
673–678. 
$422$Notes$89 The sequence of body contemplation in the Kāyagatāsati-sutta differs, proceeding $from mindfulness of breathing to bodily postures, bodily activities, anatomical parts, $elements, cemetery contemplations, and the four absorptions. 
$90 The Kāyagatāsati-sutta does not mention falling asleep or waking up as part of the $contemplation of bodily postures. 
$91 The Kāyagatāsati-sutta states that memories and intentions related to the household $life are abandoned and the mind becomes concentrated. 
$92 The Kāyagatāsati-sutta also mentions eating, drinking, consuming food, tasting, defe￾cating, and urinating. 
$93 This and the following exercise are not mentioned in the Kāyagatāsati-sutta.$94 Adopting the variant 絣 instead of 拼. 
$95 The translation is based on emending what in the original is a reference to “verbal $activities” when exhaling, clearly a textual error. 
$96 In the case of each of the four absorptions, the Kāyagatāsati-sutta also describes $the actual attainment of the corresponding absorption before depicting how it affects $the body. 
$97 The Kāyagatāsati-sutta does not give the size of the cloth, which it qualifies as $being white. 
$98 This and the following exercise are not mentioned in the Kāyagatāsati-sutta.$99 Guanxiang 觀相, which perhaps is equivalent to the paccavekkhaṇanimitta. 
$100 This list of seeds differs from the seeds in the same simile in MĀ 98, the parallel to $the Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta.$101 The Kāyagatāsati-sutta lists only the four elements of earth, water, fire, and wind. 
$102 Cremation or burial are not mentioned in the Kāyagatāsati-sutta.$103 In the Kāyagatāsati-sutta this and the following descriptions are rather about monks $who have or have not established mindfulness of the body. 
The Pāli version also has $a different sequence: it first has the three similes of throwing a ball, fire sticks, and $the water pot that illustrate lack of being established in mindfulness of the body, and $then their three counterparts that illustrate the presence of mindfulness of the body. 
$104 Adopting the variant 搏 instead of 闡. 
$105 The Kāyagatāsati-sutta has three more similes, which describe tilting a full water $jug, loosening the embankment of a pond full of water, and driving a chariot wherever $one wishes. 
$106 The Kāyagatāsati-sutta announces and lists ten benefits. 
It does not refer to not getting $423$Notes stuck in the three unwholesome thoughts, nor to attaining stream-entry, once-returning, $nonreturning, and the four immaterial attainments. 
$107 Adopting a variant that does not have a reference to this being also “the fifth, sixth $and seventh benefit,” 五六七. 
Since overcoming three types of unwholesome thought $cannot result in four benefits, the reference to the fifth, sixth, and seventh benefits $must be misplaced, probably belonging with the next item in the list. 
$108 Adopting a variant that adds 第五至. 
$109 Adopting a variant that speaks of “seven” instead of “one” existence. 
$110 Adopting a variant that only mentions the twelfth benefit at this point and accordingly $deleting a redundant passage on the eradication of the taints. 
$111 The Pāli parallel is the Hatthisāriputta-sutta, AN 6.60 at AN III 392, which has the $Isipatana at Vārāṇasī as its location. 
$112 The Hatthisāriputta-sutta mentions not just association with laypeople but associating $with other monastics, lay disciples, kings, and ministers, as well as non-Buddhist $practitioners and their disciples. 
$113 In the Hatthisāriputta-sutta the simile of no longer seeing animals in a lake illustrates $the effect of having attained the second absorption, whereas the simile of the dust at $a crossroads becoming mud after rain illustrates the effect of the first absorption. 
$114 Adopting a variant that reads 咸 instead of 滅. 
$115 In the Hatthisāriputta-sutta the simile of the lake without waves illustrates the effect $of having attained the fourth absorption, whereas the simile related to food illustrates $the third absorption. 
$116 The simile in the Hatthisāriputta-sutta depicts a person who has just finished a $delicious meal and is offered leftover food from the day before. 
$117 In the Hatthisāriputta-sutta Mahākoṭṭhita affirms that he knew the mind of Citta and $had also been informed about it by devas. 
The Pāli discourse continues by reporting $that Citta’s friends also informed the Buddha of Citta’s disrobing, who then predicted $that Citta would soon go forth again. 
This indeed happened, Citta went forth again $and eventually became an arahant. 
$118 The Pāli parallel is the Pacalāyamāna-sutta, which is the first part of AN 7.58 at AN $IV 85; the second part of this discourse in the PTS edition, beginning at AN IV 88, $is a different discourse which is rather a parallel to MĀ 138. 
$119 Instead of these three means related to the teachings—recitation, teaching others, and $reflection—the Pacalāyamāna-sutta only recommends two, reflection and recitation. 
$120 The Pacalāyamāna-sutta combines this and the preceding one into a single remedy of $washing the eyes with water and looking at the constellations. 
The next recommendation $424$Notes in the Pacalāyamāna-sutta is to cultivate ālokasaññā, “perception of light” (or “clarity $of perception”?), a method not mentioned in MĀ 83. 
$121 The Pacalāyamāna-sutta does not recommend resuming sitting meditation after $having done walking meditation. 
According to its presentation, if after doing walking $meditation one still feels tired, it is time to lie down and take a rest. 
$122 In total the Pacalāyamāna-sutta lists only eight recommendations: to avoid the per￾ception that has led to the drowsiness, to reflect on the teachings, to recite the teachings, $to pull on the earlobes, to rinse the eyes with water and look at the constellations, to $develop perception of light, to practice walking meditation, and to lie down. 
$123 After its list of methods to overcome drowsiness, the Pacalāyamāna-sutta warns $against pride when begging alms, engaging in contentious talk, and being bound to $monastics or laypeople. 
$124 In the Pacalāyamāna-sutta the Buddha introduces this instruction with the dictum $that “nothing in the world is worth adhering to.” $125 The Pāli parallel is the Kaṇṭaka-sutta, AN 10.72 at AN V 133, which has as its location $the Gabled Hall in the Great Wood at the same location, Vesālī. 
$126 The reconstruction of the last four of these six names is only tentative. 
$127 The Kaṇṭaka-sutta does not report the actual visit by the Licchavis. 
$128 The Kaṇṭaka-sutta announces and then describes ten thorns: socializing as a thorn $for seclusion, pursuit of (physical) beauty as a thorn for cultivation of asubha, enter￾tainments as a thorn for sense restraint, female company as a thorn for celibacy (for $males), sound as a thorn for the first absorption, vitakka-vicāra as a thorn for the $second absorption, rapture as a thorn for the third absorption, inhalation and exhalation $as a thorn for the fourth absorption, perception and feeling as a thorn for the attainment $of cessation, and finally lust (sensual passion), hatred (anger), and delusion (ignorance) $as thorns in general. 
$129 The Pāli parallel is the Sappurisa-sutta, MN 113 at MN III 37; for a comparative $study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
639–643. 
$130 The Sappurisa-sutta takes up several types of distinguished families, which in its $presentation become four different grounds for pride. 
$131 The Sappurisa-sutta does not mention being handsome and agreeable as a potential $ground for pride. 
$132 A related quality in the Sappurisa-sutta is being a preacher of the Dharma (dhamma -$kathika). 
$133 In addition to fame, similarly highlighted in the Sappurisa-sutta, another related ground $for pride in its presentation is the gain of requisites, not mentioned in MĀ 85. 
$425$Notes$134 The Sappurisa-sutta reckons being learned and being versed in the Vinaya as two sep￾arate potential grounds for pride; it also does not refer to the Abhidharma. 
$135 The Sappurisa-sutta only mentions wearing rag robes as a potential ground for pride. 
$136 The Sappurisa-sutta reckons begging alms and taking only one meal as two potential $grounds for pride. 
$137 The corresponding grounds for pride in the Sappurisa-sutta are dwelling in a forest, $at the base of a tree, in a cemetery, and out in the open; additional grounds for pride, $not mentioned in MĀ 85, are the practices of never lying down to rest and accepting $any bed. 
$138 Adopting the variant 受 instead of 愛. 
In the Sappurisa-sutta the true person reflects $that the Buddha had recommended nonidentification (atammayatā) with the first $absorption; the same holds for the other absorptions and immaterial attainments. 
$139 The Sappurisa-sutta additionally takes up the attainment of cessation, which it implicitly $shows to be no longer within reach of the untrue person. 
$140 This discourse is not a parallel to the Chachakka-sutta, MN 148 at MN III 280; cf. 
$Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, p. 
838, n. 
96. 
$Division 8 $141 Adopting a variant that adds 穢 before 經. 
The Pāli parallel is the Anaṅgaṇa-sutta, $MN 5 at MN I 24, which has Jeta’s Grove at Sāvatthī as its location; for a comparative $study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
42–45. 
$142 In the Anaṅgaṇa-sutta the one who asks this question is Mahāmoggallāna. 
$143 Here and below, the Anaṅgaṇa-sutta has no statement about the realm of one’s rebirth. 
$144 The Anaṅgaṇa-sutta has this as four distinct topics, namely the wish to be the one $who gives teachings to each of the four assemblies. 
$145 This wish has no counterpart in the Anaṅgaṇa-sutta.$146 The Anaṅgaṇa-sutta has being respected by each of the four assemblies as four distinct $wishes. 
$147 In the Anaṅgaṇa-sutta the corresponding four wishes are for excellent robes, excellent $food, excellent resting places, and excellent medicine. 
The wish for others not to get $the same is therefore only for such excellent requisites, not for others not to get any $requisites at all. 
Since it seems implausible that a monastic would wish for his com￾panions not to receive any requisites, the qualification “[excellent]” has been added $to the translation of MĀ 87. 
$148 The Anaṅgaṇa-sutta notes that others will not respect such a monk even if he engages $in various types of ascetic practice; conversely a monk without defilements will be $respected even if he does not adopt an ascetic living style. 
$426$Notes$149 Instead of feces, in the Anaṅgaṇa-sutta the carcass of a dead animal or a human is $put into the dish. 
$150 Such a warning is not found in the Anaṅgaṇa-sutta.$151 In the Anaṅgaṇa-sutta the onlookers are just curious to know what is inside, without $expecting it to contain something repulsive. 
$152 The Anaṅgaṇa-sutta speaks of the ājīvika Paṇḍuputta who observes Samīti, the son $of a cartwright, at work; it does not refer to a house of Paṇḍuputta. 
$153 The original here refers to a “renunciant,” presumably a mistake caused by the recurrent $reference to the same term in a preceding passage. 
$154 The simile of receiving a flower garland in the Anaṅgaṇa-sutta concerns a woman $or a man. 
$155 The Pāli parallel is the Dhammadāyāda-sutta, MN 3 at MN I 12, which has Jeta’s $Grove at Sāvatthī as its location; for a comparative study see Anālayo, A Comparative $Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
34–37. 
$156 The Dhammadāyāda-sutta does not list by name the monks present on this occasion. 
$157 In the Dhammadāyāda-sutta being heirs in the Dharma is contrasted with being heirs $in material things in general, not just in food and drink. 
$158 A comparable exposition in the Dhammadāyāda-sutta has Sāriputta as its speaker. 
$159 In the Dhammadāyāda-sutta the Buddha had already withdrawn earlier, without any $reference to having a backache and without asking Sāriputta to continue the teaching. 
$160 In the Dhammadāyāda-sutta Sāriputta expounds the matter himself, without asking $the monks to express their understanding of it. 
$161 Here and below, the translation is based on emending 捨離 to read 遠離, in line with $the expression used elsewhere in the discourse. 
$162 The Dhammadāyāda-sutta concludes with the monks rejoicing in what Sāriputta had $said, without any further reference to the Buddha. 
$163 The Pāli parallel is the Anumāna-sutta, MN 15 at MN I 95, which has Bhesakalā $Grove in Bhagga country as its location; for a comparative study see Anālayo, A $Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
124–127. 
$164 The Anumāna-sutta does not refer to the rains retreat. 
$165 The list of qualities in the Anumāna-sutta shows several differences, see the survey $in Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, p. 
126, table 2.8. 
$166 The Anumāna-sutta takes up the case of someone who is easy to admonish before $turning to a comparable reflection regarding one’s own qualities that make one difficult $to admonish. 
$427$Notes$167 The Anumāna-sutta does not have a reflection regarding one’s own qualities that $make one easy to admonish. 
$168 The Anumāna-sutta does not have a counterpart to the ensuing description of how $delight leads on to other awakening factors, to dispassion, and to liberation. 
$169 The Pāli parallel is the Mahācunda-sutta, AN 10.24 at AN V 41, which has Sahajāti $among the Cetis as its location. 
$170 The Mahācunda-sutta cites three related proclamations. 
The first is a proclamation $of one’s knowledge, ñāṇavāda, namely a claim to know and see the Dharma. 
The $second is a proclamation of one’s cultivation, bhāvanāvāda, namely a claim to have $cultivated the body, virtue, the mind, and wisdom. 
The third combines the previous $two into a single claim. 
$171 Here and below, the translation is based on emending 無惡欲 to 惡欲. 
The latter is $the version found immediately afterward in the same sentence. 
$172 The Mahācunda-sutta does not mention uncommunicativeness, deceit, flattery, and $lack of shame and scruples. 
Qualities mentioned only in the Mahācunda-sutta are $delusion, denigration, and insolence. 
$173 A statement by the relatives and friends is not reported in the Mahācunda-sutta, which $concludes its description of the poor person by saying that he will be known for being $poor despite his claims. 
$174 The Pāli parallel is the Sallekha-sutta, MN 8 at MN I 40, which has Jeta’s Grove at $Sāvatthī as its location; for a comparative study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study $of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
59–66. 
$175 This and several other qualities mentioned in MĀ 91 are not in the list in the Sallekha￾sutta; for a comparison of the two lists see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the $Majjhima-nikāya, p. 
62, table 1.9. 
$176 As in the Pāli version, the present reference to “extinction” involves the term pari -$nirvāṇa, 般涅槃; see the discussion in Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli, The Middle Length Dis￾courses of the Buddha, A Translation of the Majjhima Nikāya (Boston: Wisdom Pub￾lications, 1995, reprint 2005), p. 
1184, n. 
111. 
$177 The Pāli parallel is the Vatthūpama-sutta, MN 7 at MN I 36, which has Jeta’s Grove $at Sāvatthī as its location; for a comparative study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study $of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
49–59. 
$178 The Vatthūpama-sutta does not associate this discourse with the time soon after the $Buddha’s awakening. 
$179 The Vatthūpama-sutta does not introduce the brahmin at this point and does not $mention that the Buddha’s exposition of defilements was related to him. 
$180 The Vatthūpama-sutta lists sixteen defilements; for a comparison of the lists of defile￾ments see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, p. 
51, table 1.7. 
$428$Notes$181 The simile in the Vatthūpama-sutta describes a dirty cloth that does not take dye $properly. 
In the Vatthūpama-sutta this simile and the next one together precede the $exposition of defilements. 
$182 The simile in the Vatthūpama-sutta describes a clean cloth that takes dye properly. 
$183 Before turning to the brahmavihāras, the Vatthūpama-sutta mentions confidence in $the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, and detachment in regard to food. 
It continues $from the brahmavihāras to the topic of liberation, which in its presentation corresponds $to the inner bathing. 
$184 In the Vatthūpama-sutta the brahmin goes forth and eventually becomes an arahant. 
$185 The Pāli parallel is the Adhikaraṇa-sutta, AN 10.87 at AN V 164. 
$186 The Adhikaraṇa-sutta does not report that the monk, on account of whom the Buddha $delivers the discourse, had approached the Buddha. 
$187 The Adhikaraṇa-sutta lists ten such bad qualities: being a maker of disciplinary issues, $not being desirous of training, having evil wishes, being angry, denigrating others, $being crafty, being deceitful, not paying attention to the teachings, not being secluded, $and not showing kindness towards other monastics. 
In the Pāli discourse the list of $unbeneficial results does not refer to the attainment of nirvana. 
$188 The Pāli parallel is the Ṭhiti-sutta, AN 10.53 at AN V 96. 
$189 In the Ṭhiti-sutta the Buddha instead proclaims that he praises only growth in whole￾some states, not their mere maintenance, much less their decline. 
$190 The qualities listed in the Ṭhiti-sutta are faith, virtue, learning, generosity, wisdom, $and eloquence. 
$191 The Ṭhiti-sutta introduces its list of mental states with the simile of a young woman $or man who looks in a mirror; the actual list then comprises ten mental states, which $are the five hindrances (the fourth is just restlessness), as well as irritation, defiled $mental states, bodily agitation, laziness, and lack of concentration. 
$192 According to the Ṭhiti-sutta, one who is free of those states should make an effort to $progress to nirvana. 
The Ṭhiti-sutta does not employ the simile of the burning head $or clothes to illustrate this case, which it only has to illustrate the case of one under $the influence of defiled mental states. 
$193 The Pāli parallel is the Parihāna-sutta, AN 10.55 at AN V 102. 
$194 In the Parihāna-sutta Sāriputta first announces the topic of “a person subject to $decline” and then, at the request of the other monks, expounds it. 
$195 The Parihāna-sutta introduces its list of mental states with the simile of a young $woman or man who looks in a mirror; the actual list then comprises ten mental states, $which are being free of the five hindrances (the fourth is just being without restlessness), $as well as not being irritable, not having defiled mental states, delighting in the $429$Notes$Dharma, gaining internal tranquility of the mind, and gaining higher wisdom and $insight into phenomena. 
$196 According to the Parihāna-sutta, one who is free of these states should make an effort $to progress to nirvana. 
The Parihāna-sutta does not employ the simile of the burning $head or clothes to illustrate this case, which it only has to illustrate the case of one $under the influence of defiled mental states. 
$Division 9$197 The Pāli parallel is the Mahānidāna-sutta, DN 15 at DN II 55. 
$198 Adopting the variant 令 instead of 念. 
$199 The Mahānidāna-sutta continues further, via feeling, contact, and name-and-form, $up to consciousness. 
$200 Adopting the variant reading 蛟 instead of 蚊. 
$201 The Mahānidāna-sutta also mentions the birth of quadrupeds. 
$202 The Mahānidāna-sutta instead lists the three types of becoming: sense sphere, material, $and immaterial. 
$203 The Mahānidāna-sutta mentions the four types of clinging to sensuality, to views, $to rules and observances, and to doctrines of a self. 
$204 The Mahānidāna-sutta lists the six types of craving, according to the six sense objects. 
$205 The Mahānidāna-sutta proceeds further to the topic of feeling. 
$206 The translation here and below is based on an emendation. 
MĀ 97 links contact with $the name group by way of “resistance” 對, and with the form group by way of “des￾ignation” 增語. 
The Mahānidāna-sutta instead links contact with the name group by $way of “designation,” adhivacana, and with the form group by way of “resistance,” $paṭigha. 
The presentation in the Mahānidāna-sutta is clearly the more appropriate $one, whereas the present passage in MĀ 97 seems to have resulted from an erroneous $exchange of the two terms. 
$207 The Mahānidāna-sutta also reckons being born, growing old, dying, etc., as results $of the reciprocal conditionality between consciousness and name-and-form. 
$208 In the Mahānidāna-sutta the Buddha first examines different notions of a self as being $material or immaterial, limited or unlimited, before discussing the three ways of $relating views of a self to feeling. 
$209 In the Mahānidāna-sutta the holder of the view of self concludes that the self has $departed once the particular type of feeling identified as the self ceases. 
$210 Adopting the variant reading 雜 instead of 離. 
$430$Notes$211 The Mahānidāna-sutta, where this is the second of the three types of view of self in $relation to feeling, instead argues that the notion “I am this” would no longer exist. 
$212 The reason given in the Mahānidāna-sutta is more detailed, pointing out that a lib￾erated one is freed from the pathways of designation and conceptualization, yet it $would be inappropriate to view such a liberated monk as one who does not know $and does not see. 
$213 Since the Mahānidāna-sutta has the corresponding exposition earlier, before the $examination of the three types of view of a self in relation to feeling, at this point it $instead continues by listing the seven stations of consciousness, the two spheres, and $the eight liberations, also found later in MĀ 97. 
$214 In the Mahānidāna-sutta one who upholds a certain type of self instead expects to $realize that type of self after death. 
$215 The Pāli parallel is the Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta, MN 10 at MN I 55; for a comparative $study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
73–97, and $Perspectives on Satipaṭṭhāna (Cambridge: Windhorse, 2013). 
$216 A statement on past, future, or present tathāgatas is not found in the Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta.$217 The Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta additionally mentions that such contemplation is undertaken $diligently, clearly knowing, and free from desire or discontent toward the world. 
$218 The sequence of the body contemplations in the Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta differs, proceeding $from mindfulness of breathing to bodily postures, bodily activities, anatomical parts, $elements, and the cemetery contemplations. 
$219 The Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta does not mention falling asleep or waking up as part of the $contemplation of bodily postures. 
$220 The Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta also mentions the contemplation of impermanence and refers $to dwelling independently, without clinging to anything. 
$221 The Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta also mentions eating, drinking, consuming food, tasting, defe￾cating, and urinating. 
$222 This and the following exercise are not mentioned in the Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta.$223 Adopting the variant 絣 instead of 拼. 
$224 The translation is based on emending what in the original is a reference to “verbal $activities” when breathing out, clearly a textual error. 
The Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta has a $simile of a turner at work at a lathe to illustrate mindfulness of breathing. 
$225 Whereas the Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta does not mention this and the subsequent three exer￾cises, the Kāyagatāsati-sutta, MN 119 at MN III 92, does reckon the bodily experience $of each of the four absorptions as modes of body contemplation. 
$226 This and the following exercise are not mentioned in the Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta.$431$Notes$227 觀相, which perhaps is an equivalent to the paccavekkhaṇanimitta.$228 This list of seeds differs from the one given in the same simile in MĀ 81, the parallel $to the Kāyagatāsati-sutta. 
$229 The Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta only lists the four elements of earth, water, fire, and wind. 
$230 Cremation or burial are not mentioned in the Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta.$231 Nuns are not explicitly mentioned in the Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta, although the same would $be implicit, in as much as the term “monk” can represent monastics of either gender; $see Alice Collett and Bhikkhu Anālayo, “Bhikkhave and Bhikkhu as Gender-inclusive $Terminology in Early Buddhist Texts,” Journal of Buddhist Ethics 21 (2014): 760–797. 
$232 The Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta does not mention a distinction between bodily and mental $feelings, or between feelings related or not related to sensuality. 
$233 The Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta does not mention mental states that are defiled or undefiled, $inferior or superior, or developed or undeveloped. 
$234 Contemplation of dharmas in the Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta also covers contemplating the $five aggregates of clinging and the Four Noble Truths, which are the second and fifth $exercises in its version of the fourth satipaṭṭhāna.$235 In the Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta, where contemplation of the six sense spheres is the third $exercise under contemplation of dharmas, the task is also to know the senses and their $objects as such, in addition to knowing the fetter that arises in dependence on both. 
$236 Adopting a variant reading that adds 擇. 
$237 The Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta proceeds from a period of seven years of practice step by step $down to seven days, but no further than that. 
$238 The Pāli parallel is the Mahādukkhakkhandha-sutta, MN 13 at MN I 83; for a comparative $study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
117–121. 
$239 In the Mahādukkhakkhandha-sutta the monks themselves, on their way into town to $collect alms, had approached the heterodox wanderers. 
$240 The Mahādukkhakkhandha-sutta treats what has been mentioned so far as three $distinct cases illustrating the danger of sensual pleasures, namely the suffering expe￾rienced when working, when such work does not succeed, and when what has been $gained is lost again. 
$241 According to the Mahādukkhakkhandha-sutta, family members may even go so far $as to take up weapons and harm one another. 
$242 男女, “men and women,” which in the present context presumably means “people.” $243 The regret experienced by an evildoer is not mentioned in the Mahādukkhakkhandha￾sutta, which therefore does not have the simile of a mountain’s shadow. 
A version of $this simile can be found in the Bālapaṇḍita-sutta, MN 129 at MN III 164. 
$432$Notes$244 The Pāli parallel is the Cūḷadukkhakkhandha-sutta, MN 14 at MN I 91; for a compar￾ative study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
121–124. 
$245 This request, which has no counterpart in the Cūḷadukkhakkhandha-sutta, implies $that Mahānāma was still a worldling at the time of this discourse. 
According to the $commentary on the Cūḷadukkhakkhandha-sutta, Ps II 61, however, he was a once￾returner at that time. 
$246 In the Cūḷadukkhakkhandha-sutta the Buddha first relates how he overcame sensuality $in the period before his awakening. 
The ensuing exposition of sensual pleasures is $the same as in the Mahādukkhakkhandha-sutta.$247 The Cūḷadukkhakkhandha-sutta treats what has been mentioned so far as three distinct $cases illustrating the danger in sensual pleasures, namely the suffering experienced $when working, when such work does not succeed, and when what has been gained $is lost through theft, etc. 
$248 According to the Cūḷadukkhakkhandha-sutta, family members may even go so far $as to take up weapons and harm one another. 
$249 See note 242. 
$250 The regret experienced by an evildoer is not mentioned in the Cūḷadukkhakkhandha￾sutta, which therefore does not have the simile of a mountain’s shadow. 
A version of $this simile can be found in the Bālapaṇḍita-sutta, MN 129 at MN III 164. 
$251 In the Cūḷadukkhakkhandha-sutta the Buddha relates his insight into sensual pleasures $to the time before his awakening, explaining that despite this insight he transcended $the attraction of sensual pleasures only after he had experienced superior forms of $happiness, such as those available through absorption attainment. 
$252 The location in the Cūḷadukkhakkhandha-sutta is Mount Vulture Peak. 
$253 According to the Cūḷadukkhakkhandha-sutta, the Nigaṇṭhas attributed omniscience $to their teacher. 
$254 In the Cūḷadukkhakkhandha-sutta the Buddha instead inquires if the Nigaṇṭhas had $knowledge of former evil deeds done by them and if they were aware of the degree $to which these deeds were now being eradicated. 
$255 The Cūḷadukkhakkhandha-sutta specifies that such deeds were acts of murder. 
$256 The Buddha’s rebuke in the Cūḷadukkhakkhandha-sutta is less strongly worded; he $simply points out that they spoke rashly and should have asked him about it. 
$257 In the Cūḷadukkhakkhandha-sutta the Buddha’s ability to remain motionless in joy $and happiness for up to seven days takes the form of an affirmation instead of being $a question. 
$258 The Cūḷadukkhakkhandha-sutta concludes at this point. 
$433$Notes$259 The Pāli parallel is the Vitakkasaṇṭhāna-sutta, MN 20 at MN I 118; for a comparative $study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
140–143. 
$260 Adopting the variant 絣 instead of 拼. 
$261 The Vitakkasaṇṭhāna-sutta instead describes a carpenter who removes a coarse peg $with the help of a finer peg. 
$262 Adopting the variant 正 instead of 政. 
$263 The Vitakkasaṇṭhāna-sutta continues with a description of the attainment of liberation. 
$264 The Pāli parallel is the Dvedhāvitakka-sutta, MN 19 at MN I 114; for a comparative $study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
138–140. 
$265 The Dvedhāvitakka-sutta does not follow the description of frequent thinking leading $to a tendency of the mind to delight in such thoughts with a statement about freedom $from dukkha. 
Instead, in the Pāli version the simile of the cowherd comes at this point. 
$266 The expected description of the first absorption is lacking here, but is present in the $Dvedhāvitakka-sutta. 
It could be restored as follows: “Secluded from sensual desires, $secluded from evil and unwholesome states, he dwells having attained the first absorp￾tion, which is with directed awareness and sustained contemplation, with rapture and $happiness born of separation.” $267 The Dvedhāvitakka-sutta mentions recollection of past lives and the divine eye before $turning to the destruction of the taints. 
Another difference in the Pāli version is that the $one who attains the absorptions and the three higher knowledges is the Buddha himself. 
$268 Here and below, the Dvedhāvitakka-sutta only identifies the path with the eightfold $wrong or right path, not with the three unwholesome or wholesome thoughts. 
$269 The simile in the Dvedhāvitakka-sutta contains no watchman; hence its explanation $of the simile also has no reference to the retinue of Māra. 
$270 The Pāli parallel is the Cūḷasīhanāda-sutta, MN 11 at MN I 63, which has Jeta’s $Grove at Sāvatthī as its location; for a comparative study see Anālayo, A Comparative $Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
99–105. 
$271 This would refer to the four levels of awakening; see AN 4.239 at AN II 238. 
$272 The Cūḷasīhanāda-sutta has craving and clinging as two separate topics. 
The next $topics it discusses are being without vision, favoring and opposing, and enjoying $conceptual proliferation, papañca. 
It does not sum up all the qualifications of the $final goal thus covered. 
$273 In the Cūḷasīhanāda-sutta the fourth type is clinging to “a doctrine of self” rather $than to “a self.” $274 The Cūḷasīhanāda-sutta relates the four types of clinging to ignorance via the inter￾vening seven links of dependent arising, paṭicca samuppāda.$434$Notes$275 The Cūḷasīhanāda-sutta does not repeat the reference to the lion’s roar. 
$276 The Pāli parallel is the Udumbarika-sutta, DN 25 at DN III 36 (following the Asian $editions for the title; in the PTS edition the title is Udumbarika-sīhanāda-sutta). 
$277 In the Udumbarika-sutta the householder’s name is Sandhāna. 
$278 無恚, literally, “no anger,” apparently mistaking nigrodha for ni + krodha. 
$279 鳥論, literally “bird talk”; elsewhere the Madhyama-āgama employs the expression $畜生之論 as its counterpart to tiracchānakathā.$280 The Udumbarika-sutta does not report Nigrodha making any statement about how $the Buddha should be offered a seat. 
$281 In the Udumbarika-sutta Nigrodha and his followers had indeed been intending to $ask the Buddha this question if he should join them. 
Consequently, the Pāli version $does not report a reflection by the householder Sandhāna that Nigrodha is speaking $a falsehood. 
$282 One of several differences is that the Udumbarika-sutta does not mention shaving off $the hair and beard (a practice that is in fact followed by Buddhist monastics themselves). 
$283 The partly different list of defilements of self-mortification in the Udumbarika-sutta does not mention absorbing the energy of the sun, a reference whose implications $are not clear. 
$284 Adopting a variant that adds another 子. 
$285 “Views” is another topic that is not included in the Udumbarika-sutta’s list of defile￾ments of self-mortification. 
$286 The four restraints in the Udumbarika-sutta are not killing, not stealing, not speaking $falsehoods, and not yearning for sensual pleasures (following the commentarial expla￾nation for the last). 
The Pāli version goes on to describe withdrawal into seclusion $and overcoming the five hindrances. 
$287 Here and below, according to the Udumbarika-sutta, Nigrodha thinks that by now $the practice of self-mortification has reached the essence. 
$288 In the Udumbarika-sutta they instead exclaim that they are lost, as they do not know $this higher attainment. 
Right after that the householder Sandhāna intervenes, reminding $Nigrodha of his earlier dismissive remarks about the Buddha and of his boast that he $would defeat the Buddha with a single question. 
$289 The Udumbarika-sutta does not contain the account of the gradual path to awakening. 
$290 In the Udumbarika-sutta Nigrodha formally confesses his transgression of speaking $like this about the Buddha. 
$291 The Udumbarika-sutta lists various time periods from seven years down to seven $days within which a disciple may reach the goal. 
$435$Notes$292 In the Udumbarika-sutta the Buddha also points out that he does not require heterodox $practitioners to abandon their rules and way of life, to do what they consider unwhole￾some, or to abstain from doing what they consider wholesome. 
The Pāli version does $not mention the suspicion that the Buddha might be interested in capturing and destroy￾ing them or in obtaining offerings or fame. 
$293 The Udumbarika-sutta records no comment or teaching given by the Buddha to the $householder, who returns to Rājagaha on his own. 
$294 The Pāli parallel is the Ākhaṅkheyya-sutta, MN 6 at MN I 33; for a comparative study $see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
45–49. 
$295 Adopting the variant 住 instead of 任. 
$296 The Ākhaṅkheyya-sutta does not have an introductory narration recording the monk’s $reflection. 
It begins with the Buddha addressing the monks, emphasizing the need to $maintain virtuous conduct, seeing danger in the slightest fault. 
$297 In the Ākhaṅkheyya-sutta the wish to be taught by the Buddha is not in the list of $wishes, which includes the following: to be dear to other monks, to receive requisites, $to be a source of merit for supporters, to be a source of merit for relatives, to bear $discontent, to bear fear, and to attain the four absorptions, the immaterial attainments, $stream-entry, once-returning, nonreturning, and each of the six higher knowledges. 
$298 The Ākhaṅkheyya-sutta does not report that the monks put the Buddha’s instruction $into practice. 
$299 Chizen Akanuma, The Comparative Catalogue of Chinese Āgamas & Pāli Nikāyas $(Delhi: Sri Satguru, 1990, reprint), p. 
15, lists as a parallel for MĀ 106 the Mūla￾pariyāya-sutta, MN 1 at MN I 1. 
However, these two discourses differ considerably $and do not seem to be “parallels,” properly speaking; see the discussion in Anālayo, $A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, p. 
23. 
$Division 10$300 The Pāli parallel is the Vanapattha-sutta, MN 17 at MN I 104; for a comparative study $see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
132–134. 
$301 The Vanapattha-sutta first examines the case of a monk who has no improvement in $his practice and scarce requisites; then the cases of no improvement and ample req￾uisites, improvement and scarce requisites, and improvement and ample requisites. 
$302 As in the case of the preceding discourse, MĀ 107, the Pāli parallel to the present $MĀ 108 is the Vanapattha-sutta, MN 17 at MN I 104; for a comparative study see $Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
132–134. 
$303 This reflection differs from the one in MĀ 107, which is closer to the Vanapattha￾sutta, both of which refer to cultivating mindfulness and concentration, as well as $achieving the destruction of the taints. 
$436$Notes$304 The Vanapattha-sutta first examines the case of a monk who has no improvement of $his practice and scarce requisites; then the cases of no improvement and ample req￾uisites, improvement and scarce requisites, and improvement and ample requisites. 
$305 The Pāli parallel is the Samatha-sutta, AN 10.54 at AN V 98. 
$306 The Samatha-sutta likens this to a young woman or a young man examining her or $his face in a mirror. 
$307 The Samatha-sutta concludes after the case of the person, having no counterpart for $the general statement that follows in MĀ 109. 
$308 Adopting a variant that adds 法, in accordance with earlier instances of the same phrase. 
$309 The Pāli parallel is the Sacitta-sutta, AN 10.51 at AN V 92. 
$310 The Sacitta-sutta likens this to a young woman or a young man examining her or his $face in a mirror. 
$311 The Sacitta-sutta does not mention faith, mindfulness, and wisdom. 
As already noted $by Bhikkhu Bodhi, The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha, p. 
1844, n. 
2061, these, $together with energy and concentration (mentioned in both versions), would constitute $the five faculties. 
$312 The Sacitta-sutta concludes at this point, having no counterpart for the discussion of $robes, etc. 
$313 The Pāli parallel is the Nibbedhika-sutta, AN 6.63 at AN III 410. 
$314 The Nibbedhika-sutta has two minor differences in sequence: (1) it begins with sensual $pleasures, discussing the taints only later at the point where MĀ 111 refers to sensual $pleasures; (2) in each case it discusses the diversity before the results. 
$315 In the Nibbedhika-sutta the result of feelings is rather the coming to an individual $existence partaking of merit or demerit. 
$316 The present description corresponds to the instruction on contemplation of feeling $in the parallel to the Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta, MĀ 98. 
Like the Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta, the $Nibbedhika-sutta does not mention bodily and mental feelings, and feelings related $or not related to sensual pleasures. 
$317 The Nibbedhika-sutta lists six types of perception according to the six sense objects. 
$318 The Nibbedhika-sutta presents a threefold distinction of karma according to it being $experienced in this life, the next, or later. 
$319 Instead of association with what is disliked and dissociation from what is liked, the $Nibbedhika-sutta mentions sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair. 
$320 Adopting the variant reading 集 instead of 習. 
$437$Notes$321 The Nibbedhika-sutta locates the search for help from outsiders under the “result of $dukkha,” and the fourfold distinction into minor or intense dukkha that passes away $quickly or slowly under the “diversity of dukkha.” $322 The Pāli parallel is the Purisindriyañāṇa-sutta (or Udaka-sutta), AN 6.62 at AN III $402, which has Daṇḍakappa in Kosala as its location. 
$323 The Purisindriyañāṇa-sutta reports that Ānanda had gone with a group of monks to $bathe and one monk had asked the question about Devadatta, which Ānanda then $reported to the Buddha. 
$324 No such reaction by Ānanda is reported in the Purisindriyañāṇa-sutta.$325 The Purisindriyañāṇa-sutta only illustrates this case with the example of good seeds $placed in fertile soil (which in MĀ 112 appears a little later); it has the simile of the $sunrise in relation to one who manifests wholesomeness and whose unwholesome $roots will soon become extinct. 
$326 The second case in the Purisindriyañāṇa-sutta is rather someone whose unwholesome $qualities have disappeared but who still has the roots of unwholesomeness, comparable $to seeds deposited on a rock. 
$327 The fourth case in the Purisindriyañāṇa-sutta is rather someone whose wholesome $qualities have disappeared and whose roots of wholesomeness will also disappear, $likened to burning coals deposited on a rock or the onset of darkness at sunset. 
$328 At this point the Purisindriyañāṇa-sutta ends, with no counterpart for the final injunc￾tion in MĀ 112. 
$329 The Pāli parallels are the Mūlaka-suttas, AN 8.83 at AN IV 338 and AN 10.58 at AN $V 106. 
These differ in having eight and ten topics respectively; MĀ 113 has nine. 
$330 These practices are not mentioned in the Mūlaka-suttas themselves, but a comparable $description can be found in the discourse after the second Mūlaka-sutta, AN 10.59 $at AN V 106. 
$331 The Pāli parallel is the Uddaka-sutta, SN 35.103 at SN IV 83. 
$332 In the Uddaka-sutta his proclamation takes the form of a stanza worded differently. 
$333 Instead of omniscience, the claim in the Uddaka-sutta is to have conquered everything. 
$334 The translation of 狸 follows the indication in Hirakawa, Buddhist Chinese-Sanskrit $Dictionary, p. 
814, that this can render jambuka. 
This entire paragraph with the descrip￾tion of Uddaka’s attainment and rebirth has no counterpart in the Uddaka-sutta.$335 The three feelings are not discussed in the Uddaka-sutta.$336 The three cravings are not discussed in the Uddaka-sutta; nor are the six taints related $to the senses. 
$438$Notes$337 Instead of an exhortation to practice, the Uddaka-sutta repeats the earlier quoted $stanza, attributed to Uddaka, together with the Buddha’s comment on it. 
$338 The Pāli parallel is the Madhupiṇḍika-sutta, MN 18 at MN I 108; for a comparative $study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
134–138. 
$339 Adopting the variant 行 instead of 志. 
$340 The Madhupiṇḍika-sutta speaks of not delighting in the source of perceptions and $notions (related to) conceptual proliferation, papañca.$341 分別, whereas the Madhupiṇḍika-sutta speaks of conceptual proliferation, papañca. 
$342 The Madhupiṇḍika-sutta adopts the opposite sequence, discussing first the presence $of the sense organs and then their absence. 
$343 In the Madhupiṇḍika-sutta it is Ānanda who delivers the simile of the honeyball, $which involves a hungry person. 
$344 Adopting the variant 道 instead of 通. 
$345 The Pāli parallel is the Gotamī-sutta, AN 8.51 at AN IV 274; for a comparative study $see Anālayo, Madhyama-āgama Studies, pp. 
449–488, 2016a. 
$346 Gotamī’s request in the Pāli discourse does not refer to the four fruits of a renunciant, $which represent the four levels of awakening; she also makes three requests one right $after the other. 
$347 According to the Gotamī-sutta, they had shaved off their hair and put on yellow robes. 
$348 The Gotamī-sutta has a comparable set of similes at its end, after Ānanda has told $the Buddha that Gotamī has become a nun. 
The similes describe robbers easily assailing $a house with many females and few males, and two types of disease afflicting a rice $field or a sugar field, respectively. 
These are followed by a version of the simile of $the dike, which in MĀ 116 introduces the eight garudhammas. 
$349 In the Gotamī-sutta Ānanda inquires about women’s ability to awaken and reminds $the Buddha of his debt of gratitude to his foster mother Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī. 
The $Buddha affirms the first and does not reply to the second, but next promulgates the $eight garudhammas. 
A clarification by the Buddha that he has already settled his debt $of gratitude to his foster mother can be found in the Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga-sutta, MN $142 at MN III 254. 
$350 The eight garudhammas in the Gotamī-sutta come in a different sequence. 
The garu -$dhamma on higher ordination refers to the probationary training and stipulates that $ordination is to be given by both communities. 
$351 The corresponding garudhamma in the Gotamī-sutta does not mention questions $about the discourses, Vinaya, or Abhidharma. 
$439$Notes$352 The remainder of MĀ 116 has no counterpart in the Gotamī-sutta; Gotamī’s request $for the garudhamma on respect to be abolished can be found at Vin II 257. 
$353 This refers to becoming a buddha, not to becoming an arahant. 
$Division 11$354 The Pāli parallel is the Sukhumāla-sutta, AN 3.38 at AN I 145. 
$355 The identification of some flower names is tentative. 
$356 The Sukhumāla-sutta does not report the young prince’s attainment of the first $absorption. 
$357 MĀ 117 refers not only to old age and illness, but also to death in the stanzas that $follow. 
This makes it safe to conclude that the prose section in MĀ 117 has lost an $exposition on the topic of death; in fact the same topic is found also in the Sukhumāla￾sutta. 
The apparently lost text could be supplemented as follows: “Again, I thought, $‘Unlearned ignorant worldlings are themselves subject to death, not exempt from $death. 
On seeing other people die, they feel disgust and slight them as undesirable $and unpleasant, not observing their own condition.’ Again I thought, ‘I am myself $subject to death, not exempt from death. 
If on seeing other people die I were to feel $disgust and were to slight them as undesirable and unpleasant, then that would not $be appropriate for me, since I too am subject to this condition.’ On my having con￾templated in this way, the pride caused by life naturally vanished.” $358 The Pāli parallel is the Nāga-sutta, AN 6.43 at AN III 344, which has Jeta’s Grove, $also in Sāvatthī, as its location. 
$359 In the Nāga-sutta the Buddha goes to bathe with Ānanda, after both have spent the $day meditating in the Hall of Migāra’s Mother. 
$360 念. 
In the Nāga-sutta the elephant is called Seta. 
$361 Bhikkhu Bodhi, The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha, p. 
1756, n. 
1317, explains $that the corresponding statement in the Pāli version (on not doing evil by body, speech, $and mind) involves a pun based on a playful etymology of nāga as na āguṃ, “no $evil.” That the Tathāgata is such a nāga is not explicitly stated in the Nāga-sutta. 
$362 On this stanza see Bhikkhu Bodhi, The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha, p. 
1756, $n. 
1319. 
$363 In the Nāga-sutta the elephant’s tusks represent equanimity and its tail represents $seclusion. 
$364 The Pāli parallel is the Kathāvatthu-sutta, AN 3.67 at AN I 197. 
$365 The Kathāvatthu-sutta proceeds directly from the initial statement of three grounds $for talk to the analysis of past, present, and future. 
$366 The Kathāvatthu-sutta does not at this juncture describe arrival at liberation. 
$440$Notes$367 The Kathāvatthu-sutta discusses questions to be answered in four ways: categorically, $by making a distinction, by asking a counter-question, and by setting the question aside. 
$368 The Kathāvatthu-sutta continues by further analyzing types of talk. 
$369 The Pāli parallel is the Arahanta-sutta, SN 22.76 at SN III 82. 
$370 Adopting a variant that adds 三十. 
The Arahanta-sutta instead describes how insight $into the three characteristics in relation to the five aggregates leads to disenchantment $and dispassion toward them, resulting in liberation. 
$371 七善法, with its counterpart in the seven saddhammas in the Arahanta-sutta; these $seven wholesome states are listed in the Saṅgīti-sutta, DN 33 at DN III 252, as faith, $shame, fear of wrongdoing, learning, energy, mindfulness, and wisdom. 
$372 The Pāli parallel is the Pavāraṇā-sutta, SN 8.7 at SN I 190, which has the Hall of $Migāra’s Mother at Sāvatthī as its location. 
$373 In the Pavāraṇā-sutta the Buddha makes no statement about his own attainments $and instead invites the monks to point out any censurable deeds of his. 
$374 The Pavāraṇā-sutta makes no reference to one monk who has yet to attain the final goal. 
$375 In the Pavāraṇā-sutta the Buddha, without being asked to do so, lists sixty monks $who have the three higher knowledges, sixty who have the six direct knowledges, $and sixty who are liberated both ways; the remainder of the five hundred monks are $liberated by wisdom. 
The Pavāraṇā-sutta does not report a statement by the Buddha $comparing the assembled monks to heartwood. 
$376 The three stanzas beginning with “shining with pure light” up to the present one have $no counterpart in the Pavāraṇā-sutta.$377 In the final stanza of the Pavāraṇā-sutta Vaṅgīsa pays homage to the Kinsman of the $Sun (i.e., the Buddha), who has destroyed the arrow of craving. 
$378 The Pāli parallel to the first part of MĀ 122 is the Uposatha-sutta, AN 8.20 at AN IV $204, which has the Hall of Migāra’s Mother at Sāvatthī as its location. 
The second part $of MĀ 122 has a parallel in the Kāraṇḍava-sutta, AN 8.10 at AN IV 168. 
$379 The Uposatha-sutta reports that the Buddha sat in silence, without stating that he had $entered concentration and observed the minds of the monks in the assembly. 
Only $the commentary, Mp IV 112, states that the Buddha had observed the minds of the $monks and discerned one without virtue. 
$380 According to the Uposatha-sutta, the one who asked the Buddha to recite the $pātimokkha (code of rules) was Ānanda. 
$381 In the Uposatha-sutta Mahāmoggallāna first tells the monk three times to leave, $and only when the monk keeps sitting silently does he take him by the arm and $lead him outside. 
$441$Notes$382 The Uposatha-sutta does not refer to the head of the monk possibly splitting into $seven pieces, a danger mentioned only in the commentary, Mp IV 112. 
$383 The Uposatha-sutta continues with the eight extraordinary qualities of the ocean $comparable to eight extraordinary qualities of the Buddha’s teaching. 
The exposition $in the remainder of MĀ 122 on a monk who pretends to be genuine by acting with $right comprehension has a parallel in the Kāraṇḍava-sutta, AN 8.10 at AN IV 168. 
$384 The Pāli parallel is the Soṇa-sutta, AN 6.55 at AN III 374, which has Mount Vulture $Peak at Rājagaha as its location. 
$385 The Soṇa-sutta says that Soṇa Kolivīsa stayed in the Sītavana at Rājagaha. 
It reports $only that he was living in seclusion and gives no further details about his practice. 
$386 In the Soṇa-sutta the Buddha instead uses supernormal means to disappear from $Mount Vulture Peak and reappear before Soṇa in the Sītavana. 
$387 The Soṇa-sutta does not report Soṇa’s embarrassment or his realization that the $Buddha knew his thoughts. 
$388 In the Soṇa-sutta the six experiences are being determined on renunciation, seclusion, $nonaffliction, the destruction of craving, the destruction of clinging, and nonconfusion. 
$389 The Soṇa-sutta does not discuss the topic of one in training and thus has no counterpart $to the simile of a young boy’s faculties and habits. 
$390 The Soṇa-sutta concludes with this last stanza and has no counterpart to the remainder $of MĀ 124. 
$391 The Pāli parallel is the Akkhaṇa-sutta, AN 8.29 at AN IV 225. 
$392 The Akkhaṇa-sutta has the last two in the opposite sequence, first the problem of $holding wrong views and then the problem of being unable to understand. 
$393 The Pāli parallel is the Iṇa-sutta, AN 6.45 at AN III 351. 
$394 The Iṇa-sutta lists lack of faith, of shame, of fear of wrongdoing, of energy, and of $wisdom, all in relation to wholesome states. 
It does not mention that such a person $might possess gold and precious stones. 
$395 The Iṇa-sutta does not refer to the arahant at this juncture. 
$396 Adopting the variant 安 instead of 棄. 
$397 The comparison to a lamp is not found in the Iṇa-sutta.$398 The Pāli parallel is the Kāmabhogī-sutta, AN 10.91 at AN V 176. 
$399 The Kāmabhogī-sutta takes up all of the ten types introduced earlier and points out $in each case on how many grounds these are to be criticized or praised. 
$400 One who seeks wealth by partially improper means could hardly qualify as being $superior to one who does so by entirely proper means. 
The added part in brackets is $442$Notes therefore intended to clarify that this refers only to those who similarly seek wealth $through mixed means. 
Judging from the ensuing verse, this passage seems to be the $result of a textual error and would originally have been about one who seeks wealth $by proper means but is attached to it. 
$401 The Kāmabhogī-sutta contains no verses. 
$402 The Pāli parallel is the Dakkhiṇeyyā-sutta, AN 2.4.4 at AN I 62. 
$403 A distinction of the two types of persons into eighteen and nine kinds is not found in $the Dakkhiṇeyyā-sutta, which instead continues after the twofold distinction with $verses spoken by the Buddha. 
$404 “One-seeder” refers to a stream-enterer who will experience only one more life. 
$405 Whereas the previous list of those in training represents material common to the early $discourses in different reciter traditions, the present list of those beyond training $reflects later ideas held in the Sarvāstivāda reciter tradition, which transmitted the $Madhyama-āgama. 
A similar list can be found in the Abhidharmakośavyākhyā; see $Wogihara, Sphuṭārthā Abhidharmakośavyākhyā by Yaśomitra, Part II, p. 
566. 
$406 The Pāli parallel is the Gihī-sutta, AN 5.179 at AN III 211. 
$407 The Gihī-sutta does not report a meeting between Sāriputta and the group headed by $Anāthapiṇḍika. 
Instead it begins with the arrival of the group in the Buddha’s presence. 
$408 In the Gihī-sutta such a declaration is to be made by the noble disciple him- or herself. 
$409 The Gihī-sutta merely lists the five precepts, without going into details. 
$410 The Gihī-sutta highlights that the Dharma is directly visible, not involving time, inviting $one to come and see, leading onward, and to be experienced personally by the wise. 
$Here and in relation to the other three pleasant mental abidings, the Gihī-sutta mentions $only that they serve to purify the impure mind and cleanse the unclean mind. 
$411 The Gihī-sutta only refers to the four pairs (of noble ones), the eight persons, without $listing them individually and without noting that they are accomplished in morality, $concentration, wisdom, liberation, and the knowledge and vision of liberation. 
$412 The Gihī-sutta does not have the comparison to the earth. 
$413 The Gihī-sutta describes such a person in more detail, qualifying him in various ways $as a liberated one. 
$414 In the Gihī-sutta those who give to outsiders are considered fools. 
$415 The Pāli parallel is the Kodhana-sutta, AN 7.60 at AN IV 94. 
$416 In the Kodhana-sutta, where loss of wealth is the fourth in the list, such loss comes $about through confiscation in the king’s name. 
$417 Adopting the variant 盛 instead of 止. 
$443$Notes$418 Besides parents, the Kodhana-sutta also mentions killing a brahmin (which according $to the commentary means an arahant) or a worldling. 
$419 Adopting the variant 業 instead of 逆. 
$420 The Pāli parallel is the Dhammika-sutta, AN 6.54 at AN III 366, which has Mount $Vulture Peak at Rājagaha as its location. 
$421 In the Dhammika-sutta Dhammika several times leaves one monastery and goes to $another one, where the same events happen, until eventually the lay disciples tell him $to leave all seven monasteries of the region. 
$422 The discussion in the Dhammika-sutta proceeds differently. 
On seeing Dhammika, $the Buddha asks him where he is coming from, in reply to which Dhammika explains $that he has been banished. 
In response to that, the Buddha delivers the simile of the $bird and right away continues with the story of King Koravya’s banyan tree. 
$423 The Dhammika-sutta does not describe the general conditions at the time of King $Koravya, nor does it speak of him as a wheel-turning monarch. 
$424 The Dhammika-sutta does not report how King Koravya came to know that the banyan $tree no longer bore fruit; this information is found only in the commentary, Mp III $386. 
It also merely reports that King Koravya approached Sakka, without explicitly $stating that he did so by supernormal means or that both returned to Jambudīpa by $the same means. 
$425 In relation to Sunetta and the other teachers, the Dhammika-sutta only mentions that $those who had no confidence in their teaching were reborn in a lower realm. 
A descrip￾tion of Sunetta’s disciples being reborn in different heavenly realms and his own $superior practice and rebirth can be found in AN 7.62 at AN IV 103, and its parallel $MĀ 8 at T I 429b. 
$426 The Dhammika-sutta does not mention Jotipāla’s father, Govinda, and therefore $speaks of only six teachers, although it does refer to Govinda and Jotipāla in its verse $part. 
The Mahāgovinda-sutta, DN 19 at DN II 230, reports that Govinda had been $chaplain to King Disampatī, and Govinda’s son Jotipāla served as chaplain to the son $of Disampatī, King Reṇu (and of his companions). 
Unlike Jotipāla, Govinda did not $go forth to cultivate the brahmavihāras and thus did not become a “teacher” of this $practice to others. 
Therefore, the reference to seven brahmin chaplains but rather six $teachers in the Dhammika-sutta correctly reflects the description in DN 19. 
$427 Adopting the variant 微 instead of 妙. 
$428 The Pāli parallel is the Māratajjanīya-sutta, MN 50 at MN I 332; for a comparative $study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
300–307. 
$429 The Māratajjanīya-sutta does not mention supervision of the construction of a hut $or that Māra made himself smaller. 
$444$Notes$430 According to the Māratajjanīya-sutta, the corresponding monk Vidhura had acquired $his name for being without equal in teaching the Dharma (vidhura can mean $“unequaled”). 
$431 想; in the Māratajjanīya-sutta the corresponding monk Sañjīva is so-called because $he has been “revived,” patisañjīvita.$432 Māra’s reflection in the Māratajjanīya-sutta has no reference to the lineage being severed $due to the renunciants’ lack of sons. 
Instead it describes his plans to get the householders $to abuse the monks in order to upset their minds. 
The denigration about musing, etc., $appears in the Pāli version only as part of the actual abuse of the householders. 
This $abuse begins with the simile of an owl wanting to catch a mouse, followed by a jackal $wanting to catch a fish, a cat wanting to catch a mouse, and an unburdened donkey. 
$433 In the Māratajjanīya-sutta the householders abuse them only verbally; they do not $attack them physically. 
On being reborn in hell, they are not shown to realize that $this happened in retribution for abusing the monks. 
$434 The Māratajjanīya-sutta gives no information about the size of the crowd taught by $Kakusandha. 
$435 The Māratajjanīya-sutta merely reports that the householders behaved respectfully $and reverentially, without detailing in what way they did so. 
On being reborn in $heaven, they are not shown to realize that this happened as a reward for their respectful $behavior toward the monks. 
$436 The advice in the Māratajjanīya-sutta is to contemplate the lack of beauty of the $body, to perceive the repulsiveness of food, to perceive the whole world as without $delight, and to contemplate the impermanence of all formations. 
$437 The Māratajjanīya-sutta does not report Māra’s plan; the actual attack was achieved $by way of taking possession of a boy. 
$438 The Māratajjanīya-sutta gives three names for hell; the period for stake to meet stake $is a thousand years; and the form of rebirth taken by the past māra was a human body $with the head of a fish. 
$439 The verses in the Māratajjanīya-sutta show several differences and tend to be less $detailed.

$1675 School Street $Moraga, California 94556 $Printed in the United States of America$A Message on the Publication of the $English Tripiṭaka $The Buddhist canon is said to contain eighty-four thousand different teachings. 
$I believe that this is because the Buddha’s basic approach was to prescribe a $different treatment for every spiritual ailment, much as a doctor prescribes a $different medicine for every medical ailment. 
Thus his teachings were always $appropriate for the particular suffering individual and for the time at which the $teaching was given, and over the ages not one of his prescriptions has failed to $relieve the suffering to which it was addressed. 
$Ever since the Buddha’s Great Demise over twenty-five hundred years ago, $his message of wisdom and compassion has spread throughout the world. 
Yet $no one has ever attempted to translate the entire Buddhist canon into English $throughout the history of Japan. 
It is my greatest wish to see this done and to $make the translations available to the many English-speaking people who have $never had the opportunity to learn about the Buddha’s teachings. 
$Of course, it would be impossible to translate all of the Buddha’s eighty-four $thousand teachings in a few years. 
I have, therefore, had one hundred thirty-nine $of the scriptural texts in the prodigious Taishō edition of the Chinese Buddhist $canon selected for inclusion in the First Series of this translation project. 
$It is in the nature of this undertaking that the results are bound to be criticized. 
$Nonetheless, I am convinced that unless someone takes it upon himself or herself $to initiate this project, it will never be done. 
At the same time, I hope that an $improved, revised edition will appear in the future. 
$It is most gratifying that, thanks to the efforts of more than a hundred Buddhist $scholars from the East and the West, this monumental project has finally gotten $off the ground. 
May the rays of the Wisdom of the Compassionate One reach $each and every person in the world. 
$ NUMATA Yehan $ Founder of the English $August 7, 1991 Tripiṭaka Project v$Editorial Foreword $In the long history of Buddhist transmission throughout East Asia, translations $of Buddhist texts were often carried out as national projects supported and $funded by emperors and political leaders. 
The BDK English Tripiṭaka project, $on the other hand, began as a result of the dream and commitment of one man. 
$In January 1982 Dr. 
NUMATA Yehan, founder of Bukkyō Dendō Kyōkai (Society $for the Promotion of Buddhism), initiated the monumental task of translating $the complete Taishō shinshū daizōkyō edition of the Chinese Tripiṭaka (Buddhist $canon) into the English language. 
Under his leadership, a special preparatory $committee was organized in April 1982. 
By July of the same year the Translation $Committee of the English Tripiṭaka was officially convened. 
$The initial Committee included the following members: (late) HANAYAMA$Shōyū (Chairperson), (late) BANDŌ Shōjun, (late) ISHIGAMI Zennō, (late) $KAMATA Shigeo, (late) KANAOKA Shūyū, MAYEDA Sengaku, (late) NARA$Yasuaki, (late) SAYEKI Shinkō, (late) SHIOIRI Ryōtatsu, (late) TAMARU Noriyoshi, $(late) TAMURA Kwansei, (late) URYŪZU Ryūshin, and (late) YUYAMA Akira. 
$Assistant members of the Committee were as follows: KANAZAWA Atsushi, $WATANABE Shōgo, Rolf Giebel of New Zealand, and Rudy Smet of Belgium. 
$After holding planning meetings on a monthly basis, the Committee selected $one hundred and thirty-nine texts for the First Series of the project, estimated $to be one hundred printed volumes in all. 
The texts selected were not limited to $those originally written in India but also included works composed in China $and Japan. 
While the publication of the First Series proceeds, the texts for the $Second Series will be selected from among the remaining works; this process $will continue until all the texts, in Japanese as well as in Chinese, have been $published. 
Given the huge scope of this project, accomplishing the English trans￾lations of all the Chinese and Japanese texts in the Taishō canon may take as $long as one hundred years or more. 
Nevertheless, as Dr. 
NUMATA wished, it is $the sincere hope of the Committee that this project will continue until completion, $even after all the present members have passed away. 
$vii$Editorial Foreword$Dr. 
NUMATA passed away on May 5, 1994, at the age of ninety-seven. 
He $entrusted his son, Mr. 
NUMATA Toshihide with the continuation and completion $of the English Tripiṭaka project. 
Mr. 
Numata served for twenty-three years, leading $the project forward with enormous progress before his sudden passing on February $16, 2017, at the age of eighty-four. 
The Committee previously lost its able and $devoted first Chairperson, Professor HANAYAMA Shōyū, on June 16, 1995, at $the age of sixty-three. 
In October 1995 the Committee elected Professor MAYEDA$Sengaku (then Vice President of Musashino Women’s College) as Chairperson, $and upon the retirement of Professor Mayeda in July 2016, the torch was passed $to me to serve as the third Chairperson. 
Despite these losses and changes we, the $Editorial Committee members, have renewed our determination to carry out the $noble ideals set by Dr. 
NUMATA. 
Present members of the Committee are Kenneth $K. 
Tanaka (Chairperson), MAYEDA Sengaku, ICHISHIMA Shōshin, KATSURA$Shōryū, MINOWA Kenryō, SAITŌ Akira, SHIMODA Masahiro, WATANABE$Shōgo, and YONEZAWA Yoshiyasu. 
$The Numata Center for Buddhist Translation and Research was established $in November 1984, in Berkeley, California, U.S.A., to assist in the publication $of the translated texts. 
The Publication Committee was organized at the Numata $Center in December 1991. 
In 2010, the Numata Center’s operations were merged $with Bukkyō Dendō Kyōkai America, Inc. 
(BDK America), and BDK America $continues to oversee the publication side of the English Tripiṭaka project in close $cooperation with the Editorial Committee in Tokyo. 
$At the time of this writing, in July 2017, the project has completed about sixty￾five percent of the seven thousand one hundred and eighty-five Taishō pages of $texts selected for the First Series. 
Much work still lies ahead of us but we are $committed to the completion of the remaining texts in order to realize the grand $vision of Dr. 
Numata, shared by Mr. 
Numata and Professor Hanayama, to make $the Buddhist canon more readily accessible to the English-speaking world. 
$ Kenneth K. 
Tanaka $ Chairperson $ Editorial Committee of $ the BDK English Tripiṭaka viii ix$Publisher’s Foreword $On behalf of the members of the Publication Committee, I am happy to present $this volume as the latest contribution to the BDK English Tripiṭaka Series. 
The $Publication Committee members have worked to ensure that this volume, as all $other volumes in the series, has gone through a rigorous process of editorial efforts. 
$The initial translation and editing of the Buddhist scriptures found in this $and other BDK English Tripiṭaka volumes are performed under the direction of $the Editorial Committee in Tokyo, Japan. 
Both the Editorial Committee in Tokyo $and the Publication Committee, headquartered in Moraga, California, are ded￾icated to the production of accurate and readable English translations of the $Buddhist canon. 
In doing so, the members of both committees and associated $staff work to honor the deep faith, spirit, and concern of the late Reverend Dr. 
$Yehan Numata, who founded the BDK English Tripiṭaka Series in order to dis￾seminate the Buddhist teachings throughout the world. 
$The long-term goal of our project is the translation and publication of the $texts in the one hundred-volume Taishō edition of the Chinese Buddhist canon, $along with a number of influential extracanonical Japanese Buddhist texts. 
The $list of texts selected for the First Series of this translation project may be found $at the end of each volume in the series. 
$As Chair of the Publication Committee, I am deeply honored to serve as the $fifth person in a post previously held by leading figures in the field of Buddhist $studies, most recently by my predecessor, John R. 
McRae. 
$In conclusion, I wish to thank the members of the Publication Committee for $their dedicated and expert work undertaken in the course of preparing this volume $for publication: Managing Editor Marianne Dresser, Dr.

The eventually resulting four-volume set is one of the $texts identified for translation for the BDK English Tripiṭaka (First Series). 
Vol￾ume I of this set appeared in 2013 and Volume II in 2018. 
The present third $installment covers fifty discourses found in Divisions 11 to 14 of the collection; $the remaining Divisions 15 to 18 will be published in Volume IV. 
$Discourse Parallels$Comparing the Madhyama-āgama version of a discourse with its parallel(s) in $the Pāli canon and elsewhere reveals varying degrees of closeness, as regards $both their essential message and the details of their wording. 
Such closeness is $the main criterion by which researchers identify discourse parallels; and because $there are varying degrees of closeness, researchers sometimes disagree in their $identifications. 
Further complicating the notion of parallels is the occasional $existence of “partial parallels,” cases where, for example, a certain Chinese dis￾course is matched by just one part of a Pāli discourse––or the converse of this $situation. 
In the endnotes to each volume and in the tables of parallels that will $appear in Volume IV such cases are marked with an asterisk (*). 
$What the phenomenon of discourse parallels signifies in terms of the historical $development of the texts remains a controversial question. 
A common interpretation $is that a given discourse and its parallel(s) are divergent descendants of what was $originally a single ancestral discourse; that is, that they are variously remembered $records of a teaching delivered on a certain occasion by the Buddha or one of $his immediate disciples. 
Wide geographical separation of monastic communities, $perhaps combined with translation into different dialects, could have eventually $led to the development of regional variants of imperfectly memorized oral texts. 
$xv$Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$In such ways the vicissitudes of oral transmission could have resulted in the split￾ting of a formerly unitary discourse into two or more related but distinct parallel $versions. 
This is probably an oversimplification; but despite such uncertainties, $there is no denying that comparison of discourse parallels is both a valuable aid $in translating difficult texts and a powerful tool in researching early Buddhism. 
$A good example is the last discourse in the present volume, the “Discourse $on Many Elements” (MĀ 181). 
It differs from its Pāli parallel, the Bahu dhātuka￾sutta (MN 115), which stipulates that a woman cannot be a buddha. 
Closer $inspection of the context makes it fair to conclude that the Madhyama-āgama discourse has preserved an earlier version of this exposition, when the notion $of what is impossible for a woman had not yet impacted this discourse; see $Bhikkhu Anālayo, Madhyama-āgama Studies (Taipei: Dharma Drum Publishing $Corporation, 2012), pp. 
249–288. 
Several other discourses in the Madhyama-$āgama offer similarly significant indications (a survey can be found in Bhikkhu $Anālayo, “Selected Madhyama-āgama Discourse Passages and Their Pāli Par￾allels,” Dharma Drum Journal of Buddhist Studies 19 [2016]: 1–61). 
This makes $it fruitful to consult the translations provided in this and the other volumes along￾side their Pāli counterparts. 
$For the convenience of researchers, relevant information on known discourse $parallels to the Madhyama-āgama is summarized in two tables (Tables 1 and 2, $compiled by Roderick S. 
Bucknell), which will be placed at the back of Volume $IV. 
These tables bring together the principal data on parallels contained in the $endnotes to the translations. 
Table 1 is designed for finding the Pāli parallel(s) $to a given Chinese Madhyama-āgama discourse; Table 2 is for finding the $Chinese Madhyama-āgama parallel(s) to a given Pāli discourse.

^ck The Discourse on Raṭṭhapāla1$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was traveling among the Kurus $together with a large company of monks. 
Having reached Thullakoṭṭhita, he $stayed in a rosewood grove north of Thullakoṭṭhita village. 
$At that time the brahmin householders of Thullakoṭṭhita heard this: $The renunciant Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who left the Sakyan clan $and went forth to train in the path, has been traveling among the Kurus $together with a large company of monks and, having reached Thullakoṭṭhita, $is staying in a rosewood grove north of Thullakoṭṭhita village. 
That renun￾ciant Gotama has great fame, being well known in the ten directions. 
The $renunciant Gotama is a tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened, $accomplished in knowledge and conduct, a well-gone one, a knower of $the world, an unsurpassable person, leader on the path of Dharma, teacher $of devas and human beings, called a buddha, an exalted one. 
$In this world with its devas, māras, Brahmās, renunciants, and brahmins, $from human beings to devas, he dwells having personally achieved under￾standing, awakening, and realization. 
He teaches the Dharma, which is $sublime in the beginning, sublime in the middle, and sublime in the end, $with its meaning and phrasing, endowed with purity, and he reveals the $holy life. 
If [one] visits the Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awak￾ened, reveres, pays respect, and offers support and honor to [him], then $one quickly obtains good benefits. 
We should go together to visit the renun￾ciant Gotama, to pay our respects and offer our support to [him]. 
$On hearing that, the brahmin householders of Thullakoṭṭhita, each accom￾panied by the members of his family group, went out of Thullakoṭṭhita and $3$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$headed north to a rosewood grove, wishing to visit the World-honored One, $to pay their respects and offer their support to him. 
Having approached the $Buddha, some of the brahmin householders of Thullakoṭṭhita paid homage $with their heads at the Buddha’s feet, stepped back, and sat to one side; some $exchanged greetings with the Buddha, then stepped back and sat to one side; $some extended their hands with joined palms toward the Buddha, then stepped $back and sat to one side; and some, having seen the Buddha from afar, sat $down silently. 
$At that time, when all of the brahmin householders of Thullakoṭṭhita were $seated, the Buddha taught them the Dharma, exhorted and encouraged them, $accomplishing their delight. 
Having taught them the Dharma with countless $skillful means, having exhorted and inspired them, fully delighting them, he $remained silent. 
Then, after the Buddha had taught them the Dharma, exhorted $and inspired them, fully delighting them, the brahmin householders of Thul￾lakoṭṭhita rose from their seats, paid homage with their heads at the Buddha’s $feet, circumambulated the Buddha three times, and left. 
$At that time there was present a young householder named Raṭṭhapāla, $who intentionally remained seated without rising. 
Then, soon after the brahmin $householders of Thullakoṭṭhita had left, the young householder Raṭṭhapāla $rose from his seat, arranged his clothes so as to bare one shoulder, extended $his hands with joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: $World-honored One, as I understand the Dharma taught by the Buddha, $if I live the home life, then I am chained with chains, unable to practice $the holy life in purity for my whole life. 
World-honored One, may I receive $from the World-honored One the going forth to train in the path, receive $the full ordination and become a monk, to practice the holy life in purity! $The World-honored One asked: $Young householder, have your parents allowed you to give up the house￾hold life out of faith in the true Dharma and discipline and become a $homeless one to train in the path? $The young householder Raṭṭhapāla said: $World-honored One, my parents have not yet allowed me to give up the $4^taisho623b Division 11$household life out of faith in the true Dharma and discipline and become $a homeless one to train in the path. 
$The World-honored One told him: $Young householder, if your parents have not allowed you to give up the $household life out of faith and become a homeless one to practice the path $in the true Dharma and discipline, then I cannot let you go forth to train $in the path, and also cannot give you the full ordination. 
$The young householder Raṭṭhapāla said: $World-honored One, I shall make effort in requesting this of my parents $and will certainly get them to allow me to give up the household life and, $out of faith in the true Dharma and discipline, become a homeless one to $train in the path. 
$The World-honored One told him, “Young householder, do as you wish.” $Thereupon the young householder Raṭṭhapāla, having heard what the $Buddha said, having received it well and kept it [in mind], paid homage with $his head at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and returned $home. 
$He said [to his parents]: $Honored [parents], as I understand the Dharma taught by the Buddha, if $I live the household life then I am chained with chains, unable to practice $the holy life in purity for my whole life. 
May my honored [parents] allow $me to give up the household life and, out of faith in the true Dharma and $discipline, become a homeless one to train in the path! $Raṭṭhapāla’s parents said: $Raṭṭhapāla, you are now our only son, whom we very much love and for $whom we have tender regard; our minds always delight in you and we $never get enough of seeing [you]. 
Even if you died, we would still not $want to give you up, let alone be separated from you while you are alive $and not see you [any longer]. 
$Three times the young householder Raṭṭhapāla said: $5^taisho623c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Honored [parents], as I understand the Dharma taught by the Buddha, if $I live the household life, then I am chained with chains, unable to practice $the holy life in purity for my whole life. 
May my honored [parents] allow $me to give up the household life and, out of faith in the true Dharma and $discipline, become a homeless one to train in the path! $And three times the parents of the young householder Raṭṭhapāla’s said: $Raṭṭhapāla, you are now our only son, whom we very much love and for $whom we have tender regard; our minds always delight in you and we $never get enough of seeing [you]. 
Even if you died, we would still not $want to give you up, let alone be separated from you while you are alive $and not see you [any longer]. 
$Then the young householder Raṭṭhapāla right away lay down on the ground $[and said]: $From now on I will not get up, neither drink nor eat, until my parents $allow me to give up the household life out of faith in the true Dharma and $discipline and become a homeless one to train in the path. 
$Then the young householder Raṭṭhapāla took no food for one day; for $two, three, four, several days he took no food. 
$At this the parents of the young householder Raṭṭhapāla went to their son $and said: $Raṭṭhapāla, you are very delicate, with a very fine body, and always [accus￾tomed to] sitting or lying on fine beds. 
Are you not feeling pain now? Get $up, Raṭṭhapāla! Quickly! Engage in sensual pleasures and in generous $giving! Joyfully practice meritorious deeds! Why is that? Raṭṭhapāla, [liv￾ing] conditions with the World-honored One are very difficult, very dif-$ficult. 
Going forth to train in the path is also very difficult. 
$At that time the young householder Raṭṭhapāla remained silent and did $not reply.2$At this the parents of the young householder Raṭṭhapāla went to his intimate $friends and attendants and said, “All of you together, come to Raṭṭhapāla $and persuade him to get up off the ground!” $6$Division 11$The young householder Raṭṭhapāla’s intimate friends and attendants went $together to Raṭṭhapāla and said: $Raṭṭhapāla, you are very delicate, with a very fine body, and always [accus￾tomed to] sitting or lying on fine beds. 
Are you not feeling pain now? Get $up, Raṭṭhapāla! Quickly! Engage in sensual pleasures and in generous $giving! Joyfully practice meritorious deeds! Why is that? Raṭṭhapāla, [liv￾ing] conditions with the World-honored One are very difficult, very dif-$ficult. 
Going forth to train in the path is also very difficult. 
$At that time the young householder Raṭṭhapāla remained silent and did $not reply. 
$Then the parents of the young householder Raṭṭhapāla went to his good $friends, companions, and contemporaries and said this, “All of you together, $come as a group to Raṭṭhapāla and persuade him to get up off the ground!”3$Then the young householder Raṭṭhapāla’s good friends, companions, and $contemporaries went together to Raṭṭhapāla and said: $Raṭṭhapāla, you are very delicate, with a very fine body, and always [accus￾tomed to] sitting or lying on fine beds. 
Are you not feeling pain now? Get $up, Raṭṭhapāla! Quickly! Engage in sensual pleasures and in generous $giving! Joyfully practice meritorious deeds! Why is that? Raṭṭhapāla, [liv￾ing] conditions with the World-honored One are very difficult, very dif-$ficult. 
Going forth to train in the path is also very difficult. 
$At that time the young householder Raṭṭhapāla remained silent and did $not reply. 
$At this the young householder Raṭṭhapāla’s good friends, companions, $and contemporaries went to the young householder Raṭṭhapāla’s parents $and said: $Allow Raṭṭhapāla to give up the household life out of faith, and to become $a homeless one to practice the path in the true Dharma and discipline! If $he delights in it, you can still meet each other in this life; if he does not $delight in it, he will certainly return of his own accord to his parents. 
If $you do not allow [him] now, he will certainly die, without doubt. 
Of what $benefit is that? $7^taisho624a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$On hearing this, the parents of the young householder Raṭṭhapāla told the $good friends, companions, and contemporaries of the young householder $Raṭṭhapāla: $We now allow Raṭṭhapāla to give up the household life out of faith in the $true Dharma and discipline and become a homeless one to train in the $path. 
When he has trained in the path, he must come back and visit [us]. 
$Then the good friends, companions, and contemporaries of the young $householder Raṭṭhapāla went together to Raṭṭhapāla and said: $Young householder, your parents allow you to give up the household life $out of faith in the true Dharma and discipline and become a homeless one $to practice the path. 
When you have finished training in the path, return $to visit your parents. 
$On hearing this, the young householder Raṭṭhapāla was very joyful; delight $and happiness arose in him. 
He got up off the ground and gradually nourished $his body. 
After his body had recovered, he went out of Thullakoṭṭhita and $went to where the Buddha was. 
He paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s $feet and said: $World-honored One, my parents have allowed me to give up the household $life out of faith in the true Dharma and discipline and become a homeless $one to train in the path. 
World-honored One, may I receive from the World￾honored One the going forth to train in the path, receive the full ordination, $and become a monk! $Then the World-honored One let the young householder Raṭṭhapāla go $forth to train in the path by giving him the full ordination. 
Having given him $the full ordination, [the Buddha,] after staying on for some time in Thul￾lakoṭṭhita, took his robes and bowl and went wandering. 
Traveling by stages, $he reached Sāvatthī and stayed in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
The $venerable Raṭṭhapāla, having gone forth to train in the path and having $received the full ordination, lived alone in a secluded place, practicing dili￾gently and with a mind that is without negligence. 
$Having lived alone in a secluded place, practicing diligently and with a $mind that is without negligence, [this] son of good family who had shaved $8$Division 11$off hair and beard, donned the yellow robe, left home out of faith, and gone 624b forth to practice the path, attained fully the summit of the holy life. 
He dwelled $having personally achieved understanding, awakening, and realization here $and now. 
He knew as it really is: “Birth has been ended, the holy life has $been established, what had to be done has been done. 
There will not be $another experiencing of existence.” The venerable Raṭṭhapāla, having under￾stood the Dharma ...
up to ...
had become an arahant. 
$Then, after having been an arahant for nine or ten years,4$ the venerable $Raṭṭhapāla thought, “Long ago I promised that, after going forth and training $in the path, I would return to visit my parents. 
Let me now return to keep $that promise of long ago.” $Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla approached the Buddha. 
Having paid homage $with his head at the Buddha’s feet, stepped back, and sat to one side, he said: $World-honored One, long ago I promised that after having gone forth and $trained in the path, I would return to see my parents. 
World-honored One, I $now ask leave to go and visit my parents and keep my promise of long ago. 
$At that time the World-honored One thought, “It is definitely not possible $that the clansman Raṭṭhapāla might abandon the precepts, cease practicing $the path, or indulge in sensual pleasures as before.” Knowing this, the World￾honored One told him: $Go and rescue those who have not yet been rescued, liberate those who $have not yet been liberated, [lead to] complete extinction those who have $not yet attained complete extinction!5$ Raṭṭhapāla, now do as you wish. 
$Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla, having heard what the Buddha said, $received it well and kept it well [in mind]. 
He rose from his seat, paid homage $with his head at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and $left. 
Going to his quarters, he stowed away his bedding, put on his robes, $took his bowl, and went wandering. 
Traveling in stages, he approached Thul￾lakoṭṭhita and stayed in a rosewood grove north of Thullakoṭṭhita village. 
$Then, when the night was over, at dawn, the venerable Raṭṭhapāla put $on his robes, took his bowl, and entered Thullakoṭṭhita to beg for almsfood. 
$The venerable Raṭṭhapāla thought, “The World-honored One praises begging $for almsfood in [uninterrupted] sequence. 
Let me now beg for almsfood in $9$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Thullakoṭṭhita in [uninterrupted] sequence.” Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla $begged for almsfood in Thullakoṭṭhita in [uninterrupted] sequence, and in $turn reached his former home. 
$At that time the venerable Raṭṭhapāla’s father was standing at the central $gate, dressing his hair and beard. 
The venerable Raṭṭhapāla’s father, seeing $the venerable Raṭṭhapāla coming in the distance, said: $These bald-pated renunciants are bound by [their own] darkness. 
They $have severed their lineage since they are without sons. 
They broke up our $family. 
We had only one son, whom we loved very much and for whom $we had tender regard. 
Our minds always delighted in him and we never $got enough of seeing him. 
[But] he was taken away by [one of you]. 
I will $not give you food. 
$The venerable Raṭṭhapāla received no alms at his own father’s house; he $got only abuse: $These bald-pated renunciants are bound by [their own] darkness. 
They $have severed their lineage since they are without sons. 
They broke up our $family. 
We had only one son, whom we loved very much and for whom $we had tender regard. 
Our minds always delighted in him and we never $got enough of seeing him. 
[But] he was taken away by [one of you]. 
I will $not give you food. 
$Having understood that, the venerable Raṭṭhapāla quickly went away. 
$At that time a maidservant in the household of the venerable Raṭṭhapāla’s $father was about to discard a basketful of smelly stale food and drink on a $garbage heap. 
The venerable Raṭṭhapāla, seeing that his father’s maidservant $was about to discard a basketful of smelly stale food and drink on a garbage $heap, said, “Sister, if this stale food and drink is of a nature to be discarded, $then put it into my bowl! I will eat it.” $Then the maidservant in the household of the venerable Raṭṭhapāla’s father $poured the smelly stale food and drink from the basket into the bowl. 
While $pouring it into the bowl, she recognized [Raṭṭhapāla] by noticing two of his $physical features, namely his voice and his hands and feet. 
Having noticed $these two features, she went to the venerable Raṭṭhapāla’s father and said,6$10^taisho624c Division 11$“Master, now you should know that your son, Master Raṭṭhapāla, has returned $here to Thullakoṭṭhita. 
Go and see him!” $On hearing that, the venerable Raṭṭhapāla’s father leapt up with great joy. 
$Gathering up his garments with his left hand and smoothing down his hair $and beard with his right hand, he hurried to the venerable Raṭṭhapāla. 
$At that time the venerable Raṭṭhapāla was [sitting] facing a wall and eating $the smelly stale food. 
The venerable Raṭṭhapāla’s father, seeing the venerable $Raṭṭhapāla [sitting] facing a wall and eating the smelly stale food, said: $Raṭṭhapāla, you are very delicate, with a very fine body, and you have $always had fine food. 
Raṭṭhapāla, why are you eating this smelly stale $food? Raṭṭhapāla, having come here to Thullakoṭṭhita, why can you not $return to your parents’ home? $The venerable Raṭṭhapāla replied: $Householder, I went to my father’s home, but got no alms. 
I got [only] $abuse: “These bald-pated renunciants are bound by [their own] darkness. 
$They have severed their lineage since they are without sons. 
They broke $up our family. 
We had only one son, whom we loved very much and for $whom we had tender regard. 
Our minds always delighted in him and we $never got enough of seeing him. 
[But] he was taken away by [one of you]. 
$I will not give you food.” On hearing this, I quickly went away. 
$The venerable Raṭṭhapāla’s father immediately apologized, saying: $Bear with me, Raṭṭhapāla! Bear with me, Raṭṭhapāla! I truly did not know $that it was you, Raṭṭhapāla, who had returned and come to his father’s $home.7$Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla’s father respectfully took Raṭṭhapāla by $the arm, led him inside, prepared a seat, and asked him to sit down. 
Then $the venerable Raṭṭhapāla sat down. 
$Then, seeing that the venerable Raṭṭhapāla was seated, the father $approached his wife and said, “Now, you should know that the clansman $Raṭṭhapāla has returned home. 
Quickly prepare food and drink!” $On hearing this, the venerable Raṭṭhapāla’s mother leapt up with great $joy and quickly prepared food and drinks. 
Having prepared food and drink, $11^taisho625a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$she quickly had coins brought out with a handcart and placed on the floor of $the central room. 
They were piled up in such a great heap that a person stand￾ing on one side could not see another person sitting on the other side. 
$Having made this great heap of coins, she approached the venerable $Raṭṭhapāla and said:8$ $Raṭṭhapāla, this is your mother’s part of the property; [besides this,] your $father’s property is immeasurable, countless hundreds and thousands of $it. 
All this we now hand over to you, Raṭṭhapāla. 
Abandon the precepts, $cease practicing the path, engage in sensual pleasures and generous giving, $and joyfully practice meritorious deeds! Why is that? [Living] conditions $with the World-honored One are very difficult, very difficult. 
Going forth $to train in the path is also very difficult. 
$The venerable Raṭṭhapāla said to his mother, “I would like to say something $now. 
Would you agree to listen to it?” $The venerable Raṭṭhapāla’s mother said, “Young householder, if you have $something to say, I will listen to it.” $The venerable Raṭṭhapāla said to his mother: $You should make new cloth bags, fill them with these coins, carry them $by cart to the Ganges River, and then pour them into it at a deep spot. 
$Why is that? Because of these coins people will be made to grieve, worry, $and weep. 
They will not attain happiness. 
$At this the venerable Raṭṭhapāla’s mother thought, “Since I cannot, by $this means, get my son Raṭṭhapāla to abandon the precepts and cease practicing $the path, let me approach his former wives and say this: $Daughters-in-law, decorate yourselves with the necklaces of jade and $pearls that you used to wear previously, which highly delighted the clans￾man Raṭṭhapāla in the past when he was living at home. 
Having quickly $decorated yourselves with these necklaces of jade and pearls, go together $to the clansman Raṭṭhapāla. 
Each of you clasp one of his feet and say this: $‘We are wondering what kind of heavenly maidens are so much better $than we are, that our worthy husband abandons us to practice the holy $life for their sake.’” $12$Division 11$Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla’s mother approached his former wives $and said: $Daughters-in-law, decorate yourselves with the necklaces of jade and $pearls that you used to wear previously, which highly delighted the clans￾man Raṭṭhapāla in the past when he was living at home. 
Having quickly $decorated yourselves with these necklaces of jade and pearls, go together $to the clansman Raṭṭhapāla. 
Each of you clasp one of his feet and say this: 625b$“We are wondering what kind of heavenly maidens are so much better $than we are, that our worthy husband abandons us to practice the holy $life for their sake.” $Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla’s former wives decorated themselves with $the necklaces of jade and pearls that they used to wear previously, which highly $delighted the clansman Raṭṭhapāla in the past when he was living at home. 
$Having decorated themselves with these necklaces of jade and pearls, they went $together to the clansman Raṭṭhapāla. 
Each clasped one of his feet and said this: $We are wondering what kind of heavenly maidens are so much better than $we are, that our worthy husband abandons us to practice the holy life for $their sake. 
$The venerable Raṭṭhapāla told his former wives: $Sisters, you should know that I did not practice the holy life for the sake $of heavenly maidens. 
The benefit of practicing the holy life has already $been attained. 
What has to be done according to the Buddha’s instruction $has now already been achieved.9$The venerable Raṭṭhapāla’s [former] wives stood back to one side. 
Weeping $and shedding tears, they said, “We are not our worthy husband’s sisters; yet $our worthy husband addresses us as ‘sisters.’” $Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla, turning his head to look at his parents, $said, “Householders, if food is to be offered, then let it be offered on time. 
$Why trouble one another?” $Then his parents rose from their seats and personally offered water for $washing. 
With their own hands they served various kinds of most delicious $13$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$dishes, making sure that there was enough to eat, savor, and digest. 
After the $meal was finished, the utensils had been cleared away, and water for washing $had been offered, [they] took a low seat and sat down to one side to listen $to the Dharma. 
The venerable Raṭṭhapāla taught his parents the Dharma, $exhorting and inspiring them, fully delighting them. 
Having with countless $skillful means taught them the Dharma, having exhorted and inspired them, $fully delighting them, the venerable Raṭṭhapāla rose from his seat, and uttered $these verses: $Behold this body adorned $With jewelry, necklaces of jade and pearls, $Entwined hair made to curl to the right, $Eyes and brows painted deep purple and black— $This deceives a fool, $But not one who is crossing to the farther shore. 
$Using fine silks of varied colors, $To adorn this smelly defiled body— $This deceives a fool, $But not one who is crossing to the farther shore. 
$Smearing the whole body with various perfumes, $Dyeing the feet yellow with orpiment— $This deceives a fool, $But not one who is crossing to the farther shore. 
$A body dressed in pure fine clothes, $Adorned like an illusion— $This deceives a fool, $But not one who is crossing to the farther shore. 
$Severed is the deer snare, $Destroyed the deer [trap] gate. 
$I have abandoned the bait and left. 
$Who would enjoy being in a deer’s trap? $Having uttered these verses, the venerable Raṭṭhapāla, using his super￾normal powers, rose into the air and left.10 Arriving at the Thullakoṭṭhita $14^taisho625c Division 11$forest, he entered the forest, spread his sitting mat beneath a terminalia tree $(vibhītaka), and sat down cross-legged. 
$At that time King Koravya was sitting in the main hall [of his palace], $surrounded by his courtiers. 
[Earlier he had] expressed his admiration and $praise for the venerable Raṭṭhapāla, saying, “If I were to hear that the clansman $Raṭṭhapāla had come here to Thullakoṭṭhita, I would certainly go to see him.” $Then King Koravya told a hunter, “Go and clean up the Thullakoṭṭhita forest. 
$I want to go out hunting.” Having received the order, the hunter went off to $clean up the Thullakoṭṭhita forest. 
Then while the hunter was cleaning up the $Thullakoṭṭhita forest, he saw the venerable Raṭṭhapāla, who had spread his $sitting mat beneath a terminalia tree and was sitting there cross-legged. 
He $thought, “The one who was admired and praised by King Koravya and his $courtiers when they were sitting together in the main hall is now already here.” $Then the hunter, after having cleaned up the Thullakoṭṭhita forest, returned $and approached King Koravya. 
He said: $Your Majesty should know that I have gone and cleaned up the Thul￾lakoṭṭhita forest according to Your Majesty’s wish. 
Before, when Your $Majesty was sitting together with the courtiers in the main hall, he $expressed his admiration and praise of the venerable Raṭṭhapāla, saying, $“If I were to hear that the clansman Raṭṭhapāla had come here to Thul￾lakoṭṭhita, I would certainly go to visit him.” The venerable Raṭṭhapāla, $the clansman, has spread his sitting mat beneath a terminalia tree in the $Thullakoṭṭhita forest and is now sitting [there] cross-legged. 
If Your $Majesty wishes to visit him, let him go there. 
$Hearing this, King Koravya told his charioteer, “Prepare the vehicles $quickly. 
I want to go now to see Raṭṭhapāla.” $The charioteer, having received the order, immediately prepared the vehi￾cles. 
That done, he returned and said, “Your Majesty should know that the $chariots have been prepared, according to Your Majesty’s wish.” Then King $Koravya mounted the chariot and went out toward the Thullakoṭṭhita forest. 
$Seeing the venerable Raṭṭhapāla from afar, he descended from his chariot $and approached the venerable Raṭṭhapāla on foot. 
$The venerable Raṭṭhapāla, seeing that King Koravya had come, said: $“Your Majesty has now come. 
Would you like to seat yourself?”11$15$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$King Koravya said: “Although I have now arrived at a place [that belongs] $to my own realm, still I would like the clansman Raṭṭhapāla to invite me to $sit down.” $Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla invited King Koravya, saying: “Now there $is a separate seat. 
May Your Majesty be seated.” $Then King Koravya exchanged greetings with the venerable Raṭṭhapāla, $stepped back, and sat to one side. 
He said to Raṭṭhapāla: $Did you go forth to train in the path because of some deterioration in your $household? If you went forth to train in the path because of some lack of $property, Raṭṭhapāla, since King Koravya’s household is endowed with $much property, I would give property to Raṭṭhapāla and persuade Raṭṭhapāla $to abandon the precepts, cease practicing the path, engage in sensual pleas￾ures and generous giving, and joyfully practice meritorious deeds. 
Why $is that? Raṭṭhapāla, because the teaching of your master is very difficult; $it is also very difficult to go forth to train in the path.12$The venerable Raṭṭhapāla, hearing that, said, “Your Majesty is now inviting $me with what is impure. 
He is not inviting me with what is pure.” $Hearing that, King Koravya asked, “How should I invite Raṭṭhapāla with $what is pure, not with what is impure?” $The venerable Raṭṭhapāla said: $Your Majesty could speak like this: “Raṭṭhapāla, the people of my country $are peaceful, happy, without fear, without conflict, without the thorn of $violence, without obligation to serve with hard labor, and there is abundant $rice, making it easy to beg for alms. 
Raṭṭhapāla, stay in my country; I will $protect you in accordance with the Dharma.” In this way Your Majesty $would be inviting me with what is pure, not with what is impure. 
$Hearing that, King Koravya said: $I now invite Raṭṭhapāla with what is pure, not with what is impure. 
The $people of my country are peaceful, happy, without fear, without conflict, $without the thorn of violence, without obligation to serve with hard labor, $and there is abundant rice, making it easy to beg for alms. 
Raṭṭhapāla, stay $in my country; I will protect you in accordance with the Dharma. 
$16^taisho626a Division 11$Again, Raṭṭhapāla, there are four kinds of deterioration. 
Because of one $or another of these [kinds of] deterioration, some people shave off hair and $beard, don the yellow robe, leave home out of faith, and go forth to train $in the path. 
What are the four? They are deterioration by disease, deterio￾ration by aging, deterioration of property, and deterioration of relatives.13$Raṭṭhapāla, what is deterioration by disease? Suppose there is a person $who has been ill for a long time with extremely severe pain. 
He thinks, $“I have been ill for a long time with extremely severe pain. 
I certainly $have sensual desires but I am unable to indulge in sensuality. 
Let me now $shave off hair and beard, don the yellow robe, leave home out of faith, $and go forth to train in the path.” Later, because of deterioration by disease, $he shaves off hair and beard, dons the yellow robe, leaves home out of $faith, and goes forth to train in the path. 
This is what is called deterioration $by disease.14$Raṭṭhapāla, what is deterioration by aging? Suppose there is a person $who is old with worn-out faculties, excessively aged, and nearing the end $of life. 
He thinks, “I am old with worn-out faculties, excessively aged, 626b and nearing the end of life. 
I certainly have sensual desire but I am unable $to indulge in sensuality. 
Let me now shave off hair and beard, don the $yellow robe, leave home out of faith, and go forth to train in the path.” $Later, because of deterioration by aging, he shaves off hair and beard, $dons the yellow robe, leaves home out of faith, and goes forth to train in $the path. 
This is what is called deterioration by aging. 
$Raṭṭhapāla, what is deterioration of property? Suppose there is a person $who is poor and powerless. 
He thinks, “I am poor and powerless. 
Let me $now shave off hair and beard, don the yellow robe, leave home out of faith, $and go forth to train in the path.” Later, because of deterioration of property, $he shaves off hair and beard, dons the yellow robe, leaves home out of faith, $and goes forth to train in the path. 
This is called deterioration of property. 
$Raṭṭhapāla, what is deterioration of relatives? Suppose there is a person $whose [family] lineage has been severed, whose relatives have died and $disappeared. 
He thinks, “My [family] lineage has been severed, my rel￾atives have died and disappeared. 
Let me now shave off hair and beard, $don the yellow robe, leave home out of faith, and go forth to train in the $17$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$path.” Later, because of deterioration of relatives, he shaves off hair and $beard, dons the yellow robe, leaves home out of faith, and goes forth to $train in the path. 
This is what is called deterioration of relatives. 
$Raṭṭhapāla [however,] was without disease in the past, at ease and com￾fortable. 
His digestion was balanced—neither too cold nor too hot, correctly $balanced and comfortable, all in order and without problems. 
Consequently, $he was able to digest and savor [food] at ease. 
It was not because of dete￾rioration by disease that Raṭṭhapāla shaved off hair and beard, donned the $yellow robe, left home out of faith, and went forth to train in the path. 
$In the past Raṭṭhapāla was a young lad, with pure black hair and a $strong body. 
At that time he entertained himself much with singing and $music, adorned his body, and always liked recreation. 
At that time none $of his relatives wanted to let him train in the path. 
His parents wept and $shed tears of grief and distress as they refused to allow him to go forth to $train in the path. 
Yet he shaved off hair and beard, donned the yellow robe, $left home out of faith, and went forth to train in the path. 
It was not because $of deterioration by aging that Raṭṭhapāla shaved off hair and beard, donned $the yellow robe, left home out of faith, and went forth to train in the path. 
$Raṭṭhapāla is from the foremost, the biggest, the best, the supreme $household with property in Thullakoṭṭhita. 
It was not because of deteri￾oration of property that Raṭṭhapāla shaved off hair and beard, donned the $yellow robe, left home out of faith, and went forth to train in the path. 
$Raṭṭhapāla has great and eminent relatives and clans living in Thul￾lakoṭṭhita and its forest [surroundings]. 
It was not because of deterioration $of relatives that Raṭṭhapāla shaved off hair and beard, donned the yellow $robe, left home out of faith, and went forth to train in the path. 
$Raṭṭhapāla, regarding these four kinds of deterioration, some people, $because of such deterioration, shave off hair and beard, don the yellow $robe, leave home out of faith, and go forth to train in the path. 
$I see Raṭṭhapāla as having been free of all these deteriorations that $could have caused him to shave off hair and beard, don the yellow robe, $leave home out of faith, and go forth to train in the path. 
Raṭṭhapāla, what $did you come to know and see, what did you hear, that [made] you shave $off hair and beard, don the yellow robe, leave home out of faith, and go $forth to train in the path? $18^taisho626c Division 11$The venerable Raṭṭhapāla answered: $Your Majesty, the World-honored One, the Tathāgata, free from attachment $and fully awakened, who sees and knows, teaches four things. 
It was after $I had accepted these [four],15 approved them, and delighted in them, after $I had known, seen, and heard them, that I shaved off hair and beard, donned $the yellow robe, left home out of faith, and went forth to train in the path. 
$What are the four? Your Majesty, they are these: $This world is without protection; there is nothing on which one $ can depend. 
$This entire world inclines toward aging. 
$This world is impermanent, and one will have to leave it. 
$This world is insufficient, unsatisfying, and driven by craving.16$King Koravya asked: $Raṭṭhapāla just said, “Your Majesty, this world is without protection; there $is nothing on which one can depend.” Raṭṭhapāla, I have sons and grand￾sons, brothers, and retainers; [I have] elephant troops, chariot troops, cav￾alry, and infantry, each able to shoot and drive, awe-inspiring, resolute, $and courageous. 
[I have] princes, mighty men, conquerors, great heroes; $I have diviners, strategists, calculators, scholars, and orators. 
I have $courtiers and attendants, memorizers, and knowers of charms. 
They accom￾pany me everywhere and are able to avert anything threatening.17$As to what Raṭṭhapāla just said—“Your Majesty, this world is without $protection; there is nothing on which one can depend”—Raṭṭhapāla, what $is the meaning of this? $Venerable Raṭṭhapāla answered, “I shall now ask Your Majesty [a question], $which he may answer according to his understanding. 
Does this body of your $majesty have any disease?” $King Koravya answered, “Raṭṭhapāla, my body now constantly has a dis￾ease related to wind.” $Venerable Raṭṭhapāla asked: $Your Majesty, when this disease related to wind manifests, if there is very $severe pain, is the king able to tell his sons, grandsons, and brothers; his $19$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$elephant troops, cavalry, chariot troops, and infantry, each of whom is $able to shoot and drive and is awe-inspiring, resolute, and courageous; $his princes, mighty men, conquerors, great heroes; his diviners, strategists, $calculators, scholars, and orators; his courtiers and attendants, memorizers $and knowers of charms, “Come, all of you, and relieve me of this very $severe pain! Make me free of disease and at ease!”? $King Koravya answered, “No. 
Why is that? This is due to my own [former] $deeds. 
Caused and conditioned by those deeds, I myself must experience the $severe pain alone.”18$The venerable Raṭṭhapāla said: $Your Majesty, it was on account of this that the World-honored One said, $“This world is without protection; there is nothing on which one can $depend.” I accepted this [teaching], approved it, and delighted in it. 
It was $after knowing, seeing, and hearing this that I shaved off hair and beard, $donned the yellow robe, left home out of faith, and went forth to train in $the path. 
$King Koravya said: $As to what Raṭṭhapāla said—“Your Majesty, this world is without pro￾tection; there is nothing on which one can depend”—Raṭṭhapāla, I too $accept it, approve it, and delight in it. 
Why is that? This world is indeed $without protection; there is nothing on which one can depend. 
$King Koravya asked further, “As to what Raṭṭhapāla said, ‘Your Majesty, $this entire world inclines toward aging.’ Again, Raṭṭhapāla, what is the $meaning of what you just said?” $The venerable Raṭṭhapāla answered: $Your Majesty, I shall now ask the king [a question], which he may answer $according to his understanding. 
Does Your Majesty consider that when $he was aged twenty-four or twenty-five, his speed at that time was as it $is now, that his physical strength, bodily figure, and complexion at that $time were as they are now? $King Koravya answered: $20^taisho627a Division 11$Raṭṭhapāla, I recall that when I was aged twenty-four or twenty-five, $nobody surpassed me in speed, physical strength, bodily physique, and $complexion. 
Raṭṭhapāla, I am now very old, with degenerated faculties, $excessively aged and near death, a full eighty years old, and [sometimes] $unable to get up [by myself]. 
$The venerable Raṭṭhapāla said: $Your Majesty, it was on account of this that the World-honored One said, $“This entire world inclines toward aging.” I accepted [this teaching], $approved it, and delighted in it. 
It was after knowing, seeing, and hearing $this that I shaved off hair and beard, donned the yellow robe, left home $out of faith, and went forth to train in the path. 
$King Koravya said: $As to what Raṭṭhapāla said—“Your Majesty, this entire world inclines $toward aging”—I too accept it, approve it, and delight in it. 
Why is that? $This entire world does indeed incline toward aging. 
$King Koravya asked further: $As to what Raṭṭhapāla said, “Your Majesty, this world is impermanent $and one will have to leave it.” Again, Raṭṭhapāla, what is the meaning of $what you just said? $The venerable Raṭṭhapāla said: $I shall now ask Your Majesty [a question], which he may answer according $to his understanding. 
Does Your Majesty possess the rich Kuru country, $along with a rich inner palace and a rich treasury? $King Koravya answered, “That is so.” $The venerable Raṭṭhapāla asked further: $Although Your Majesty possesses this rich Kuru country, along with a 627b rich inner palace and a rich treasury, there comes a time when such things $prove unreliable and one’s happiness is destroyed. 
The entire world $inevitably ends in death. 
At that time will Your Majesty be able to take $21$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$the rich Kuru country, the rich inner palace, and the rich treasury along $with him from this life into the next life? $King Koravya answered, “No. 
Why is that? I alone, without a second, $without any companion, will pass on from this life to the next life.”19$The venerable Raṭṭhapāla said: $Your Majesty, it was on account of this that the World-honored One said, $“This world is impermanent; one will have to leave it.” I accepted it, $approved it, and delighted in it. 
It was after knowing, seeing, and hearing $this that I shaved off hair and beard, donned the yellow robe, left home $out of faith, and went forth to train in the path. 
$King Koravya said: $As to what Raṭṭhapāla said—“Your Majesty, this world is impermanent; $one will have to leave it”—I too accept it, approve it, and delight in it. 
$Why is that? This world is indeed impermanent, and one will have to $leave it. 
$King Koravya asked further: $As to what Raṭṭhapāla said, “Your Majesty, this world is insufficient, $unsatisfying, and driven by craving.” Again, Raṭṭhapāla, what is the mean￾ing of what you said? $The venerable Raṭṭhapāla answered: $I shall now ask Your Majesty [a question], which he may answer according $to his understanding. 
Does Your Majesty possess the rich Kuru country, $a rich inner palace, and a rich treasury? $King Koravya answered, “That is so.” $The venerable Raṭṭhapāla asked further: $Although Your Majesty possesses the rich Kuru country, a rich inner $palace, and a rich treasury, suppose a person were to come from the east, $reliable and trustworthy, not one to deceive the world, and were to tell $the king, “I have come from the east and there I saw a country, great, rich, $and very populous. 
Your Majesty could acquire that country and its $22$Division 11$resources, people, and labor.” Would Your Majesty wish to acquire that $country and rule over it? $King Koravya answered: $Raṭṭhapāla, if I knew that there was such a rich country with its resources, $people, and labor, and that I could rule over its people, I would definitely $seize it. 
$[The venerable Raṭṭhapāla said:] $Suppose that, in the same way, a person were to come from the south, or $from the west, or from the north, or [even] from the other side of the great $ocean, reliable and trustworthy, not one to deceive the world, and were $to tell the king, “I have come from the other shore of the great ocean and $there I saw a country, great, rich, and very populous. 
Your Majesty could $acquire that country and its resources, people, and labor.” Would Your $Majesty wish to acquire that country and rule over it? $King Koravya answered: $Raṭṭhapāla, if I knew that there was such a rich country with its resources, $people, and labor, and that I could rule over its people, I would definitely 627c seize it. 
$The venerable Raṭṭhapāla said: $Your Majesty, it was on account of this that the World-honored One said, $“This world is insufficient, unsatisfying, and driven by craving.” I accepted $it, approved it, and delighted in it. 
It was after knowing, seeing, and hearing $this that I shaved off hair and beard, donned the yellow robe, left home $out of faith, and went forth to train in the path. 
$King Koravya said: $Raṭṭhapāla, as to what Raṭṭhapāla said—“Your Majesty, this world is insuf-$ficient, unsatisfying, and driven by craving”—I too accept it, approve it, $and delight in it. 
Why is that? This world is indeed insufficient, unsatisfying, $and driven by craving. 
$23$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$The venerable Raṭṭhapāla said: $Your Majesty, these four things were taught by the World-honored One, $the Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened, who sees and $knows. 
I accepted them, approved them, and delighted in them. 
It was after $I had known, seen, and heard them that I shaved off hair and beard, donned $the yellow robe, left home out of faith, and went forth to train in the path. 
$Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla uttered these verses: $I see people in the world $Who have property but foolishly do not give generously, $Having obtained property, they again seek even more. 
$Stingy and greedy, they accumulate property. 
$A king who has acquired the entire known world $And rules it according to his power, $Is not satisfied with [ruling only] on this side of the sea, $But further seeks [to rule] overseas. 
$For both king and people $Life ends before they have abandoned their desires. 
$With hair disheveled, their wives and children cry, $“Alas! Dukkha is hard to overcome!” $Wrapped in a shroud and buried, $Or cremated on a pile of firewood, $[People] pass on to the next life according to their deeds. 
$Cremated, they are without wisdom or mindfulness. 
$After death, their property does not follow them, $Nor do their wives, children, or servants. 
$For the poor and the rich it is the same; $For the foolish and the wise it is also thus. 
$The wise do not nurture grief; $Only the foolish harbor depression and worry. 
$Therefore, the wise are victorious, $Attaining the path to full awakening. 
$24$Division 11$Deeply attached to continued existence, $The foolish do evil deeds. 
$In regard to the Dharma, they act contrary to the Dharma, $Seizing from others by force. 
$One with little wisdom imitates others; $Being ignorant he does many evil deeds. 
$Going to a womb and into the next life, $He will repeatedly endure birth and death. 
$Having been born into this life, $And having done many evil deeds alone, $He is like a robber tied up by others, $Suffering for his own evil deeds. 
$Thus these sentient beings, $Passing on to the next life, $Suffer for their own deeds, $Harmed by the evil that they themselves have done. 
$It is just as fruit falls of itself when ripe; $[All people] young and old are like this. 
$They desire dignity and love happiness; $Their minds incline according to the beauty or ugliness of forms. 
$[The mind is] bound and harmed by sensual desire; $Because of sensual desire fear arises. 
$King, I have seen this and become awakened; $And I have understood the excellence of [the way of] the renunciant. 
$Thus spoke the venerable Raṭṭhapāla. 
Having heard what the venerable $Raṭṭhapāla said, King Koravya was delighted and received it respectfully.20$133. 
^ck The Discourse on Upāli21$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Nāḷandā in $Pāvārika’s Mango Grove. 
$At that time the Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin, who was wandering about in $the afternoon, approached the Buddha. 
After exchanging greetings, he stepped $25^taisho628a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$back and sat to one side. 
Then the World-honored One asked him, “Tapassin, $how many [types of] actions does the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta designate for not $performing evil actions, not doing evil actions?” $The Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin answered: $Gotama, my honored master, the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, does not designate $to us “[types] of actions” for not performing evil actions, not doing evil $actions; instead he designates to us “restraints” for not performing evil $actions, not doing evil actions.22$The World-honored One asked again, “Tapassin, how many restraints $does the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta designate for not performing evil actions, not $doing evil actions?” $The Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin answered: $Gotama, my honored master, the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, designates to us three $restraints for not performing evil actions, not doing evil actions. 
What are $the three? They are bodily restraint, verbal restraint, and mental restraint. 
$The World-honored One asked further, “Tapassin, do bodily restraint, $verbal restraint, and mental restraint differ from one another?” $The Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin answered, “Gotama, for us bodily restraint, $verbal restraint, and mental restraint do differ from one another.” $The World-honored One asked further: $Tapassin, of these three restraints like this, which restraint does the Nigaṇṭha $Nātaputta designate as the most serious one for not performing evil actions, $not doing evil actions: bodily restraint, verbal restraint, or mental restraint? $The Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin answered: $Gotama, of these three restraints like this, my honored master, the Nigaṇṭha $Nātaputta, designates bodily restraint as the most serious for not performing $evil actions, not doing evil actions. 
Verbal restraint is less serious; mental $restraint is the least serious, in contrast to bodily restraint, which is $extremely serious. 
$The World-honored One asked further, “Tapassin, did you say that bodily $restraint is the most serious one?” $26^taisho628b Division 11$The Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin answered, “Gotama, bodily restraint is the $most serious.” $The World-honored One asked a second and a third time, “Tapassin, did $you say that bodily restraint is the most serious one?” $The Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin also answered a second and a third time, $“Gotama, bodily restraint is the most serious one.” $Then the World-honored One, having thus three times ascertained the $standpoint of the Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin, remained silent. 
$The Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin asked, “How many restraints does the renun￾ciant Gotama designate for not performing evil actions, not doing evil $actions?” $Then the World-honored One answered: $Tapassin, I do not designate “restraints” for not performing evil actions, $not doing evil actions; instead I designate “actions” for not performing $evil actions, not doing evil actions. 
$The Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin asked, “How many actions does Gotama $designate for not performing evil actions, not doing evil actions?” $The World-honored One answered again: $Tapassin, I designate three actions for not performing evil actions, not $doing evil actions. 
What are the three? They are bodily action, verbal $action, and mental action. 
$The Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin asked, “Gotama, do bodily action, verbal $action, and mental action differ from one another?” $The World-honored One answered again, “Tapassin, to me, bodily action, $verbal action, and mental action do differ from one another.” $The Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin asked: $Gotama, of these three actions like this, which action do you designate $as the most serious one for not performing evil actions, not doing evil $actions: bodily action, verbal action, or mental action? $The World-honored One answered again: $Tapassin, of these three actions like this, I designate mental action as the $27$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$most serious one for not performing evil actions, not doing evil actions. 
$Bodily action and verbal action are not like that. 
$The Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin asked, “Gotama, you designate mental action $as the most serious one?” $The World-honored One answered again, “Tapassin, I designate mental $action as the most serious one.” $The Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin asked a second and a third time, “Gotama, $you designate mental action as the most serious one?” $The World-honored One answered a second and a third time, “Tapassin, $I designate mental action as the most serious one.” $Then the Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin, having three times ascertained the $standpoint of the World-honored One, rose from his seat, circumambulated $the World-honored One three times, and left. 
He approached the Nigaṇṭha $Nātaputta. 
$The Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, on seeing the Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin coming $in the distance, asked him, “Tapassin, where are you coming from?” $The Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin answered, “Honored One, I am coming from $Nāḷandā, Pāvārika’s Mango Grove, where the renunciant Gotama is stay￾ing.” $The Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta asked, “Tapassin, did you have any discussion $with the renunciant Gotama?” $The Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin answered, “We did have a discussion $together.” $The Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta said, “Tapassin, if you had a discussion with the $renunciant Gotama, tell me about it in full. 
Perhaps I can come to understand $what he proclaims.” $Then the Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin told him in full what he had discussed $with the World-honored One. 
After hearing it, the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta praised $him, saying: $It is well, Tapassin, in that you have performed a disciple’s duty toward $the master. 
What you did was to debate wisely, intelligently, and decisively. 
$You have achieved great mastery in argument with calmness and fear￾lessness. 
You have acquired the banner of ambrosia. 
You have personally $attained the realm of ambrosia and are abiding in it. 
$28^taisho628c Division 11$Why is that? Because you have, before the renunciant Gotama, desig￾nated bodily restraint as the most serious one for not performing evil $actions, not doing evil actions, verbal restraint as less serious, and mental $restraint as the least serious—in contrast to bodily restraint, which is $extremely serious. 
$At this time the householder Upāli was together with five hundred house￾holders who had gathered in the assembly. 
He extended his hands with joined $palms toward the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta. 
Then the householder Upāli said to $the Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin, “Honored one, you ascertained the standpoint $of the renunciant Gotama three times—is that so?” $The Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin answered, “Householder, I ascertained the $standpoint of the renunciant Gotama three times—that is so.” $The householder Upāli said to the Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin: $I too am able to ascertain the standpoint of the renunciant Gotama up to $three times, and having done so in this matter, drag him around at will. 
$Just as a strong man might seize a long-haired sheep and drag it around $at will, in the same way I will be able to ascertain the standpoint of the $renunciant Gotama up to three times and then drag him around at will. 
629a$Just as a strong man might take hold of a fur cloak with his hands and $shake it to remove any dust, in the same way I will be able to ascertain $the standpoint of the renunciant Gotama up to three times and then drag $him around at will.23$Just as a master brewer or his apprentice might put a brewing filter $deep into the water and drag it around at will, however he wishes, in the $same way I will be able to ascertain the standpoint of the renunciant $Gotama up to three times and then drag him around at will. 
$Just as a great royal elephant, fully sixty years old, a proud mahānāga, $with fully grown tusks, feet, and body, with abundant muscular strength $might be led away by a strong man who washes its hips, its back, its flanks, $its belly, its tusks, and its head with water, and makes it play in the water,24$in the same way I will be able to ascertain the standpoint of the renunciant $Gotama up to three times and then wash him around at will. 
I will approach $the renunciant Gotama and debate with him; and having defeated him, I $will come back here. 
$29$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$The Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta told the householder Upāli, “I too could defeat $the renunciant Gotama. 
You too could do it, and the Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin $too could do it.” $Then the Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin said to the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta: $I do not want to have the householder Upāli approach the renunciant $Gotama. 
Why is that? The renunciant Gotama knows a magic spell that $enables him to convert people so that they become his disciples as monks, $nuns, laymen, or laywomen. 
I fear that the householder Upāli might be $converted by the renunciant Gotama and become his disciple. 
$The Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta said: $Tapassin, it is impossible that the householder Upāli might be converted $by the renunciant Gotama and become his disciple. 
It is, however, certainly $possible that the renunciant Gotama might be converted by the householder $Upāli and become his disciple. 
$A second and a third time the householder Upāli said to the Nigaṇṭha $Nātaputta, “I will now approach the renunciant Gotama and debate with him $and, having defeated him, I will come back here.” $A second and a third time the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta answered, “You can $quickly go there. 
I too could defeat the renunciant Gotama. 
You too could $do it and the Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin too could do it.” $A second and a third time the Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin said: $I do not want to have the householder Upāli approach the renunciant $Gotama. 
Why is that? The renunciant Gotama knows a magic spell that $enables him to convert people so that they become his disciples as monks, $nuns, laymen, or laywomen. 
I fear that the householder Upāli might be $converted by the renunciant Gotama and become his disciple. 
$The Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta said: $Tapassin, it is impossible that the householder Upāli might be converted by $the renunciant Gotama to become his disciple. 
It is, however, certainly $possible that the renunciant Gotama might be converted by the householder $Upāli to become his disciple. 
Householder Upāli, go according to your wish! $30^taisho629b Division 11$Then the householder Upāli paid homage with his head at the feet of the $Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, circumambulated him three times, and left. 
He approached $the Buddha, exchanged greetings, stepped back, and sat to one side. 
He asked, $“Gotama, did the Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin come here today?” $The World-honored One answered, “He did, householder.” $The householder Upāli asked, “Gotama, did you have any discussion with $the Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin?” $The World-honored One answered, “Yes, there was some discussion.” $The householder Upāli said, “Gotama, if you tell me in full what you dis￾cussed with the Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin, perhaps I can understand it after $having heard it.” Then the World-honored One told him in full what he had $discussed with the Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin. 
$Then the householder Upāli, having heard this, expressed praise: $It is well that Tapassin has performed a disciple’s duty toward the master. 
$What he did was to debate wisely, intelligently, and decisively. 
He has $achieved great mastery in argument with calmness and fearlessness. 
He $has acquired the banner of ambrosia. 
He has attained the realm of ambrosia $and is abiding in it. 
Why is that? $Because he has, before the renunciant Gotama, designated bodily $restraint as the most serious one for not performing evil actions, not doing $evil actions, verbal restraint as less serious, and mental restraint as the $least serious—in contrast to bodily restraint, which is extremely serious. 
$Then the World-honored One said, “Householder, I am willing to discuss $this matter with you if you will take a stance on truth and answer according $to truth.” $The householder Upāli replied, “Gotama, I will take a stance on truth and $answer according to truth. 
Renunciant Gotama, you may feel free to discuss $this matter with me.” $The World-honored One asked: $Householder, what do you think? Suppose that a Nigaṇṭha comes by who $is fond of giving and delights in giving, who does not [engage in] merry￾making and delights in not [engaging in] merrymaking, who is of the highest $purity and highest performance in his vows, [yet] in going and coming he $31$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$kills many big and small insects.25 Householder, what result does the Nigaṇṭha $Nātaputta designate for this kind of killing of living beings? $The householder Upāli answered, “Gotama, if it is intentional, it is a great $offense; if it is unintentional, it is not a great offense.” $The World-honored One asked, “Householder, what do you mean by inten￾tion?” $The householder Upāli answered, “Gotama, I mean mental action.” $The World-honored One said: $Householder, you should answer only after consideration. 
Of what you $have said, the earlier disagrees with the latter, and the latter disagrees with $the earlier; they do not correspond. 
Householder, you yourself have pro￾claimed in this assembly, “Gotama, I will take a stance on truth and answer $according to truth. 
Renunciant Gotama, you may feel free to discuss this $matter with me.” $Householder, what do you think? Suppose that a Nigaṇṭha comes by $who drinks [only] boiled water and refuses unboiled water. 
When there $is no boiled water [available], he has a desire to drink unboiled water. 
Not $obtaining [even] unboiled water he dies.26 Householder, according to the $Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, where would this Nigaṇṭha be reborn? $The householder Upāli answered, “Gotama, there is a heaven called Mind $with Attachment. 
If the Nigaṇṭha died with attachment in his mind, he would $certainly be reborn there.” $The World-honored One said: $Householder, you should answer only after consideration. 
Of what you have $said, the earlier disagrees with the latter, and the latter disagrees with the $earlier; they do not correspond. 
You yourself have proclaimed in this assem￾bly, “Gotama, I will take a stance on truth and answer according to truth. 
$Renunciant Gotama, you may feel free to discuss this matter with me.” $Householder, what do you think? Suppose that a man comes by carrying $a sharp knife and he says, “In a single day I will chop, cut, split up, and $slice up all the living beings here in Nāḷandā to make one heap of flesh, to $make one pile of flesh.” Householder, what do you think? Would that man $32^taisho629c Division 11$be able, in a single day, to chop, cut, split up, and slice up all the living $beings here in Nāḷandā to make one heap of flesh, to make one pile of flesh? $The householder Upāli answered: $No, [he could not]. 
Why is that? This Nāḷandā is very large, flourishing, $and opulent, with many inhabitants. 
For this reason, that man would cer￾tainly not be able, in a single day, to chop, cut, split up, and slice up all $the living beings here in Nāḷandā to make one heap of flesh, to make one $pile of flesh. 
Gotama, that man would be making a great deal of trouble $for himself in vain. 
$[The World-honored One said:] $Householder, what do you think? Suppose that a renunciant or a brahmin $comes by who is endowed with great bases of supernormal power, great $power, great merit, great might, who has attained mastery of the mind, $and he says, “I shall burn this entire Nāḷandā to ashes by sending out one $thought of hatred.” Householder, what do you think? Would that renunciant $or brahmin be able to burn this entire Nāḷandā to ashes? $The householder Upāli answered: $Gotama, not just one Nāḷandā; not just two, three, or four [Nāḷandās]. 
$Gotama, since that renunciant or brahmin is endowed with great bases of $supernormal power, great power, great merit, great might, and has attained $mastery of the mind, if he sent out one thought of hatred, he could burn $entire countries and entire populations to ashes. 
What, then, of one Nāḷandā? 630a$The World-honored One said: $Householder, you should answer only after due consideration. 
Of what $you have said, the earlier disagrees with the latter, and the latter disagrees $with the earlier; they do not correspond. 
You yourself have proclaimed $in this assembly, “Gotama, I will take a stance on truth and answer accord￾ing to truth. 
Renunciant Gotama, you may feel free to discuss this matter $with me.” $The World-honored One asked: $33$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Householder, have you heard how certain forests became forests, namely $the Great Marshy Forest, the Unicorn Forest, the Deer Forest, the Tranquil $Forest, and the Empty Field Forest?27$The householder Upāli answered, “Gotama, I have heard about that.” $[The World-honored One said:] $Householder, what do you think? Who made those forests become forests, $namely the Great Marshy Forest, the Unicorn Forest, the Deer Forest, the $Tranquil Forest, and the Empty Field Forest? $The householder Upāli remained silent.28 The World-honored One said: $Householder, answer quickly! Householder, answer quickly! Now is not $the time for silence. 
Householder, you yourself proclaimed in this assembly, $“Gotama, I will take a stance on truth and answer according to truth. 
$Renunciant Gotama, you may feel free to discuss this matter with me.” $Then the householder Upāli, after remaining silent for a while, replied: $Gotama, I was not just keeping silence; I was thinking about this matter. 
$Gotama, the foolish Nigaṇṭhas do not clearly understand; they are not able $to realize; they do not recognize what is a fertile field; they do not examine $themselves. 
They have cheated me for a long time. 
I have been misled by $them into proclaiming before the renunciant Gotama that bodily restraint $is the most serious one for not performing evil actions, not doing evil $actions, and that verbal restraint and mental restraint cannot match it. 
$As I understand the meaning, from what the renunciant Gotama has $said, [it is not the case that bodily restraint is more serious, since] a seer $sending out a thought of hatred is what made those forests become forests, $namely the Great Marshy Forest, the Unicorn Forest, the Deer Forest, the $Tranquil Forest, and the Empty Field Forest.29$World-honored One, I have come to know. 
Well-gone One, I have $understood. 
I now personally take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and $the Sangha of monks. 
May the World-honored One receive me as a lay $disciple, from this day forth, until life ends. 
I personally take refuge for $my whole life. 
$34$Division 11$The World-honored One said, “Householder, you had better keep quiet $and not announce it. 
For a highly placed person like yourself it is good to $keep quiet.”30$The householder Upāli said: $World-honored One, because of this, I am even more delighted and pleased $with the World-honored One. 
Why is that? Because the World-honored One $speaks like this: “Householder, you had better keep quiet and not announce $it. 
For a highly placed person like yourself it is good to keep quiet.” $World-honored One, if I were to become a disciple of another renunciant $or brahmin, they would take flags, banners, and parasols and parade all 630b around Nāḷandā announcing, “The householder Upāli has become a disciple $of mine! The householder Upāli has become a disciple of mine!” Yet the $World-honored One speaks like this: “Householder, you had better keep $quiet and not announce it. 
For a highly placed person like yourself it is $good to keep quiet.” $The householder Upāli said: $World-honored One, from this day forth I will not allow Nigaṇṭhas to $enter my house. 
I will allow only the four assemblies of disciples of the $World-honored One to enter, that is, monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. 
$The World-honored One said: $Householder, the Nigaṇṭhas have been respected by all in your household $for a long time. 
If they come, you should support them according to your $ability. 
$The householder Upāli said: $World-honored One, because of this, I am even more delighted and pleased $with the World-honored One. 
Why is that? Because the World-honored $One speaks like this: “Householder, those Nigaṇṭhas have been respected $by all in your household for a long time. 
If they come, you should support $them according to your ability.” $World-honored One, earlier I heard a report that the World-honored $One speaks like this: “You should give alms to me; do not give alms to $35$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$others! You should give alms to my disciples; do not give alms to others’ $disciples! If you give alms to me, you will receive great merit; if you give $alms to others, you will not receive great merit. 
If you give alms to my $disciples, you will receive great merit; if you give alms to others’ disciples, $you will not receive great merit.” $The World-honored One said:31 $Householder, I do not speak like this: “You should give alms to me; do $not give alms to others! You should give alms to my disciples; do not give $alms to others’ disciples! If you give alms to me, you will receive great $merit; if you give alms to others, you will not receive great merit. 
If you $give alms to my disciples, you will receive great merit; if you give alms $to others’ disciples, you will not receive great merit.” Householder, I speak $like this: “You should give alms to all people according as your mind $delights. 
However, if you give alms to those who do not practice diligently, $you will not receive great merit; if you give alms to those who do practice $diligently, you will receive great merit.” $The householder Upāli said: $World-honored One, I wish to be independent. 
I myself will know whether $I should give alms to Nigaṇṭhas or not give alms to Nigaṇṭhas. 
World￾honored One, I now again personally take refuge in the Buddha, the $Dharma, and the Sangha of monks. 
May the World-honored One receive $me as a lay disciple from this day forth until life ends. 
I personally take $refuge for my whole life. 
$Then the World-honored One taught the Dharma to the householder Upāli, $to exhort and inspire him, fully delighting him. 
Having taught him the Dharma $with countless skillful means, having exhorted and inspired him, fully delight￾ing him, he did as all buddhas do when they first give instruction in the proper $and true Dharma to gladden their listeners. 
That is, he spoke about generosity, $he spoke about moral discipline, and he spoke about the conditions for rebirth $in heaven; he warned of the dangers in sensual desire and the defilements in $birth and death; and he praised the sublime nature of dispassion and the purity $of the requisites of awakening. 
The World-honored One taught him such $teachings. 
$36^taisho630c Division 11$[Then] the Buddha knew that his mind had become gladdened, contented, $malleable, receptive, uplifted, concentrated, free from doubt, and free from $the hindrances, [and that he had] the ability and power to receive the true $Dharma, that is, the essential teaching of all buddhas. 
Then the World-honored $One taught him the [truths of] dukkha, of its arising, of its cessation, and of $the path [leading to its cessation]. 
$Then the householder Upāli, as he sat there, immediately saw the four $noble truths of dukkha, its arising, its cessation, and the path [leading to its $cessation]. 
Just as white silk is easily dyed with colors, in the same way the $householder Upāli, as he sat there, immediately saw the four noble truths of $dukkha, its arising, its cessation, and the path [leading to its cessation]. 
$Thereupon the householder Upāli saw the Dharma, attained the Dharma, $realized the pure white Dharma. 
He discarded doubt and overcame perplexity; $[henceforth] he would venerate no other [teacher], would no longer follow $others. 
He was without uncertainty, having attained the fruit of realization $and attained unshakability in the Dharma of the World-honored One. 
$Then he rose from his seat, paid homage to the Buddha [and said]: $World-honored One, now for the third time I personally take refuge in $the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha of monks. 
May the World-hon￾ored One receive me as a lay disciple, from this day forth until life ends. 
$I personally take refuge for my whole life. 
$Then the householder Upāli, having heard what the Buddha said, received $it well and kept it well [in mind]. 
He paid homage with his head at the $Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and returned [home]. 
He $gave orders to his gatekeeper: $You should know that I am now a disciple of the World-honored One. 
$From now on, when Nigaṇṭhas come, do not allow them to enter the gate. 
$Allow only the four assemblies of disciples of the World-honored One to $enter; that is, monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. 
$If a Nigaṇṭha comes, you should tell him, “Venerable Sir, the house￾holder Upāli has been converted by the Buddha and is now his disciple. 
$He does not allow Nigaṇṭhas to enter the gate; he allows only the four $assemblies of disciples of the World-honored One to enter: monks, nuns, $37$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$laymen, and laywomen. 
If you need food, then stand here and food will $be brought out to you.” $Then the Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin heard that the householder Upāli had $been converted by the renunciant Gotama and become a disciple and that he $was therefore not allowing Nigaṇṭhas to enter the gate, but allowing only $the four assemblies of disciples of the renunciant Gotama to enter, that is $monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. 
Having heard this, the Nigaṇṭha Dīgha -$ta passin approached the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and said, “Honored One, this $is as I said earlier.” $The Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta asked, “Tapassin, what did you say earlier?”32$The Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin answered: $Honored One, earlier I said, “I do not want to have the householder Upāli $approach the renunciant Gotama. 
Why is that? The renunciant Gotama $knows a magic spell that enables him to convert people so that they become $his disciples as monks, nuns, laymen, or laywomen. 
I fear that the house￾holder Upāli might be converted by the renunciant Gotama and become $his disciple.” $Honored One, the householder Upāli has now been converted by the $renunciant Gotama. 
Having been converted and become a disciple, he $does not allow Nigaṇṭhas to enter his gate, allowing only the four assem￾blies of disciples of the renunciant Gotama to enter: monks, nuns, laymen, $and laywomen. 
$The Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta said: $Tapassin, it is impossible that the householder Upāli might be converted $by the renunciant Gotama and become his disciple; it is, however, certainly $possible that the renunciant Gotama might be converted by the householder $Upāli and become his disciple.33$The Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin spoke again, “If the Honored One does not $believe what I have said, then let the Honored One go himself or dispatch a $messenger.”34$Then, the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta said: $Tapassin, you yourself go and see whether the householder Upāli has been $38^taisho631a Division 11$converted by the renunciant Gotama and become his disciple, or whether $the renunciant Gotama has been converted by the householder Upāli and $become his disciple. 
$Having received this instruction from the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, the Nigaṇṭha $Dīghatapassin approached the house of the householder Upāli. 
The gatekeeper $saw the Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin coming in the distance and said: $Venerable one, the householder Upāli has been converted by the Buddha $and is now his disciple. 
He therefore does not allow Nigaṇṭhas to enter $the gate, allowing only the four assemblies of disciples of the World-hon￾ored One to enter, that is, monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. 
If you $wish to receive food, then stand here and food will be brought out to you. 
$The Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin said, “Gatekeeper, I do not need food.” $The Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin, knowing this, raised his head and left. 
He $approached the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and said, “Honored One, it is as I said $earlier.” $The Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta asked, “Tapassin, what did you say earlier?” $The Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin answered: $Honored One, earlier I said, “I do not wish to have the householder Upāli $approach the renunciant Gotama. 
Why is that? The renunciant Gotama $knows a magic spell that enables him to convert people so that they become $his disciples as monks, nuns, laymen, or laywomen. 
I fear that the house￾holder Upāli might be converted by the renunciant Gotama and become $his disciple.” $Honored One, the householder Upāli has now been converted by the $renunciant Gotama. 
Having been converted and become his disciple, he 631b does not allow Nigaṇṭhas to enter the gate. 
He allows only the four assem￾blies of disciples of the renunciant Gotama to enter: monks, nuns, laymen, $and laywomen. 
$The Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta said: $Tapassin, it is impossible that the householder Upāli might be converted $by the renunciant Gotama and become his disciple; it is, however, certainly $39$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$possible that the renunciant Gotama might be converted by the householder $Upāli and become his disciple. 
$The Nigaṇṭha Dīghatapassin said, “If the Honored One does not believe $what I have said, then let the Honored One go there himself.” $Then the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, together with a large company of five hun￾dred Nigaṇṭhas, approached the house of the householder Upāli. 
The gate￾keeper saw the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, together with a large company of five $hundred Nigaṇṭhas, coming in the distance and said: $Venerable one, the householder Upāli has been converted by the Buddha $and become his disciple. 
He therefore does not allow Nigaṇṭhas to enter $the gate, allowing only the four assemblies of disciples of the World-hon￾ored One to enter, that is, monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. 
If you $wish to receive food, then stand here and food will be brought out to you. 
$The Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta said, “Gatekeeper, I do not need food, but I wish $to see the householder Upāli.” $The gatekeeper said, “May the Honored One stand here. 
I will go in now $and tell the honorable householder, honorable Upāli.” $Then the gatekeeper went in and said: $Householder, you should know that the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, together with $a large company of five hundred Nigaṇṭhas, is standing outside the gate. 
$He says, “I wish to see the householder Upāli.” $The householder Upāli told the gatekeeper, “Go to the central gate and $prepare seats. 
That done, come back and tell me.” $Having received this instruction, the gatekeeper went to the central gate. 
$Having prepared seats, he returned and said, “Householder, you should know $that the seats have been prepared. 
May the householder himself know the $[right] time.” $The householder Upāli went to the central gate followed by the gatekeeper. 
$There was a seat, very high and broad, very clean and nicely prepared, which $the householder Upāli formerly used to offer to the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta to sit $on.35 The householder Upāli took it himself and sat down cross-legged. 
He $told the gatekeeper, “Go out to the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and say this: ‘Honored $40$Division 11$One, the householder Upāli says that if the Honored One would like to enter, $then let him do as he wishes.’” $The gatekeeper, having received this instruction, went out to the Nigaṇṭha $Nātaputta and said, “Honored One, the householder Upāli says that if the $Honored One would like to enter, then let him do as he wishes.” Then, the 631c$Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, together with the large company of five hundred $Nigaṇṭhas, entered by the central gate. 
$The householder Upāli saw from afar the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta entering, $together with a large company of five hundred Nigaṇṭhas, and said, “Honored $One, there are seats. 
Sit where you like!” $The Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta said: $Householder, is it appropriate for you to mount to a high seat, sit down $cross-legged, and speak to others as if you were no less than one who has $gone forth to train in the path?36$The householder Upāli said: $Honored One, these are my possessions. 
If I want to give, I give; if I do $not want to give, I do not give. 
Because the seats are mine, I speak like $this: “There are seats. 
Sit where you like!” $The Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta sat on a prepared seat and said: $Householder, what is the reason for this? You wanted to defeat the renunciant $Gotama, but instead you yourself have been defeated. 
You are just like a $person who goes into the forest in search of “eyes” (myrobalan fruit), but $returns having lost his [own] eyes.37 In the same way, householder, you $wanted to defeat the renunciant Gotama, but instead you yourself have been $defeated by the renunciant Gotama. 
You are just like a person who goes $into a pool because he is thirsty, but instead returns still thirsty. 
In the same $way, householder, you wanted to defeat the renunciant Gotama, but instead $you yourself return defeated. 
Householder, what is the reason for this?38$The householder Upāli said: $Honored One, allow me to speak a simile. 
A wise man, on hearing a simile, $understands its implications. 
Honored One, there was once a brahmin with $41$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$a young wife. 
The wife was pregnant, and she told her husband, “Sir, I am $now pregnant. 
Go to the market and buy a nice plaything for the child!” $Then the brahmin said to his wife, “Let us just hope that you have a $safe delivery. 
Why worry about having no [plaything right now]? If you $give birth to a boy, I will buy a boy’s plaything for you. 
If you give birth $to a girl, I will buy a girl’s plaything for you.” The wife told her husband $three times, “Sir, I am now pregnant. 
Quickly, go to the market and buy $a nice plaything for the child!” The brahmin also told his wife a second $and a third time, “Let us just hope that you have a safe delivery. 
Why $worry about having no [plaything right now]? If you give birth to a boy, $I will buy a boy’s plaything for him. 
If you give birth to a girl, I will buy $a girl’s plaything for her.” $The brahmin, being very fond of his wife, asked, “What kind of play￾thing do you want me to buy for the child?” His wife answered, “Sir, go $and buy a monkey as a nice plaything for the child.” On hearing that, the $brahmin went to the market to buy a monkey as a plaything, brought it $back, and told his wife, “I have come back after buying a monkey as a $plaything for the child.” $His wife, on seeing [the monkey], disliked the color, [finding it] unat￾tractive. 
Then she told her husband, “Sir, take this monkey plaything to $a dyer and have him dye it yellow, so as to be very attractive, and have $him pound it so that it becomes shiny.” On hearing that, the brahmin $immediately took the monkey plaything to a dyer and said, “Dye this $monkey plaything a nice yellow color for me to make it very attractive $and pound it so that it becomes shiny!” Then the dyer said to the brahmin, $“I can dye the monkey plaything yellow and make it very attractive, but $I cannot make it become shiny by pounding it.” Then, the dyer recited $these verses:39$A monkey can endure being dyed, $But it cannot endure being pounded. 
$If pounded, it will die. 
$It simply cannot take a hammering. 
$This monkey is [just] a foul stinking bag $Full of impurities. 
$42^taisho632a Division 11$Honored One, you should know that what the Nigaṇṭhas proclaim is $also like this. 
It cannot endure questioning by others. 
It cannot take reflec￾tion and examination. 
It takes the dye of foolishness; it does not take the $dye of wisdom. 
$Honored One, listen again. 
It is just like a clean piece of Benares cloth. 
$The owner took it to that dyer and said, “Dye this cloth for me. 
Make it $a very nice color, make it very attractive. 
Also pound it thoroughly to $make it become shiny!” Then the dyer told the owner of the cloth, “This $cloth can be dyed, made to have a very nice color, made very attractive, $and it can also be pounded thoroughly and made to become shiny.” Then, $the dyer recited these verses: $Benares cloth like this, $White and clean, can endure being dyed. 
$On being pounded, it becomes soft, $Shiny, colorful, and increasingly attractive. 
$Honored One, you should know that what is proclaimed by tathāgatas, $those free from attachment and fully awakened, is also like this. 
It can $endure questioning by others, it can take reflection and examination. 
It $takes the dye of wisdom; it does not take the dye of foolishness. 
$The Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta said, “Householder, you have been converted by $the magic spell of the renunciant Gotama.” $The householder Upāli said: $Honored One, that magic spell is good; that magic spell is extremely good. 
$Honored One, that magic spell [will] lead my parents to obtain profit, benefit, $peace, and happiness for a long time; and it [will] lead my wife, my servants, $my employees, the king of Nāḷandā, and the entire world with its devas, $māras, Brahmās, renunciants and brahmins, from human beings to devas, $to obtain profit, benefit, peace, and happiness for a long time. 
$The Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta said, “Householder, all the people of Nāḷandā$know that the householder Upāli is a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas. 
Whose disciple $is he now?” $Then the householder Upāli rose from his seat, placed his right knee on $43^taisho632b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$the ground, extended his hands with palms together in the direction of the $Buddha, and said: $Honored One, please listen to what I shall say. 
$Mighty and powerful, free from ignorance, $Having abandoned the defilements and subdued them totally; $Without opponents, [engaging] in subtle reflection, $Having practiced moral discipline, meditative concentration, and wisdom; $At peace and without defilement— $[Such is] the Buddha, whose disciple is Upāli. 
$A great noble one who has completed the practice, $And attained virtue and mastery in teaching; $Well [established] in mindfulness, with subtle right contemplation, $Not [judging] as high or low; $Imperturbable, always at ease— $[Such is] the Buddha, whose disciple is Upāli. 
$Free from distortion, always contented, $Having discarded stinginess and attained satisfaction; $A renunciant who has attained awakening, $[Bearing] his last body, to be honored as a Great Person; $Incomparable, free from the dust [of passion]— $[Such is] the Buddha, whose disciple is Upāli. 
$Free from disease, immeasurable, $Very profound, having become a seer; $Always at peace, courageous, $Abiding in the Dharma, with subtle reflection; $Tamed, happy without entertainment— $[Such is] the Buddha, whose disciple is Upāli. 
$A great nāga, happily abiding in a high position, $The fetters exhausted, liberation attained; $Appropriately eloquent in debate, pure, $With wisdom arisen, free from distress and grief; $The Sakyan, who will not return to this existence— $[Such is] the Buddha, whose disciple is Upāli. 
$44$Division 11$Having fared rightly, meditating and reflecting, $Without disturbance, pure; $Always smiling, without hatred, $Delighting in seclusion, having attained the highest; $Fearless, always focused on the essence— $[Such is] the Buddha, whose disciple is Upāli.

$With craving abandoned, incomparably awakened, $Without the “smoke,” without the “flame” of existence; $Thus gone is the Well-gone One, $Incomparable, without equal; $Named “Attainer of Perfection”— $[Such is] the Buddha, whose disciple is Upāli. 
$This is the Buddha [worthy of] a hundred praises,41$[With qualities] not previously contemplated; $When Upāli spoke [of them], $45^taisho632c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$The devas came to him, $To help him well and add eloquence, $In accordance with the Dharma and in accordance with his person. 
$To the question of the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, $[He replied, “I am] a disciple of the Buddha with ten powers.” $The Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta asked, “Householder, from what motive do you $praise the renunciant Gotama?” $The householder Upāli answered: $Honored One, allow me to speak a simile. 
On hearing a simile, a wise $person understands its implications. 
Just as a skilled garland maker or their $apprentice plucks various kinds of flowers and ties them with long strings $to make various kinds of garlands, in the same way, Honored One, the $Tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened, has innumerable titles $of praise. 
It is in order to honor him that I speak these praises. 
$When this teaching [by the Buddha] had been delivered, [the mind of] $the householder Upāli had become aloof from the dust of defilements, and $[in regard] to all phenomena the Dharma eye arose [in him]. 
The Nigaṇṭha $Nātaputta [however], vomited hot blood. 
He went to Pāvā where, because $of this serious affliction, he soon died.42$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the house￾holder Upāli was delighted and received it respectfully. 
$134. 
^ck The Discourse on the Questions $of Sakka43$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was dwelling in the Magadha $country, staying in the Indasāla cave on Mount Vediya, north of Mango Grove $village to the east of Rājagaha. 
$At that time Sakka, the ruler of the devas, heard that the Buddha was $dwelling in the Magadha country, staying in the Indasāla cave on Mount $Vediya, north of Mango Grove village in the Magadha country to the east of $Rājagaha. 
Then Sakka, the ruler of the devas, told the gandhabba Pañcasikha: $I have heard that the World-honored One is dwelling in the Magadha $country, staying in the Indasāla cave on Mount Vediya, north of Mango $46^taisho633a Division 11$Grove village in the Magadha country to the east of Rājagaha. 
Pañcasikha, $you come along with me to visit the Buddha. 
$The gandhabba Pañcasikha answered, “Very well.” Then the gandhabba$Pañcasikha, carrying a glazed lute, went together with Sakka, the ruler of $the devas. 
The devas of the Thirty-three heard that Sakka, the ruler of the devas, had again the wish to go and visit the Buddha; so the devas of the $Thirty-three also accompanied Sakka, the ruler of the devas. 
$Then, just as quickly as a strong man might flex his arm or stretch it out, $Sakka, the ruler of the devas, the devas of the Thirty-three, and the gandhabba$Pañcasikha suddenly vanished from the Heaven of the Thirty-three and reap￾peared at a place not far from the cave on Mount Vediya, north of Mango $Grove village, in the Magadha country to the east of Rājagaha. 
Then Mount $Vediya shone with a light as bright as fire. 
Seeing this, the people living $around the mountain thought, “Mount Vediya is on fire, burning everywhere.” $Then, having come to stay there at a certain place, Sakka, the ruler of the devas, said: $Pañcasikha, the World-honored One stays like this in secluded places, $under the trees in some mountain forest. 
He is happy to dwell on some $high mountain ridge, which is quiet, without sound, remote, without any￾thing bad and without people. 
There he sits in solitude at his ease, impres￾sive in his virtue. 
[We] devas have gathered here, enjoying his remoteness, $sitting peacefully in seclusion, and abiding in happiness. 
Since we have $not yet notified him, we should not go ahead directly. 
Pañcasikha, you $approach him first to notify him. 
After that we will move forward. 
$The gandhabba Pañcasikha answered, “Very well.” Then, the gandhabba$Pañcasikha, having received this instruction from Sakka, the ruler of the devas, took up his glazed lute and went ahead to the Indasāla cave. 
Then he $thought, “I know that this spot is neither too far from the Buddha nor too $near to him. 
Let the Buddha know I am here by hearing my voice!” Remaining $at that spot, he tuned his glazed lute and sang verses associated with desire, $verses associated with nāgas, verses associated with renunciants, and verses $associated with arahants. 
He sang these verses:44$Bhaddā, I pay homage to your parents: $47$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Moon and Timbaru. 
$They gave birth to you, the beautiful one $Who makes my heart rejoice. 
$Oppressed by heat, one seeks a cool breeze, $Thirsty, one desires to drink cold water. 
$Similarly I cherish you, $As an arahant cherishes the Dharma. 
$As difficult as gathering up spilled water— $Such is my clinging and desire $To be together [with you] for countless lifetimes, $As [a reward for past] offerings made to those free from attachment. 
$The pool has clear, cool water, $With golden grains of sand on the bottom. 
$Like an elephant oppressed by heat $Entering this pool to bathe, $Or like an elephant spurred on with a goad— $So has my mind surrendered to you. 
$You do not realize what I will do, $[If] I do not obtain you, graceful one. 
$My mind is so attached to you, $Impatience and discontent burn my heart. 
$Hence I am unhappy $Like a man in a tiger’s mouth. 
$Like the Sakyan son practicing meditation, $Constantly happy in [mental] unification. 
$Like a sage on attaining awakening, $Just as wonderful [for me] would it be to obtain you. 
$Just as a sage enjoys $The unsurpassable right awakening, $Similarly what I would enjoy $Is to obtain you, whom I constantly desire. 
$48^taisho633b Division 11$Like medicine, which a sick person desires to get, $Like food, which a hungry person desires to get, $Like water, which [can] extinguish a fire, $Are you, Bhaddā, who [could] calm my mind. 
$Whatever merit I have made $By offering to those free from attachment, $To all those who are superbly pure, $May you and I receive the reward! $I wish I could be with you until the end, $Never separated from you nor living alone.45$Let me die together with you, $Rather than live separated [from you]. 
$May Sakka, honored by the devas of the Thirty-three, $Grant me my wish! $You, the person I honor most, $Are my most constant wish. 
$Therefore I salute the Great Hero, $Bowing my head to the supreme human being, $Who has discarded all the thorns of craving. 
$I salute the Kinsman of the Sun (the Buddha). 
$At this the World-honored One rose from his meditative concentration $and praised the gandhabba Pañcasikha: $Well done! Well done, Pañcasikha! The sound of your singing was in har￾mony with the sound of your lute; and the sound of your lute was in har￾mony with the sound of your singing. 
The sound of your singing did not $go beyond the sound of your lute; and the sound of your lute did not go $beyond the sound of your singing. 
Pañcasikha, do you remember having $in the past recited these verses associated with desire, verses associated $with nāgas, verses associated with renunciants, and verses associated with $arahants? $The gandhabba Pañcasikha answered: $49$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$World-honored One, the Great Seer would know that himself. 
Great Seer, $in the distant past when the World-honored One had just attained the path $of awakening, he was dwelling at Uruvela, on the bank of the Nerañjarā$River, under the goatherds’ banyan tree. 
At that time the daughter of the gandhabba king Timbaru, named Bhaddā, was being courted by a deva named Sikha, a son of the royal charioteer Mātali. 
Great Seer, while he $was courting that girl, I too was courting a girl. 
However, Great Seer, I $was unable to obtain the girl I was courting. 
$At that time I stood behind the girl and sang the verses associated with $desire, the verses associated with nāgas, the verses associated with renun￾ciants, and the verses associated with arahants. 
Great Seer, when I sang $these verses, the girl turned around happily and, with a smile, told me, $“Pañcasikha, I have not yet seen the Buddha, the World-honored One. 
$However, I have heard from the devas of the Thirty-three that the World￾honored One is a tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened, perfect $in knowledge and conduct, a well-gone one, a knower of the world, an $unsurpassable person, a leader on the path of Dharma, a teacher of devas $and human beings, a buddha, an exalted one. 
Pañcasikha, if you are able $to praise the World-honored One frequently, I can go with you to pay $homage to the Great Seer. 
But I will meet with you only this once. 
After $that we will not meet again.” $At this point Sakka, the ruler of the devas, thought, “The gandhabba Pañ-$casikha has caused the World-honored One to emerge from his concentration, $enabling me to get through to the Well-gone One.” Then Sakka, the ruler of $the devas, said: $Pañcasikha, approach and in my name bow your head in homage at the $Buddha’s feet. 
Inquire from the World-honored One whether the Noble $One is healthy in body, whether he is at peace, happy, and without disease, $whether he is at ease, and whether his energy is as usual. 
Say this: “Great $Seer, Sakka, the ruler of the devas, pays homage at the Buddha’s feet, and $inquires from the World-honored One whether he is healthy in body, $whether he is at peace, happy, and without disease, whether he is at ease, $and whether his energy is as usual. 
Great Seer, Sakka, the ruler of the$50^taisho633c Division 11$devas, together with the Thirty-three devas would like to see the World￾honored One.” $The gandhabba Pañcasikha answered, “Very well.” $Then the gandhabba Pañcasikha put down his glazed lute, extended his $hands with joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: $World-honored One, Great Seer, Sakka, the ruler of the devas, pays homage $at the Buddha’s feet, and inquires from the World-honored One whether $the Noble One is healthy in body, whether he is at peace, happy, and with￾out disease, whether he is at ease, and whether his energy is as usual. 
$Great Seer, Sakka, the ruler of the devas, together with the Thirty-three￾devas, wishes to see the World-honored One. 
$Then the World-honored One said: $Pañcasikha, may Sakka, the ruler of the devas, be now at peace and happy, $and may all the devas, human beings, asuras, gandhabbas, yakkhas, as $well as the various other groups [of beings] be at peace and happy. 
Pañ-$casikha, if Sakka, the ruler of the devas, wishes to see me, then let him $do as he wishes. 
$Then the gandhabba Pañcasikha, having heard what the Buddha said, $received it well and kept it [in mind]. 
He paid homage with his head at the $Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and left. 
He approached $Sakka, the ruler of the devas, and told him, “Your Majesty, I have spoken on $your behalf with the World-honored One. 
The World-honored One is now 634a waiting for Your Majesty. 
May Your Majesty know the right time.” $Thereupon, Sakka, the ruler of the devas, along with the devas of the $Thirty-three and the gandhabba Pañcasikha, approached the Buddha. 
Then $Sakka, the ruler of the devas, paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s $feet and announced his name three times, “Indeed, Great Seer, I am Sakka, $the ruler of the devas; I am Sakka, the ruler of the devas.” $Then the World-honored One said, “It is like this, Kosiya, it is like this. 
$You are Sakka, the ruler of the devas.” $Then Sakka, the ruler of the devas, having announced his name three $times, paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet, stepped back, and $51$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$stood to one side. 
The devas of the Thirty-three and the gandhabba Pañcasikha $also paid homage with their heads at the Buddha’s feet, stepped back, and $stood to one side. 
Then Sakka, the ruler of the devas, said, “Great Seer, how $far away should I sit from the World-honored One?” $The World-honored One said, “You may sit near to me. 
Why is that? $Because you have a large retinue of divine retainers.” Then Sakka, the ruler $of the devas, paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet, stepped back, $and sat to one side. 
The devas of the Thirty-three and the gandhabba Pañca -$sikha also paid homage with their heads at the Buddha’s feet, stepped back, $and sat to one side. 
At that time the Indasāla cave suddenly became wider. 
$Why was that? It happened owing to the majesty of the Buddha and the power $of the devas. 
$Then Sakka, the ruler of the devas, having sat down, said: $Great Seer, for a long time I have wanted to visit the World-honored One, $wanting to ask questions about the Dharma. 
Great Seer, once in the distant $past the World-honored One was dwelling at Sāvatthī, staying in a cave. 
$Great Seer, at that time, on account of myself and the devas of the Thirty￾three, a chariot drawn by a thousand elephants was being driven toward $the dwelling of the Great [Heavenly] King Vessavaṇa. 
$At that time there was a concubine named Bhuñjatī in the household $of King Vessavaṇa. 
At that time the World-honored One had entered quiet $meditative concentration. 
The concubine was extending her hands with $joined palms in reverence toward the feet of the World-honored One. 
$Great Seer, I told her, “Sister, now is not the right time for me to visit $the World-honored One, [since] the World-honored One has entered med￾itative concentration.46 Sister, when the World-honored One emerges from $meditative concentration, pay homage in my name at the Buddha’s feet $and inquire from the World-honored One whether the Noble One is healthy $in body, whether he is at peace, happy, and without disease, whether he $is at ease, and whether his energy is as usual. 
Say this: ‘Great Seer, Sakka, $the ruler of the devas, pays homage at the Buddha’s feet, and inquires of $the World-honored One whether he is healthy in body, whether he is at $peace, happy, and without disease, whether he is at ease, and whether his $energy is as usual.’” $52$Division 11$Great Seer, did that sister pay homage in my name at the Buddha’s feet $and greet the World-honored One? Does the World-honored One remember $that? $The World-honored One said: $Kosiya, I do remember that sister paying homage with her head at my $feet in your name and greeting me as you had intended. 
Kosiya, I also $remember hearing the noise made at the time of your departure, which $roused me from my meditative concentration. 
$[Sakka said:] $Great Seer, in the distant past I heard that when there appears in the world $a tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened, accomplished in knowl￾edge and conduct, a well-gone one, a knower of the world, an unsurpassable 634b person, a leader on the path of Dharma, a teacher of devas and human $beings, called a buddha, an exalted one, at that time the devas increase $[in number], and the asuras decrease. 
$Great Seer, with my own eyes I have seen disciples of the World-hon￾ored One, and monks who had followed the World-honored One and prac￾ticed the holy life, who having [temporarily] discarded sensual desire, $becoming secluded from sensual desire, on the breaking up of the body $after death reappeared in a good realm of existence, being reborn in heaven. 
$Great Seer, the Sakyan woman Gopikā was such a disciple of the World￾honored One. 
She too followed the World-honored One and practiced the $holy life. 
She detested her female body and desired to have a male appear￾ance, to move out of her female body and acquire a male form. 
Having $[temporarily] discarded sensual desire and become secluded from sensual $desire, on the breaking up of the body after death, [she/he] reappeared in $a sublime realm of existence, among the devas of the Thirty-three, as my $son. 
Since he was reborn [there], all the devas knew that the deva Gopaka $is endowed with great bases of supernormal power, great power, great $merit, and great authoritative power. 
$Again, Great Seer, I have seen three monks, disciples of the World￾honored One, who also had followed the World-honored One and practiced $the holy life [but] had not discarded sensual desire nor become secluded $53$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$from sensual desire. 
On the breaking up of the body after death they were $reborn in another lowly gandhabba palace. 
After rebirth, they came to $the devas of the Thirty-three every day to serve all the devas and attend $on Gopaka, a son of devas. 
$On seeing them, the son of devas [Gopaka] spoke these verses:47$I was a laywoman possessing the eye [of Dharma], $My name was Gopikā. 
$I extended respect to the Buddha and the Dharma, $And served the Sangha [of monks] with pure intention. 
$By grace of the Buddha’s favor, $The great merit of the Sakyan son, $I came to sublime birth among the Thirty-three, $Known to them as a fortunate son of devas. 
$Seeing those former monks, $[Now] reborn as gandhabbas, $Standing before me, extending their hands with joined palms, $I, Gopaka, spoke to them in verses: $[You] were formerly disciples of Gotama, $While I was formerly a human being. 
$You came to my house $And I offered you fine food and drink. 
$You were formerly equal to noble ones, $Practicing the unsurpassable holy life. 
$Yet now you are subservient to others, $Coming daily to serve the devas. 
$Formerly I served you. 
$I heard the Noble One teaching the Dharma well. 
$I gained faith, became accomplished in morality, $And came to sublime birth [among] the Thirty-three. 
$You were formerly served, $Practicing the unsurpassable holy life. 
$54$Division 11$Yet now you are subservient to others, $Coming daily to serve the devas. 
$In which direction will you head, $After having received the Buddha’s Dharma? $Have you turned your backs on the Dharma, $Well taught by the one who certainly has awakened vision? $I saw you all in the distant past; $Now you are reborn as lowly gandhabbas. 
$By yourselves you practiced inappropriately, $By yourselves you took rebirth inappropriately.48$I was formerly a householder. 
$Look at me now, endowed with excellent merit! $Transformed from a female into a son of devas, $Freely enjoying the five kinds of sensual pleasure. 
$Being scolded as sons of Gotama,49$They wearily lamented, “Gotama, $We should now advance in practice, $As the son of devas (Gopaka) has rightly said.” $Two of them practiced energetically, $Remembering Gotama’s Dharma and discipline. 
$Knowing the perils of desire, $They promptly discarded desire, became separated from it. 
$Having been bound by the fetter of desire, $They promptly succeeded in discarding it and leaving it far behind. 
$Like an elephant breaking out of its harness, $They went beyond the devas of the Thirty-three $And the devas Indra and Brahmā, $Who had all come together in an assembly. 
$Seated on their [meditation] seats, they promptly left [the devas $ behind], $Having heroically discarded the dust of sensual desire. 
$55^taisho634c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Seeing this, Sakka, the ruler of the devas, became dismayed [and $ exclaimed], $“They have outdone the devas, the devas among devas! $Formerly born into a lowly [sphere], $They have gone beyond the devas of the Thirty-three!” $In subtle quiet words [he had expressed his] dismay. 
$After that Gopaka said: $Among human beings, the Buddha is supreme, $The Sakyan Sage, who knows about sensual desire. 
$Among his sons [these ones] had lost mindfulness, $[But] after my scolding, they recovered it again. 
$One of the three $Has been reborn among the gandhabbas. 
$[The other] two attained the right path, $Being in heaven they delight in the faculty of concentration. 
$The Dharma you have taught is like this, $Disciples become free of perplexity, $Overcome the taints, discard erroneous doubt, $And pay homage to the Buddha, the supreme one with subdued $ faculties. 
$They awakened to the teachings $And were both able to ascend to a better realm. 
$After having ascended, $They were reborn among the Brahmā devas. 
$We know that Dharma, $Great Seer, [therefore] we have come here. 
$At that time the World-honored One thought, “This spirit has for a long $time been free of flattery; he is without deception, without delusions, and is $of upright character. 
If he asks, it is because he wants to know fully; he does $not [just] want to get in touch and be entertained. 
It is the same with the ques￾tions he will ask. 
Let me explain the profound higher Dharma [to him].” $56$Division 11$Having understood this, the World-honored One spoke these verses to Sakka, $the ruler of the devas: $For the sake of present happiness, $And for happiness in future existences, $Kosiya, you may ask without restriction $According to what pleases your mind. 
$Each question asked, $Will be completely resolved for you. 
$The World-honored One allows it $Saying, “The deva’s request is seen as merited.” $In this Magadha country, $Let the worthy Vāsava (Sakka) pose his questions!50$At this Sakka, the ruler of the devas, said: $World-honored One, as to devas, human beings, asuras, gandhabbas, $yakkhas, as well as the various other kinds and groups [of beings], how $many fetters does each of them have? $On hearing this, the World-honored One replied: $Kosiya, as to devas, human beings, asuras, gandhabbas, yakkhas, as well $as the various other kinds and groups [of beings], each of them has two $fetters, namely, stinginess and jealousy. 
Each of them thinks, “May I be $without bonds, without fetters, without resentment, without hatred, without $conflict, without fighting, without dukkha, and let me dwell at ease!” Yet, $despite thinking like this, each of them has bonds, has fetters, has resentment, $has conflict, has fighting, has dukkha, and does not dwell at ease. 
$Then, having heard this, Sakka, the ruler of the devas, said: $Just so, World-honored One; just so, Well-gone One; just so, Great Seer. 
$Each god, human being, asura, gandhabba, yakkha, as well as each of $the various other kinds and groups [of beings] has these two fetters. 
Each $of them thinks, “May I be without bonds, without fetters, without resent￾ment, without hatred, without conflict, without fighting, without dukkha, $57^taisho635a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$and let me dwell at ease!” Yet, despite thinking like this, each of them $has bonds, has fetters, has resentment, has conflict, has fighting, has $dukkha, and does not dwell at ease. 
$Just so, World-honored One; just so, Well-gone One; just so, Great $Seer. 
I have entirely understood the Dharma as the Buddha has taught it. 
$I have discarded doubt and gone beyond perplexity, and I am without $uncertainty because of hearing what the Buddha has said. 
$Then Sakka, the ruler of the devas, having heard what the Buddha said, $was delighted and received it respectfully. 
He asked further: $Great Seer, as to stinginess and jealousy, what is their cause, what is their $condition? From where do they arise, by what do they exist; and by what $cause is there no stinginess and jealousy? $On hearing this, the World-honored One replied: $Kosiya, as to stinginess and jealousy, their cause is liking and disliking, $their condition is liking and disliking. 
From liking and disliking they arise, $by liking and disliking they exist; if there is no liking and disliking, then $there is no stinginess and jealousy. 
$Then, having heard this, Sakka, the ruler of the devas, said: $Just so, World-honored One; just so, Well-gone One; just so, Great Seer. 
$As to stinginess and jealousy, their cause is liking and disliking, their con￾dition is liking and disliking. 
From liking and disliking they arise, by $liking and disliking they exist; if there is no liking and disliking, then $there is no stinginess and jealousy. 
$Just so, World-honored One; just so, Well-gone One; just so, Great $Seer. 
I have entirely understood the Dharma as the Buddha has taught it. 
$I have discarded doubt and overcome perplexity, and I am without uncer￾tainty because of hearing what the Buddha has said. 
$Then Sakka, the ruler of the devas, having heard what the Buddha said, $was delighted and received it respectfully. 
He asked further: $Great Seer, as to liking and disliking, what is their cause, what is their $58^taisho635b Division 11$condition? From where do they arise, by what do they exist, and by what $cause is there no liking and disliking? $On hearing this, the World-honored One answered: $Kosiya, as to liking and disliking, their cause is desire, their condition is $desire. 
From desire they arise, by desire they exist; if there is no desire, $then there is no liking and disliking. 
$Then, having heard this, Sakka, the ruler of the devas, said: $Just so, World-honored One; just so, Well-gone One; just so, Great Seer. 
$As to liking and disliking, their cause is desire, their condition is desire.

$I have discarded doubt and overcome perplexity, and I am without uncer￾tainty because of hearing what the Buddha has said. 
$Then Sakka, the ruler of the devas, having heard what the Buddha said, $was delighted and received it respectfully. 
He asked further: $Great Seer, as to desire, what is its cause, what is its condition? From $where does it arise, by what does it exist; and by what cause is there no $desire? $On hearing this, the World-honored One answered: $Kosiya, as to desire, its cause is [desirous] thinking, its condition is $[desirous] thinking. 
From [desirous] thinking it arises, by [desirous] think￾ing it exists; if there is no [desirous] thinking, then there is no desire. 
$Then, having heard this, Sakka, the ruler of the devas, said: $Just so, World-honored One; just so, Well-gone One; just so, Great Seer. 
$As to desire, its cause is [desirous] thinking, its condition is [desirous] $thinking.

Thus countless evil and unwholesome states arise in the mind. 
In $this way this entire great mass of dukkha arises. 
$If there is no [desirous] intention, then there is no [desirous] thinking; $if there is no [desirous] thinking, then there is no desire; if there is no desire, $then there is no liking and disliking; if there is no liking and disliking, then $there is no stinginess and jealousy; if there is no stinginess and jealousy, $then there is no [using of] sword and club, no dissension and quarreling, $no hatred and jealousy, no flattery and deception, and no false speech and $divisive speech.

$Then, having heard this, Sakka, the ruler of the devas, said: $Just so, World-honored One; just so, Well-gone One; just so, Great Seer. 
$As to [desirous] thinking, its cause is [desirous] intention, its condition $is [desirous] intention. 
From [desirous] intention it arises, because of $60^taisho635c Division 11$[desirous] intention it exists; if there is no [desirous] intention, then there $is no [desirous] thinking.

He asked further: $Great Seer, as to a monk on the path leading to the cessation of illusion, $how many factors is he endowed with, and how many factors does he $practice to preserve the code of rules?54$On hearing this, the World-honored One replied: $Kosiya, as to a monk on the path leading to the cessation of illusion, he $is endowed with six factors, and he practices six factors to preserve the $code of rules. 
What are the six? They are: seeing forms with the eyes, $hearing sounds with the ears, smelling odors with the nose, tasting flavors $with the tongue, sensing tangibles with the body, and cognizing mental $objects with the mind.

$Then Sakka, the ruler of the devas, asked further: $Great Seer, for what reason are renunciants and brahmins not all necessarily $67$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$able to attain the ultimate—the ultimate purity, the ultimate holy life, the $ultimate completion of the holy life? $On hearing this, the World-honored One replied: $Kosiya, if there is a renunciant or brahmin who has not, by the unsurpass￾able elimination of craving, rightly and well liberated his mind, then he $does not attain the ultimate—the ultimate purity, the ultimate holy life, $the ultimate completion of the holy life.

$Then Sakka, the ruler of the devas, having heard what the Buddha said, $having received it well, and having kept it well [in mind], said: $Great Seer, I have had the thorn of doubt for a long time. 
Today the World￾honored One has pulled it out. 
Why is that? It is because he is a tathāgata, $free from attachment and fully awakened. 
$The World-honored One asked, “Kosiya, do you recall ever having, in the $past, asked other renunciants and brahmins about these matters?” $68^taisho637b Division 11$Then Sakka, the ruler of the devas, replied:57$The World-honored One, the Great Seer, would know this himself. 
Great $Seer, [in the past] the devas of the Thirty-three assembled in the Sudhamma $Hall. 
Each of them, harboring worry and grief, exclaimed again and again, $“If we were to encounter a tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awak￾ened, we would certainly go and visit him.” However, Great Seer, we $were unable to encounter a tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awak￾ened. 
Then we engaged to the full in the five kinds of sensual pleasure. 
$Great Seer, we were negligent. 
Having been negligent, one deva with $great merit then died in that sublime realm. 
Great Seer, when I saw that $that deva with great merit had died in that sublime realm, I became $extremely distressed. 
The hairs of my entire body stood on end [and I $thought], “Let me not [so] soon die in this realm!” $Great Seer, because of this I was distressed; because of this I was wor￾ried. 
If I saw another renunciant or brahmin staying in a forest place, in $a mountain grove, or at the base of a tree, or happily dwelling on a high $cliff, or in an isolated quiet place, in seclusion, a place without evil and $without people, conducive to seated meditation, then [I knew that] he was $enjoying seclusion, sitting in meditation peacefully in seclusion, abiding $in happiness. 
Seeing him, I took him to be a tathāgata, free from attachment $and fully awakened, and I went immediately to pay him a respectful visit. 
$Not recognizing me, he asked me, “Who are you?” Then I answered $him, “Great Seer, I am Sakka, the ruler of the devas. 
Great Seer, I am $Sakka, the ruler of the devas.” He asked me further, “I <never> met Sakka $or met members of the Sakka lineage.58 Why are you called Sakka? Why $do you bear the name of the Sakka lineage?” $Then I answered him, “Great Seer, if someone comes and asks me $about some matter, then I answer him according to my ability, according $to my strength (sakkā). 
For this reason, I am called Sakka.”59 $He said, “If we ask Sakka about this matter, Sakka will also answer us $about this matter.” Then he asked me about some matters; I did not ask $him. 
[In the end] he took refuge in me; I did not take refuge in him. 
Great $Seer, from those renunciants and brahmins I could not even get a teaching $about deportment. 
How could I get [a teaching on] questions like these? $69$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Then Sakka, the ruler of the devas, spoke these verses:60$Sakka approached, and Sakka having approached, $Sakka now spoke like this, $“Keeping my mind remote from thought, $And eliminating doubt and all uncertainty, $Long have I traveled the world $In search of a tathāgata. 
$“When I saw renunciants and brahmins $Sitting in meditation in remote seclusion, $I took them to be fully awakened, $And went to serve and respect them. 
$“How can I progress upward?” $Thus I asked them. 
$Having asked, I [still] could not know $The noble path and route. 
$Now the World-honored One has for me $[Removed] the doubts I had in my mind: $What I was thinking, what I was reflecting on, $What my mind was engaged with. 
$Knowing the latent and the manifest in my mind, $The Enlightened One has explained them to me. 
$Honor to the Buddha! Honor to the teacher! $Honor to the sage who is without attachment! $Honor to the one who has cut off all fetters and latent tendencies, $Who has delivered himself and who delivers sentient beings, $Who has awakened to the highest awakening, $The foremost charioteer among charioteers, $The one who is still! Honor to his sublime stillness, $To the Great Seer who, having delivered himself, delivers [others]! $Therefore I pay respect to the one honored by the devas, $And pay homage with my head to the supreme human being, $70^taisho637c Division 11$Who has completely cut out the thorns of craving. 
$I pay homage to the Kinsman of the Sun. 
$At this the World-honored One asked: $Kosiya, do you remember having, in the past, attained detachment like $this and attained joy like this, that is, joy in the Dharma [which you have] $attained in my presence?61$Then Sakka, the ruler of the devas, answered: $World-honored One, the Great Seer would certainly know that himself. 
$Great Seer, once long ago the devas and the asuras were fighting each $other. 
Great Seer, while the devas and the asuras were fighting each other, $I thought, “May the devas triumph and defeat the asuras! May the food $of the devas and the food of the asuras all be eaten by the devas of the $Thirty-three!” Great Seer, when the devas and the asuras fought each other, $the devas finally triumphed, defeating the asuras. 
The food of the devas $and the food of the asuras was all eaten by the devas of the Thirty-three. 
$Great Seer, at that time I experienced detachment and joy; but it was $mixed with the [use of] sword and club, bound up with enmity, with $aggression and conflict, with hatred and envy. 
I was unable to attain pen￾etrative knowledge, to attain the path to awakening, to attain nirvana. 
$Great Seer, today I have attained detachment and joy that is not mixed $with the [use of] sword and club, not bound up with enmity, with aggression $and conflict, or with hatred and envy. 
I am able to attain penetrative knowl￾edge, to attain awakening, and to attain nirvana. 
$The World-honored One asked, “Kosiya, why are you able to attain detach￾ment and joy, that is, to attain joy in the Dharma in my presence?” $Then Sakka, the ruler of the devas, answered: $Great Seer, I am having this thought, “When this life of mine ends, may $I be reborn among human beings. 
May the clan [I am born into] be very $wealthy and opulent, with immeasurable wealth, with livestock and prop￾erty beyond calculation, with a fiefdom well endowed with various feudal $manors. 
That is, may it be a clan of warrior householders, a clan of brahmin $householders, or a clan of merchant householders, or any other clan that 638a$71$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$is very wealthy and opulent, with immeasurable wealth, with livestock $and property beyond calculation, with a fiefdom well endowed with various $feudal manors. 
$Having been born into such a clan, may I be endowed with all the fac￾ulties, and may I gain faith in the Dharma and discipline taught by the Tathā-$gata. 
Having gained faith, may I shave off my hair and beard, don yellow $robes, and out of faith give up the household life and become a homeless $one to train in the path. 
May I train in wisdom. 
Having trained in wisdom, $if I attain wisdom, then may I attain the utmost wisdom, attain the ultimate. 
$As to training in wisdom, if having trained in wisdom I attain wisdom but $do not attain final knowledge, then if there exist devas that are endowed $with great merit, with sublime appearance, radiant and bright, with great $power, peace, and happiness, and living in a [heavenly] palace for a long $time at the highest level, may I be reborn among them!62$Then Sakka, the ruler of the devas, spoke these verses: $Abandoning this divine body, $May I come down and be born among human beings. 
$Free of ignorance, may I enter a womb $According to my intention and pleasure. 
$Having obtained a completely intact body, $May I attain the straight right path $And practice completely the holy life, $Always delighting in begging for almsfood. 
$As to training in wisdom, if, having trained in wisdom, I attain wisdom, $then may I attain the final wisdom, and attain the ultimate. 
[Again] as to $training in wisdom, if, having trained in wisdom, I attain wisdom but do $not attain the final wisdom, then may I be supreme among sublime devas, $famed among all devas as one of the Akaniṭṭha devas, being reborn among $them. 
Great Seer, may I attain nonreturn. 
Great Seer, at present I have $definitely attained stream-entry. 
$The World-honored One asked, “Kosiya, for what reason do you proclaim $that you have attained stream-entry, this extremely fine, very high, and very $extensive distinction?”63$72$Division 11$Then Sakka, the ruler of the devas, answered by reciting verses: $[For me] there is no other [object of] veneration $In this realm, [there is] only the World-honored One. 
$[I] have attained the highest distinction, $Having never before experienced this. 
$Great Seer, as I sit here, $In this divine body, $I have attained an increase in my life span. 
$It is like this; I have seen it with my own eyes. 
$As he was explaining this phenomenon, Sakka, the ruler of the devas, $became remote from the dust of defilements as, [in regard to] all phenomena, $the Dharma eye arose [in him]. 
Eighty-thousand devas also became remote $from the dust of defilements as, [in regard to] all phenomena, the Dharma $eye arose [in them]. 
Thereupon Sakka, the ruler of the devas, saw the Dharma, $attained the Dharma, realized the pure white Dharma, discarded doubt, and $overcame perplexity. 
He would have no other [object of] veneration, would $no longer follow others, being without uncertainty. 
$Having attained the fruit of realization and attained unshakability in regard $to the World-honored One’s Dharma, he rose from his seat, paid homage 638b with his head at the Buddha’s feet, and said: $World-honored One, I now personally take refuge in the Buddha, the $Dharma, and the Sangha of monks. 
May the World-honored One receive $me as a lay disciple, from now on until life ends. 
I personally take refuge $for my entire life. 
$Thereupon Sakka, the ruler of the devas, praised the gandhabba Pañca -$sikha: $Well done! Well done, Pañcasikha! You have benefited me greatly. 
Why $is that? Because of you, the Buddha emerged from meditative concentra￾tion. 
Because you first caused the Buddha to emerge from meditative con￾centration, we were afterward able to meet the Buddha. 
Pañcasikha, when $I return home from here, I will have Bhaddā Suriya-vacchasā, the daughter $of the gandhabba king Timbaru, marry you and become your wife. 
Also, $73$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$I will transfer the territory ruled over by her father, the gandhabba king, $to you as the [new] king of the gandhabbas. 
$Then Sakka, the ruler of the devas, told the devas of the Thirty-three: $All of you, come here! Formerly we paid threefold homage and reverence $to the king of devas Brahmā, who dwells up in the Brahmā world and $who now pays homage and reverence exclusively to the World-honored $One. 
Why is that? As to the World-honored One and Brahmā, Brahmā$acts as creator; [but] the most to be venerated of all sentient beings,64$whether born in the present or in the future, is he who completely knows $what can be known, and completely sees what can be seen.65$Thereupon Sakka, the ruler of the devas, along with the devas of the $Thirty-three and the gandhabba Pañcasikha—all of whom had formerly paid $threefold homage and reverence to Brahmā who dwells up in the Brahmā$world and who [now] pays homage and reverence to the World-honored $One—they [all] paid homage with their heads to the Tathāgata, who is free $from attachment and fully awakened. 
Then Sakka, the ruler of the devas, $along with the devas of the Thirty-three and the gandhabba Pañcasikha, $again paid homage to the World-honored One. 
They paid homage with their $heads at the Buddha’s feet and, having circumambulated him three times, $suddenly vanished from that spot and were no longer to be seen. 
$Then, when the night was over, at dawn, Brahmā, of sublime appearance, $radiant and bright, approached the Buddha. 
Having paid homage with his $head at the Buddha’s feet, he stepped back, stood to one side, and spoke these $verses to the World-honored One: $For the benefit and welfare of the many, $Seeing to their profit and benefit, $The Noble One, while staying in the Magadha country, $Spoke to Vāsava the [ruler] of devas, $Who was asking him questions. 
$When the Great Seer explained this Dharma, Sakka, the ruler of the devas, $became remote from the dust of defilement as, [in regard to] all phenomena, $the Dharma eye arose [in him]. 
Eighty thousand devas also became remote $74$Division 11$from the dust of defilement as, [in regard to] all phenomena, the Dharma eye $arose [in them]. 
$At this the World-honored One said to Brahmā: $It is like this, as Brahmā has said, it is like this, $“For the benefit and welfare of the many, $Seeing to their profit and benefit, $The Noble One, while staying in the Magadha country, $Spoke to Vāsava the [ruler] of devas, $Who was asking him questions.” $Brahmā, when I explained the Dharma [to him], Sakka, the ruler of the devas, became remote from the dust of defilement as, [in regard to] all $phenomena, the Dharma eye arose [in him]. 
Eighty thousand devas also $became remote from the dust of defilement as, [in regard to] all phenomena, $the Dharma eye arose [in them]. 
$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
At that time Sakka, the ruler of the devas, the devas of the Thirty-three, the gandhabba Pañcasikha, and the heavenly Great $Brahmā, having heard what the Buddha said, were delighted and received it $respectfully. 
$135. 
^ck The Discourse on Sujāta66$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha, in the $Grove of Many Toads. 
$At that time there was a householder’s son named Sujāta.67 His father, $when near to death, had passed on to him instructions regarding the six direc￾tions, teaching him well and admonishing him well thus:68$Sujāta, after my death you should pay homage to the six directions, extending $your hands with joined palms, saying this, “Whatever sentient beings are in $the east, I respect, serve, and revere them all. 
Since I have respected, served, $and revered them all, they should also respect, serve, and revere me.” $In the same way [say this]: “Whatever sentient beings are in the south … $in the west ...
in the north ...
at the nadir ...
at the zenith, I respect, serve, $and revere them all. 
Since I have respected, served, and revered them all, $they should also respect, serve, and revere me.” $75^taisho638c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Having heard his father’s instruction, the householder’s son Sujāta told $his father, “Very well. 
I will do as you command.” $Then, after his father’s death, the householder’s son Sujāta, having bathed $at dawn, put on new linen clothes, took fresh kusa grass in his hand, and $went to the water’s edge. 
He paid homage to the six directions, extending $his hands with joined palms [saying], “Whatever sentient beings are in the $east, I respect, serve, and revere them all. 
Since I have respected, served, $and revered them all, they should also respect, serve, and revere me.” In the $same way, “Whatever sentient beings are in the south ...
in the west ...
in $the north ...
at the nadir ...
at the zenith, I respect, serve, and revere them $all. 
Since I have respected, served, and revered them all, they should also $respect, serve, and revere me.” $At that time, the night being over, at dawn, the World-honored One put $on his robes and took his bowl and went into Rājagaha to beg for almsfood. 
$As the World-honored One was going into Rājagaha to beg for almsfood, he $saw in the distance that the householder’s son Sujāta, having bathed at dawn, $put on new linen clothes, and taken fresh kusa grass in his hand, had gone $to the water’s edge. 
He was paying homage to the six directions, extending $his hands with joined palms, saying, “Whatever sentient beings are in the $east, I respect, serve, and revere them all. 
Since I have respected, served, $and revered them all, they should also respect, serve, and revere me.” In the $same way, “Whatever sentient beings are in the south ...
in the west ...
in $the north ...
at the nadir ...
at the zenith, I respect, serve, and revere them $all. 
Since I have respected, served, and revered them all, they should also $respect, serve, and revere me.” $Having seen this, the World-honored One went to the householder’s son $Sujāta and asked him: $Householder’s son, from which renunciant or brahmin have you received $instruction on respecting, serving, and revering, that you have bathed at $dawn, put on new linen clothes, taken fresh kusa grass in your hand, gone $to the water’s edge, and paid homage to the six directions, extending your $hands with joined palms [saying], “Whatever sentient beings are in the east, $I respect, serve, and revere them all. 
Since I have respected, served, and $revered them all, they should also respect, serve, and revere me.” In the $76^taisho639a Division 11$same way, “Whatever sentient beings are in the south ...
in the west ...
in $the north ...
at the nadir ...
at the zenith, I respect, serve, and revere them $all. 
Since I have respected, served, and revered them all, they should also $respect, serve, and revere me”? $The householder’s son Sujāta answered: $World-honored One, I did not receive instruction from another renunciant $or brahmin. 
World-honored One, when my father was near to death, he $passed on to me instructions regarding the six directions, teaching me $well and admonishing me well thus, “Sujāta, after my death you should $pay homage to the six directions, extending your hands with joined palms $[saying], ‘Whatever sentient beings are in the east, I respect, serve, and $revere them all. 
Since I have respected, served, and revered them all, they $should also respect, serve, and revere me.’ In the same way, ‘Whatever $sentient beings are in the south ...
in the west ...
in the north ...
at the $nadir ...
at the zenith, I respect, serve, and revere them all. 
Since I have $respected, served, and revered them all, they should also respect, serve, $and revere me.’” $World-honored One, I received as my father’s legacy his instructions $about how to respect, serve, and revere. 
Therefore, I bathe at dawn, put on $new linen clothes, take fresh kusa grass in my hand, and go to the water’s $edge. 
I pay homage to the six directions, extending my hands with joined $palms [saying], “Whatever sentient beings are in the east, I respect, serve, $and revere them all. 
Since I have respected, served, and revered them, they $should also respect, serve, and revere me.” In the same way, “Whatever $sentient beings are in the south ...
in the west ...
in the north ...
at the $nadir ...
at the zenith, I respect, serve, and revere them all. 
Since I have $respected, served, and revered them all, they should also respect, serve, $and revere me.” $Having heard this, the World-honored One said: $Householder’s son, I affirm the existence of the six directions; I do not $deny it.69 Householder’s son, if a person is able to differentiate skillfully 639b the six directions and to separate themselves from the defilement of evil $and unwholesome actions in the four directions, then they will be worthy $77$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$of respect and reverence in the present; and on the breaking up of their $body after death they will certainly go to a good realm of existence, being $reborn in heaven. 
$Householder’s son, for sentient beings there are four types of action, $four types of defilement. 
What are the four? Householder’s son, killing $living beings is a type of action of sentient beings, a type of defilement. 
$Taking what is not given ...
sexual misconduct ...
false speech is a type $of action of sentient beings, a type of defilement. 
$Then the World-honored One spoke these verses: $Killing living beings, taking what is not given, $Sexual misconduct with another’s wife, $And saying what is not true, $These the wise do not praise. 
$Householder’s son, owing to four causes, a person will acquire much guilt. 
$What are the four? They are: acting from desire, acting from hatred, acting $from fear, and acting from ignorance. 
$Then the World-honored One spoke these verses: $Acting from desire, hatred, fear, and ignorance, $Evilly, contrary to the Dharma, $One will certainly destroy one’s reputation, $Like the vanishing of the waning moon. 
$Householder’s son, owing to four causes, a person will acquire much $merit. 
What are the four? They are: not acting from desire, not acting from $hatred, not acting from fear, and not acting from ignorance. 
$Then the World-honored One spoke these verses: $Discarding desire, being without hatred and fear, $Acting without ignorance, acting in accordance with the Dharma, $One’s reputation comes to be known everywhere, $Like the gradual filling out of the waxing moon. 
$Householder’s son, you should know that for one pursuing wealth there $are six wrong paths.

The second wrong path $for one pursuing wealth is roaming [the streets] at unseemly times.

They will be unable to gain new wealth not yet gained, $and their existing wealth will be used up.

What are the $six? First, they leave themselves unprotected; second, they leave their $wealth unprotected; third, he leaves his wife unprotected;71 fourth, they $are suspected by others; fifth, they are subject to many miseries; sixth, $they are condemned by others. 
Householder’s son, a person who roams $[the streets] at unseemly times will neglect their business, and if they neg￾lect their business, it will not be successful. 
They will be unable to gain $new wealth not yet gained, and the existing wealth will be used up. 
$Householder’s son, if a person drinks intoxicating liquor [which leads $to] negligence, one should know that there are six dangers inherent in $that. 
[What are the six?] First, loss of one’s present wealth; second, [sus￾ceptibility] to much illness; third, increased quarreling; fourth, indecent $exposure; fifth, gaining a bad reputation; sixth, loss of wisdom and the $arising of ignorance. 
Householder’s son, a person who drinks intoxicating $liquor and becomes negligent will neglect their business, and if they $neglect their business, it will not be successful. 
They will be unable to $gain new wealth not yet gained, and the existing wealth will be used up. 
$79$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Householder’s son, if a person associates with bad friends, one should $know that there are six dangers inherent in that. 
What are the six? First, $companionship with thieves; second, companionship with swindlers; third, $companionship with drunkards; fourth, companionship with people of $loose character; fifth, pursuit of fun and games; sixth, regarding these $[above-mentioned people] as one’s intimates. 
Regarding these as one’s $intimates, householder’s son, a person who associates with bad friends $will neglect their business, and if they neglect their business, it will not $succeed. 
They will be unable to gain new wealth not yet gained, and their $existing wealth will be used up.

What are the six? First, $fondness for listening to singing; second, fondness for watching dancers; $third, fondness for going after amusement; fourth, fondness for watching $the playing of bells; fifth, fondness for hand-clapping; sixth, fondness for $big crowds and gatherings.

$Householder’s son, a person who is lazy should know that there are $six dangers inherent in that.

First, [saying] “It’s too $early,” they do not work; second, [saying] “It’s too late,” they do not work; $third, [saying] “It’s too cold,” they do not work; fourth, [saying] “It’s too $hot,” they do not work; fifth, [saying] “I’m too full,” they do not work; $sixth, [saying] “I’m too hungry,” they do not work. 
Householder’s son, a $person who is lazy will neglect their business, and if they neglect their $business, it will not be successful. 
They will be unable to gain new wealth $not yet gained, and their existing wealth will be used up. 
$Then the World-honored One spoke these verses:72$The various kinds of gambling, [roaming] in search of sex, $Addiction to intoxicating liquor, delighting in entertainment, $Keeping company with bad friends, $Laziness and not doing one’s work, $80^taisho640a Division 11$Dissipation and lack of self-guarding— $These situations destroy a person. 
$Going and coming without self-guarding, $Sexual misconduct with another’s wife, $A mind constantly fettered by resentment, $Wishful seeking for what is unbeneficial, $Drinking intoxicating liquor, thinking of women and sex— $These things destroy a person. 
$Recurrent unwholesome behavior, $Violence, rejection of others’ guidance, $Insulting renunciants and brahmins, $Confusion, holding wrong views, $Brutality and doing black deeds— $These things destroy a person. 
$Self-inflicted deprivation and poverty, $Drinking intoxicating liquor, indecent exposure, $With debt [unending] like a spring of water, $Will certainly ruin the family. 
$Frequenting liquor shops, $Associating with bad friends, $They fail to earn the wealth they should, $Regarding [bad] companionship as enjoyable. 
$Having many bad friends, $Constantly keeping bad company, $In this world and the future world, $In both they will come to ruin. 
$A person who practices evil comes to decline; $One who practices good comes to prosperity. 
$One who practices for achievement comes to increase; $Therefore, one should practice for achievement. 
$One who practices ascending gets to ascend, $81$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Constantly gaining wisdom and ascending. 
$In turn they achieve pure morality $And ascend in what is subtle and sublime. 
$By one who likes to sleep in the daytime, $And likes roaming about at night, $Who is negligent and constantly drinking liquor, $Family life cannot be maintained. 
$“It is too cold!” or “It is too hot!”, $So says the lazy person. 
$In the end they do not succeed in their business; $Ultimately they get no financial profit. 
$If [however], cold and heat $Are not reckoned with, being like [mere] straws, $A person doing their work in this way $Will never lack happiness. 
$Householder’s son, there are four enemies who have the appearance of $friends. 
What are the four? The first enemy who has the appearance of a $friend is one who knows about your affairs; the second enemy who has $the appearance of a friend is a flatterer; the third enemy who has the $appearance of a friend is one who is all talk [and no action]; the fourth $enemy who has the appearance of a friend is a bad companion. 
$Householder’s son, for four reasons one who knows about your affairs $is an enemy who has the appearance of a friend. 
What are the four? First, $knowing about your affairs, they carry off your property; second, while $giving little, they take a lot; third, they may exploit your fears; fourth, $they become intimate for [their own] benefit.

$82^taisho640b Division 11$You should always keep far away from them, $As [you would from] a terrifying path.

What are the four? First, they hold you back from $doing good; second, they incite you to do evil; third, they praise you to $your face; fourth, behind your back they speak ill of you. 
$Then the World-honored One spoke these verses: $If [someone] holds you back from fine wholesome things, $[Or] incites you to do what is evil and unwholesome, $[Or] praises you to your face $[But] behind your back speaks ill of you; $If you know [the distinction between] good and evil $And also recognize these two kinds of talk, $[Then you know that] this [seeming] friend should not be befriended. 
$Knowing that person to be like this, $You should always keep far away from them, $As [you would from] a terrifying path. 
$Householder’s son, for four reasons the one who is all talk [and no action] $is an enemy who has the appearance of a friend. 
What are the four? First, $that person reminds you of their support in the past; second, they keep $promising future support; third, they speak what is void or untrue; fourth, $their present support will certainly disappear, as they say, “I will do it” $but do not do it. 
$Then the World-honored One spoke these verses: $[If someone] reminds you of their past [support] and [promises] future $ [support]; $[If someone] talks empty words and his present support disappears, $[If someone says,] “I will do it” [but then] does not do as they have said, $Then know them as an enemy who resembles a friend. 
$You should always keep far away from them, $As [you would from] a terrifying path. 
$83$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Householder’s son, for four reasons a bad companion is an enemy who $has the appearance of a friend. 
What are the four? First, they incite you $to engage in various kinds of gambling; second, they incite you to roam $[the streets] at unseemly times; third, they incite you to drink liquor; $fourth, they incite you to associate with bad friends. 
$Then the World-honored One spoke these verses: $Incited to various kinds of gambling, $Incited to drink liquor, or to commit adultery, $Practicing what is low, not practicing what is supreme, $You will decline, like the waning moon. 
$You should always keep far away from them, $As you would from a terrifying path.73$Householder’s son, as to good friends, you should know that they are of $four kinds. 
What are the four? First, one who is the same in bad and good $[times] should be recognized as a good friend; second, one who is com￾passionate [toward you] should be recognized as a good friend; third, one $who seeks what is advantageous [to you] should be recognized as a good $friend; fourth, one who greatly benefits [you] should be recognized as a $good friend.74$Householder’s son, for four reasons one who is the same in bad and $good [times] should be recognized as a good friend. 
What are the four? $First, they will give themselves up for you; second, they will give up their $wealth for you; third, they will give up their spouse for you; fourth, they $are patient with what you say [to them]. 
$Then the World-honored One spoke these verses: $One who will give up their desired property or spouse, $Who is able to be patient with what you say [to them], $Knowing them to be a friend who is the same in bad and good [times], $A wise person should associate [with them]. 
$Householder’s son, for four reasons one who is compassionate [toward you] $should be recognized as a good friend. 
What are the four? First, they incite $84^taisho640c Division 11$in you sublime states; second, they restrain you from evil states; third, they $praise you to your face; fourth, they protect you from your enemies. 
$Then the World-honored One spoke these verses: $One who incites in you what is good and wholesome, who restrains $ you from evil, $Who praises you to your face, and who protects you from your enemies— $You should know them as a good friend who is compassionate [toward $ you]. 
$A wise person should associate with [such a person].

What are the four? First, $they reveal their secrets [to you]; second, they do not conceal any secrets $[from you]; third, they delight in what is to [your] advantage; fourth, they $are not distressed about what is not to their advantage. 
$Then the World-honored One spoke these verses: $One who tells you their secrets and does not conceal them, $Who delights in what is to your advantage and is not distressed by $ what is not, $Know them as a good friend who seeks [your] advantage. 
$A wise person should associate [with them]. 
$Householder’s son, for four reasons one who greatly benefits you should $be recognized as a good friend. 
What are the four? First, they know when $your property is exhausted; second, knowing that your property is exhausted, $they give you property; third, they teach and admonish you when they see $you being negligent; fourth, they are always compassionate [toward you]. 
$Then the World-honored One spoke these verses: $One who knows when your property is exhausted, who [then] gives $ you property, $Who admonishes you when you are negligent, and who is compassionate $ [toward you]— $85$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$You should know them as a good friend who benefits you greatly.

First, teaching them so that they [gain] faith, $88^taisho641c Division 11$practice with faith, and recollect faith; second, teaching them to observe $the moral precepts; third, teaching them so that they [gain] wide learning; $fourth, teaching them to practice charitable giving; fifth, teaching them $so that they [gain] wisdom, dwell with wisdom, and are established in $wisdom. 
Renunciants and brahmins are well disposed toward donors in $these five ways. 
$Householder’s son, thus the zenith is discerned in two ways. 
Householder’s $son, in the noble Dharma and discipline the zenith refers to donors and renun￾ciants and brahmins. 
Householder’s son, if a person respects and serves $renunciants and brahmins, then they will certainly prosper and not decline. 
$Householder’s son, there are four ways of caring. 
What are the four? $First, generosity; second, loving words; third, acting beneficently; fourth, $benefiting equally.76$Then the World-honored One spoke these verses: $[By] generosity, loving words, $Constantly acting for others’ benefit, $And benefiting sentient beings equally, $[One’s] reputation spreads far and wide. 
$These [four ways of] taking care of the world $Are like the driver steering the chariot. 
$Without these [ways of] caring, $A mother does not, from her child, $Receive support and respect, $Nor does a father [receive their support and respect]. 
$If [however], these ways of caring are present, $Then great merit is thereby gained. 
$Shining far like the light of the sun, $Quickly bringing benefit, $Gentle in speech, intelligent— $Such a person gains a good reputation. 
$Decisive, protective, and free of pride,77$Quickly bringing benefit, $89$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Accomplished in faith and moral precepts— $Such a person gains a good reputation. 
$Always rising [to the occasion], not lazy, $Delighting in offering food and drink to others, $Well disciplined in their movements when about to depart— $Such a person gains a good reputation. 
$Friends and colleagues being mutually empathic, $Caring for each other equally. 
$The caring that exists between friends $Is very refined, like that between teacher and disciple. 
$One should first learn technical skills, $And after that seek wealth. 
$Having afterward obtained wealth, $[One should] divide it into <six> parts:78$One part for food and drink, one part for farming, $One part set aside and saved $In case of need in emergencies. 
$To cultivators or merchants $One part [should be] lent out for interest. 
$The fifth is for marriage [expenses], $The sixth for constructing a house. 
$If a household is equipped with these six parts, $Will it not increase and quickly attain happiness? $[Such a householder] will certainly amass wealth, $Like water flowing into the sea. 
$Pursuing property in this way, $He is like a bee gathering [nectar] from flowers. 
$Having pursued wealth for a long time, $He will derive pleasure from it. 
$Do not spend [your] money too far, $Nor too widely. 
$90^taisho642a Division 11$Do not give money $To one who is violent and aggressive. 
$The east is parents; $The south is teachers; $The west is the wife; $The north is servants; $The nadir [is] friends and colleagues; $The zenith [is] renunciants and brahmins. 
$Wishing to revere all these directions $In two ways, one gains a great reputation. 
$Having revered all these directions, $A donor will be reborn in heaven. 
$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the house￾holder’s son Sujāta was delighted and received it respectfully.79 $136. 
^ck The Discourse on Merchants $Who Searched for Property80$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $Long ago, in [the continent of] Jambudīpa a group of merchants assembled $in a merchants’ assembly hall. 
They thought, “Let us board an oceangoing $ship and sail across the ocean in order to bring back treasure to meet our $housekeeping expenses.” They thought again, “Friends, since we cannot $foresee whether or not it will be safe to sail across the sea, let us each pre￾pare flotation devices, such as sheepskin bags, big gourds, and rafts.” $Then, after they had each prepared flotation devices, such as sheepskin $bags, big gourds, and rafts, they set out to sea. 
As they were sailing across $the sea, their ship was destroyed by the king of the makara sea monsters. 
$The merchants drifted in various different directions on their flotation $devices, such as sheepskin bags, big gourds, and rafts. 
$At that time there suddenly arose a strong wind from the east which $blew the merchants to the western shore of the sea. 
There they met many $91^taisho642b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$women of very dignified beauty, all of whom had their bodies adorned $with various kinds of jewelry. 
On seeing the merchants, those women $said: “Welcome, friends! Come quickly, friends! This is an extremely $pleasant and most wonderful place with parks, viewing terraces, bathing $pools, seats and couches, and luxuriant groves. 
There is much wealth: $gold, silver, crystal, beryl, maṇi-jewel, pearl, green jade, white jade, car￾nelian, coral, amber, agate, tortoiseshell, ruby, and jade-pearl. 
All of this, $friends, we will give to you. 
You should enjoy yourselves together with $us. 
[But,] merchants of Jambudīpa, do not go toward the south, even in $your dreams!” $The merchants all enjoyed themselves together with the women. 
The $merchants cohabited with the women who consequently gave birth to $male or female [offspring]. 
Later, one wise merchant of Jambudīpa, while $alone in a quiet place, thought, “Why do the women prohibit us from $going toward the south? Let me keep watch on the woman with whom I $am living. 
When I know that she has fallen asleep, I will slowly and quietly $get up and secretly go toward the south.” $That one wise merchant of Jambudīpa therefore kept watch on the $woman with whom he was living; knowing that she had fallen asleep, he $slowly and quietly got up and secretly went toward the south.81 As he $went south, that one wise merchant of Jambudīpa heard in the distance a $great uproar, with high-pitched voices calling out. 
The noise came from $many people weeping regretfully, calling out for their parents, crying out $for their wives and their beloved and intimate friends, and lamenting that $they were unable to see again the excellent Jambudīpa, which had been $so peaceful and happy. 
$On hearing that, the merchant was in great fear and all his body hairs $stood on end. 
[He thought,] “Let not anyone, human or non-human, entrap $me!” Then the one wise merchant of Jambudīpa overcame his fear and $continued heading southward. 
Having gone further southward, the one $wise merchant of Jambudīpa suddenly saw in the east a great iron wall. 
$On seeing that, he looked all over it but could see no door, nor even a $place where a cat could get out. 
$To the north of the iron wall the one wise merchant of Jambudīpa saw $a big thicket of trees. 
Going to that big thicket, he slowly and quietly $92^taisho642c Division 11$climbed [one of the trees]. 
Having climbed it, he asked that great group $of people, “Friends, why are you weeping regretfully, calling out for your $parents, crying out for your wives82 and your beloved and intimate friends, $and lamenting that you are unable to see again the excellent Jambudīpa, $which was so peaceful and happy?” $Then that great group of people answered, “Friend, we are merchants $of Jambudīpa. 
[Once] we assembled in the merchants’ assembly hall, and $we thought, ‘Let us board an oceangoing ship and sail across the ocean $in order to bring back treasure to meet our housekeeping expenses.’ We $thought again, ‘Friends, since we cannot foresee whether or not it will be $safe to sail across the sea, let us each prepare flotation devices, such as $sheepskin bags, big gourds, and rafts.’ $“Friend, after we had each prepared flotation devices, such as sheepskin $bags, big gourds, and rafts, we set out to sea. 
Friend, as we were sailing $across the sea, our ship was destroyed by the king of the makara sea mon￾sters. 
Friend, we all drifted in various different directions on our flotation $devices, such as sheepskin bags, big gourds, and rafts. 
$“At that time there suddenly arose a strong wind from the east, which $blew us merchants to the western shore of the sea. 
There we met many $women of very dignified beauty, all of whom had their bodies adorned $with various kinds of jewelry. 
On seeing us, those women said, ‘Welcome, $friends! Come quickly, friends! This is an extremely pleasant and wonderful $place with parks, viewing terraces, bathing pools, seats and couches, and $luxuriant groves. 
There is much wealth: gold, silver, crystal, beryl, maṇi￾jewel, pearl, green jade, white jade, conch-shell, coral, amber, agate, tor￾toiseshell, ruby, and jade-pearl. 
All of this, friends, we will give to you. 
$You should enjoy yourselves together with us. 
[But,] merchants of Jam￾budīpa, do not go toward the south, even in your dreams!’ $“Friend, we all enjoyed ourselves together with the women. 
We cohabited $with the women who consequently gave birth to male or female [offspring]. 
$Friend, as long as those women did not hear of other merchants of Jam￾budīpa sailing on the sea and of their ship being destroyed by the king of $the makara sea monsters, they enjoyed themselves together with us. 
643a$“[But,] friend, when the women heard of other merchants of Jambudīpa $sailing on the sea and of their ship being destroyed by the king of the $93$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$makara sea monsters, they [began] feeding on us. 
We have suffered greatly. 
$When those women are eating a person, if there are any remaining hairs, $nails, or teeth, they take them and eat them up completely. 
When those $women are eating a person, if any blood has dripped on to the ground, $they dig down four inches with their nails to get it and eat it. 
$“Friend, you should know that we merchants of Jambudīpa were orig￾inally five hundred people. 
Of those, two hundred and fifty people have $already been eaten. 
The remaining two hundred and fifty are all now within $this great iron wall. 
Friend, do not trust what those women say! They are $not real people. 
They are yakkha demons.” $At this the one wise merchant of Jambudīpa descended slowly and quietly $from the big thicket of trees and went back the way he had come. 
He returned $to the place where he was living together with the woman. 
$Finding that the woman was still asleep and had not yet woken up, the $one wise merchant of Jambudīpa went immediately, that very night, to $the other merchants of Jambudīpa. 
He said [to them], “You should all $come together to a quiet place. 
Each one come alone; do not bring your $children. 
[We] should secretly discuss something there together.” The $merchants of Jambudīpa went together to that quiet place, each of them $going alone, not bringing his children. 
$Then the one wise merchant of Jambudīpa said, “Merchants, while I $was alone in this quiet place, I had this thought, ‘Why do the women pro￾hibit us from going toward the south? Let me keep watch on the woman $with whom I am living.

$Keep watch on her, and when she has fallen asleep, get up slowly and $quietly, and secretly go to the south. 
Go back to those people and ask $them, ‘Friends, is there any means whereby we people and you people $can safely cross over from here to Jambudīpa?’” Then the one wise mer￾chant of Jambudīpa accepted the [request of the other] merchants by $remaining silent. 
$Then the one wise merchant of Jambudīpa returned to the place of the $woman with whom he was living. 
Keeping watch on her until she had $fallen asleep, he got up slowly and quietly and secretly went toward the $south. 
He went again to where the great group of people was and asked $them, “Friends, is there any means whereby we people and you people $can safely cross over from here to Jambudīpa?” $The people in that great group answered, “Friend, there is no further $means whereby we people can safely cross over from here to Jambudīpa. 
$96^taisho643c Division 11$Friend, we [once] thought, ‘We should together break this wall down and $return home.’ But just as we had this thought, the wall became twice its $normal height. 
Friend, this so-called means has actually prevented us from $safely crossing over from here to Jambudīpa. 
$“Friend, [you asked whether] there are any other means whereby you $people can safely cross over from here to Jambudīpa. 
For us people there $will never be any means. 
$“[However,] friend, we have heard devas up in space proclaiming, $‘You merchants of Jambudīpa are ignorant, indecisive, and also of poor $understanding.

^ck The Discourse on the World85$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $The Tathāgata has himself awakened to the world and expounds it to $others. 
The Tathāgata has understood the world. 
$The Tathāgata has himself awakened to the arising of the world and $expounds it to others. 
The Tathāgata has abandoned the arising of the $world. 
$102^taisho645b Division 11$The Tathāgata has himself awakened to the cessation of the world and $expounds it to others. 
The Tathāgata has realized the cessation of the world. 
$The Tathāgata has himself awakened to the path [leading to the ces￾sation] of the world and expounds it to others. 
The Tathāgata has developed $the path [leading to the cessation] of the world. 
$If there is [anyone who] is completely and fully correct about all things, $then it is he, the Tathāgata, who has understood, seen, awakened to, and $attained everything. 
Why is that? $From the night in the past, when the Tathāgata awakened to the unsur￾passable right and complete awakening, up until the night in the present $when he will attain complete extinction in the remainderless nirvana element, $throughout this period whatever is spoken by the Tathāgata, either on his $own account or in response to others, all of that is true, not false, not departing $from reality, not confused. 
It is the truth and is indeed correct.86$If [people] speak of “the Lion,” you should know that they are speaking $of the Tathāgata.87 Why is that? What the Tathāgata declares in assemblies $is known as “the lion’s roar.” $In the entire world, with its devas, māras, Brahmās, renunciants, and $brahmins, from human beings to devas, the Tathāgata has the status of $Brahmā. 
The Tathāgata has attained coolness, being without vexation and $without heat. 
He is possessed of truth and devoid of falsity.88$Then the World-honored One uttered these verses: $Knowing the entire world, $Surpassing the entire world, $He expounds the entire world, $The entire world as it really is. 
$The supremely and highly regarded hero, $Able to untie all bonds, $He has put an end to all karma, $And is totally liberated from birth and death. 
$Whether deva or human being, $Those who take lifelong refuge in the Buddha $103^taisho645c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Bow their heads in homage to the Tathāgata, $Who is very profound, like the great ocean. 
$Knowing this, one also practices reverence. 
$The devas and gandhabbas $Also bow their heads in homage, $And follow him until death. 
$Bowing their heads in homage to the Wise One, $They take lifelong refuge in the supreme human being, $Who is without grief, free of defilements, at peace, $Unobstructed, totally liberated.89$For the purpose of delighting in meditation, $Dwell secluded, becoming fully concentrated. 
$You should be your own lamp, $[Thinking,] “I must not waste time!” $Those who waste time experience grief and worry, $That is, they fall into hell. 
$Thus said the Buddha.

^ck The Discourse on $Meritorious Deeds90$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the World-honored One told the monks: $Do not fear meritorious action, for it is delightful when recalled to mind. 
$Why is that? Meritorious action is what is called happiness. 
Fear of meri￾torious action is not delightful when recalled to mind. 
Why is that? Lack $of meritorious action is what is called dukkha.91 What is the reason for that? $I recall how, in the distant past, I engaged in meritorious action for a $long time, and I experienced the results for a long time; and that is delight￾ful when recalled to mind. 
Having, in the distant past, practiced loving￾kindness for seven years, I did not come to [be born in] this world [of $104$Division 11$human sensuality] for seven eons of cosmic evolution and destruction. 
$When the world went to destruction, I was reborn in the Heaven of Radi￾ance (ābhassara). 
When the world evolved [again], I descended to take $birth in a vacant Brahmā palace. 
Among those Brahmās I was the Great $Brahmā. 
In other places I was king of the devas, experiencing freedom $and ease for a thousand eons. 
For thirty-six eons I was Sakka, ruler of the $devas; and again for countless eons I was the warrior king Mandhātu.92$Monks, when I was the warrior king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thou￾sand elephants equipped with fine harnesses, adorned with numerous pre￾cious decorations, draped with strings of white pearls, with the royal ele￾phant Uposatha as the chief. 
$Monks, when I was the warrior king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thou￾sand horses equipped with fine harnesses, adorned with numerous precious $decorations, entwined with gold and silver, with the king of horses [Vala￾hassa] as the chief. 
$Monks, when I was the warrior king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thou￾sand chariots, adorned with four kinds of decoration and various beautiful $things, such as the hides of lions, tigers, and leopards woven with designs $of varied colors and various decorations—very swift chariots, the chief $of which was the chariot Vejayanta. 
$Monks, when I was the warrior king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thou￾sand cities, very large and pleasant, with many inhabitants, the chief of $which was the royal city of Kusāvatī. 
$Monks, when I was the warrior king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thou￾sand multistoried buildings, made of four kinds of precious material, gold, $silver, beryl, and crystal, the chief of which was the Sudhamma Hall. 
$Monks, when I was the warrior king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thou￾sand thrones, made of four kinds of precious material, gold, silver, beryl, $and crystal, upholstered with woolen textiles, draped with brocades and $fine silk fabrics, with lined and quilted coverlets, and with cushions [made $of] antelope hide at both ends. 
$Monks, when I was the warrior king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thou￾sand suits of clothing, clothing of linen, clothing of brocade and silk, $clothing of cotton, and clothing of antelope hide. 
$105^taisho646a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Monks, when I was the warrior king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thou￾sand women, each with a splendid, clear, bright, fresh body, of extraor￾dinary beauty exceeding human [beauty], almost divine [beauty], dignified $beauty that delighted those who saw it, richly adorned with various kinds $of precious jewelry, jade and pearl necklaces in abundance, pure warrior $[caste] women, as well as countless women of other castes. 
$Monks, when I was the warrior king Mandhātu, I had eighty-four thousand $kinds of food, served constantly day and night, for me to eat when I wished. 
$Monks, of those eighty-four thousand kinds of food there was one $that was particularly delicious and fresh, with numerous flavors, which $I often ate. 
$Monks, of those eighty-four thousand women there was one woman of $the warrior caste, the most dignified and beautiful, who often waited on me. 
$Monks, of those eighty-four thousand suits of clothes there was one $suit of clothes, of linen or brocade or silk or cotton or antelope hide, that $I often wore. 
$Monks, of those eighty-four thousand thrones there was one throne, of $gold or silver or beryl or crystal, upholstered with woolen textiles, draped $with brocade or fine silk fabric, with lined and quilted coverlets, and with $cushions [made of] antelope hide at both ends, on which I often reclined. 
$Monks, of those eighty-four thousand multistoried buildings, there $was one [made of] gold or silver or beryl or crystal, called Sudhamma $Hall, in which I often stayed. 
$Monk, of those eighty-four thousand cities there was one, very wealthy $and pleasant, with many inhabitants, named Kusāvatī, in which I often $resided. 
$Monks, of those eighty-four thousand chariots there was one, decorated $with various beautiful things, such as the hides of lions, tigers, and leopards, $woven with designs of varied colors, a very swift chariot, named Vejayanta, $in which I often rode when visiting pleasure parks and viewing terraces. 
$Monks, of those eighty-four thousand horses there was one, with bluish $body and crow-like head, the royal horse named Valahassa, which I often $rode when visiting pleasure parks and viewing terraces. 
$Monks, of those eighty-four thousand elephants there was one whose $entire body was very white and whose seven parts were perfect, the royal $106^taisho646b Division 11$elephant named Uposatha, which I often rode when visiting pleasure parks $and viewing terraces. 
$Monks, I had this thought, “What are the kinds of action whose fruit $and result have caused me to be endowed today with this great supernormal $power, great and mighty virtue, great merit, great and mighty power?” $Monks, again I had this thought, “There are three kinds of action whose $fruits and results have caused me to be endowed today with this great $supernormal power, great and mighty virtue, great merit, great and mighty $power. 
The first is charitable giving, the second is self-discipline, and the $third is restraint.” $Then the World-honored One uttered these verses:93$Look at these results of meritorious action, $So wonderful and so abundant! $Monks, [because] in the distant past, $I had practiced loving-kindness for seven years, $For seven eons of evolution and destruction, $I did not come to [birth in] this world [of human sensuality]. 
$When the world went to destruction, $I was born in the Heaven of Radiance. 
$When the world evolved [again], $I took birth in Brahmā Heaven. 
$Among the Brahmās I was the Great Brahmā, $And for a thousand births I experienced freedom and ease as a deva. 
$For thirty-six [births] I was Sakka; $And for countless hundreds [of births] I was the king Mandhātu. 
$The warrior king Mandhātu $Is the most honored by human beings. 
$In accordance with Dharma, without relying on sword or club, $He reigned over the entire world. 
$In accordance with Dharma, without abusive oppression, $He taught genuine peace and happiness. 
$In accordance with Dharma, [his teaching] was passed on $And spread over the whole great earth. 
$107$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Of great wealth and much property— $Such was the clan into which he was born, $Endowed with abundant property and grain crops, $He acquired the seven treasures. 
$Because of this great merit, $Wherever he was born, he experienced freedom and ease. 
$Buddhas guide the world $By what a buddha teaches. 
$Knowing this very special [fact], $One sees their abundant supernormal power. 
$Whoever knows it, yet is without faith, $Such a one is born into darkness. 
$Therefore, one should take action oneself, $Seeking great merit and fortune. 
$One should be respectful toward the Dharma, $Always recollecting the Buddha and his Dharma and discipline.

^ck The Discourse on the Path $of Stillness $Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $A young monk who has just been ordained should often approach the path $of stillness, to contemplate the signs [of a corpse, namely], the sign of $bones, the sign of blue color, the sign of decay, the sign of being devoured $[by scavenging animals], and the sign of a skeleton. 
Having received and $retained these signs well, he returns to his dwelling place, washes his $hands and feet, spreads his sitting mat, sits down cross-legged on the seat, $and recollects these signs, [namely,] the sign of bones, the sign of blue $color, the sign of decay, the sign of being devoured, and the sign of a $108^taisho646c Division 11$skeleton. 
Why is that? If that monk cultivates these signs, he will quickly $remove the defects of craving and hatred from his mind. 
$Then the World-honored One uttered these verses: $If a young monk, $In his practice has not yet achieved stilling of the mind, $Then he should approach the path of stillness, $Wishing to remove his sensual passion, $With a mind free of hatred and quarrel, $With loving-kindness and compassion for all sentient beings, $He pervades all directions. 
$As he goes [there] to contemplate the [dead] bodies, $He should contemplate the sign of blue color, $As well as that of decay, $Contemplate [the signs of] being devoured by birds and worms, $[And the signs of] bones and bone joints linked together. 
$After cultivating the signs in this way, $He returns to his former place, $Washes his hands and feet, $Spreads his sitting mat, and sits upright on it. 
$[He] should contemplate, as it truly is, $The body, both internally and externally, $Filled with excrement and urine, $With heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, and so on. 
$If, wanting to do the almsround, $He goes to a village or town, $Then, like a general clad in his armor, $He constantly keeps right mindfulness before him. 
$If he sees a visible form as desirable, $Associated purely with desire, $Then, seeing this, he contemplates it as it really is, $With right mindfulness of the Buddha and his Dharma and discipline. 
$109^taisho647a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Herein [he contemplates] not bones and tendons, $Not flesh and not blood, $Not kidneys, heart, liver, and lungs, $Not tears, saliva, brain; $[Rather, he contemplates] it all as the earth [element], totally empty, $And [as] the water element in the same way. 
$Empty entirely is the fire element, $The wind element too is empty. 
$If there are any feelings $Associated purely with desire, $He stills them all, $And contemplates them as the wise ones do. 
$In this way he practices energetically, $Constantly recollecting the perception of impurity. 
$He totally removes sensual passion, hatred, and delusion. 
$Discarding all ignorance, $And arousing pure understanding, $The monk attains the end of dukkha.

$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $Of all kinds of livelihood, the lowliest one by far is begging for almsfood. 
$Worldly people shun it vehemently, speaking of bald-pated ones walking $around holding out their bowls. 
[Yet some] of those clansmen accept it $as beneficial. 
Why is that? Because of disenchantment with birth, aging, $disease, death, grief, worry, weeping, sorrow, and distress [they think], $“Perhaps by this means I can achieve the ending of this entire great mass $of dukkha.” Didn’t you have such an intention when you went forth to $train in the path? $110$Division 11$Then the monks answered, “That is so.” $The World-honored One addressed the monks further: $Ignorant fools may go forth to train in the path with a similar intention, $and yet they are serving their desires. 
They are very heavily contaminated $with attachment, mentally polluted and entangled with hatred, envy, and $lack of faith. 
Negligent, lacking right mindfulness, without right concen￾tration, with their minds deranged by stupidity and with their faculties $distracted, they keep the precepts very loosely. 
They are not cultivating $[the path of] a renunciant and do not advance in their practice. 
$It is as if a person were [trying] to wash out an ink stain with ink, to $remove blood with blood, to remove filth with filth, to remove turbidity $with turbidity, or to remove excrement with excrement.95 [This person] $is thereby merely increasing the impurity, [going] from obscurity into $obscurity, from darkness into darkness. 
$It is the same, I say, with ignorant fools [very loosely] keeping the pre￾cepts of a renunciant. 
That is to say, these people are serving their desires. 
$They are very heavily contaminated with attachment, mentally polluted $and entangled with hatred, envy, and lack of faith. 
Negligent, lacking right $mindfulness, without right concentration, with their minds deranged by $stupidity and their faculties distracted, they keep the precepts very loosely. 
$They are not cultivating [the path of] a renunciant and do not advance in $their practice. 
$It is like the remnants of wood left over from a cremation place in a $forest; the burned-out cinders are of no use in the forest and of no use in $a village or town.

$Then the World-honored One uttered these verses: $111^taisho647b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Ignorant fools lose the desires and pleasures [of sensuality] $And also lose the benefits of being a renunciant. 
$They completely lose out on both sides, $Just like the cinders remaining from a fire. 
$Just as in a forest $The cinders remaining from a cremation fire, $Are of no use in either forest or village, $So it is with a person who has attachment and desire.

At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha, on $Mount Vulture Peak. 
$At that time King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha harbored hatred for $Vajji. 
He repeatedly said to his retainers: $The people of the Vajji country have great might, great virtue, great merit, $great power; [yet] I will exterminate the Vajji clan, destroy Vajji, and cause $the Vajji people to meet with immeasurable misfortune. 
$Then King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha heard that the World-hon￾ored One was staying at Rājagaha, on Mount Vulture Peak. 
He said to his $chief minister Vassakāra: $I hear that the renunciant Gotama is staying at Rājagaha, on Mount Vulture $Peak. 
Vassakāra, approach the renunciant Gotama and in my name politely $inquire whether the noble one is at ease and without illness in the body $and whether his strength is as usual. 
Say this, “Gotama, King Ajātasattu $Vedehiputta of Magadha inquires whether the noble one is at ease and $without illness in the body and whether his strength is as usual. 
$“Gotama, King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha harbors hatred for $Vajji.

$Having received these instructions from the king, the chief minister Vas￾sakāra mounted a most beautiful chariot, went out of the town of Rājagaha $115^taisho648b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$in the company of five hundred chariots, and headed for Mount Vulture Peak. 
$Having gone up to Mount Vulture Peak, he descended from the chariot and $approached the Buddha on foot. 
He exchanged polite greetings with the $World-honored One, stepped back, sat to one side, and said: $Gotama, King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha inquires whether the $noble one is at ease and without illness in the body and whether your $strength is as usual.

Vassakāra, at that time I taught the people of the $Vajji country seven principles for non-decline, and the people of the Vajji $country were able to accept and implement those seven principles for $non-decline. 
Vassakāra, if the people of the Vajji country implement the $seven principles for non-decline and do not violate them, then Vajji will $certainly excel; it will not decline. 
$The chief minister Vassakāra said to the World-honored One: $The renunciant Gotama has spoken of this matter in brief, without expound￾ing the details. 
We are unable to understand its meaning. 
May the renun￾ciant Gotama expound the details, so that we can come to understand the $meaning. 
$The World-honored One said, “Vassakāra, listen closely and pay proper $attention, I will explain the meaning in detail to you.” The chief minister $Vassakāra listened to receive the instruction. 
$At that time, Venerable Ānanda was holding a fan and attending on the $Buddha.

$Then the chief minister Vassakāra rose from his seat, arranged his clothes $119$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$so as to bare one shoulder, extended his hands with palms joined toward the $Buddha, and said: $Gotama, if those Vajjis had accomplished just one of the principles for $non-decline, then King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha would not be $able to overcome them—let alone being endowed with all seven principles $for non-decline!

$Venerable Ānanda received the instruction from the Buddha, [saying,] $“Yes, World-honored One.” $Then Venerable Ānanda made this announcement, “Whatever monks are $dwelling in the various places on Mount Vulture Peak should now all gather $in the assembly hall!” When they had all gathered there, he returned to the $Buddha, paid homage with his head, stepped back, and stood to one side.

If a monk undertakes bodily deeds of loving-kindness $toward his companions in the holy life, this is a principle of cordiality, a $principle of affection, a principle that delights; it results in affection, in $being valued, in being respected, in being revered, in being cultivated, in $being included; it leads to being a [true] renunciant, to attaining unification $of the mind, to attaining energy, and to attaining nirvana. 
$In the same way, undertaking verbal deeds of loving-kindness ...
$mental deeds of loving-kindness ...
sharing one’s gains gotten in accor￾dance with the Dharma, one’s own food, even what is in one’s bowl, by $giving to one’s companions in the holy life, this is a principle of cordiality, $a principle of affection, a principle that delights; it results in affection, in $being valued, in being respected, in being revered, in being cultivated, in $being included; it leads to being a [true] renunciant, to attaining unification $of the mind, to attaining energy, and to attaining nirvana. 
$If one has moral discipline that is not deficient, not defective, not $defiled, not blackened; if one is [firm] like the earth, not swayed by others, $praised by the noble ones, endowed with it and accepting and upholding $it well, then sharing such moral discipline with one’s companions in the $holy life is a principle of cordiality, a principle of affection, a principle $that delights, that results in affection, in being valued, in being respected, 650b in being revered, in being cultivated, in being included. 
It leads to becoming $a [true] renunciant, to attaining unification of the mind, to attaining energy, $and to attaining nirvana. 
$If one has the vision that is a noble release, a deep understanding that $is able rightly to eradicate dukkha, then sharing such vision with one’s $companions in the holy life is a principle of cordiality, a principle of affec￾tion, a principle that delights; it results in affection, in being valued, in $being respected, in being revered, in being cultivated, in being included; $it leads to becoming a [true] renunciant, to attaining unification of the $mind, to attaining energy, and to attaining nirvana. 
$When I spoke earlier of six principles of cordiality, it was in relation $to this that I spoke. 
$Thus said the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks $were delighted and received it respectfully. 
$125$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$143. 
^ck The Discourse to Saṅgārava111$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the young brahmin Saṅgārava, while roaming around in the $afternoon, approached the Buddha and exchanged friendly greetings. 
He $stepped back, sat to one side, and said, “Gotama, I would like to ask a question. 
$Will you listen if I venture to express it?” $The World-honored One said, “Young brahmin, feel free to ask about $what you are in doubt.” $Then the young brahmin Saṅgārava asked: $Gotama, a brahmin, in accordance with [brahmin] custom, goes begging $for wealth [and then] either performs a sacrifice himself or gets [someone $else] to perform a sacrifice. 
Gotama, whether he performs the sacrifice $himself or gets [someone else] to perform the sacrifice, in either case he $produces countless meritorious effects through the sacrifice. 
$A disciple of the renunciant Gotama, in accordance with his clan’s cus￾tom, shaves off hair and beard, dons the yellow robes and, out of faith, $gives up the household life and becomes homeless to train in the path. 
$He [only] tames himself, attains peace himself, and attains extinction him￾self. 
In this way disciples of the renunciant Gotama who follow their $clan’s custom produce only a single meritorious effect; they do not produce $countless meritorious effects through training in the path.112$At that time Venerable Ānanda was holding a fan and attending on the $Buddha. 
Then Venerable Ānanda asked, “Young brahmin, of these two ways $of practice, which is the superior, the more superb, the more excellent?” $The young brahmin Saṅgārava said, “Ānanda, I revere, honor, and venerate $the renunciants Gotama and Ānanda.” $Venerable Ānanda said again: $Young brahmin, I did not ask whom you revere, honor, and venerate. 
$Rather, I asked you: of these two ways of practice, which is the superior, $the more superb, the more excellent? $Venerable Ānanda asked three times, “Young brahmin, of these two ways $of practice, which is the superior, the more superb, the more excellent?” $126$Division 12$127$The young brahmin Saṅgārava also said three times, “Ānanda, I revere, $honor, and venerate the renunciants Gotama and Ānanda.” $Venerable Ānanda said again: $Young brahmin, I did not ask whom you revere, honor, and venerate. 
$Rather, I asked you: of these two ways of practice, which is the superior, $the more superb, the more excellent? $Then the World-honored One thought, “This young brahmin Saṅgārava $has been cornered by Ānanda. 
Let me rescue him.” $Knowing this, the World-honored One said: $Young brahmin, in former days, when the king and his courtiers gathered $for a great assembly, what matter would they discuss? For what matter $would they assemble? $The young brahmin Saṅgārava replied: $Gotama, in former days, when the king and his courtiers gathered for a $great assembly, they would discuss this matter: “What is the cause, what $is the reason why the renunciant Gotama formerly laid down few rules, $yet many monks attained awakening? What is the cause, what is the reason $why the renunciant Gotama now lays down many rules, yet only a few $monks attain awakening?”113 Gotama, in former days, when the king and $his courtiers gathered for a great assembly, they would discuss this matter. 
$Because of this matter they would assemble. 
$Then the World-honored One said: $Young brahmin, I will now ask you. 
Answer in accordance with your $understanding. 
What do you think? Suppose that a renunciant or brahmin $themselves walk a path, a track such that, having walked this path, having $walked this track, they eradicate all taints and attain the taintless liberation $of the mind and liberation by wisdom, and dwell knowing by themselves, $awakening by themselves, realizing by themselves: “Birth is ended, the $holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, there $will not be another experiencing of existence,” knowing it as it really is. 
$They tell others, “I myself undertook a path, a track such that, having $walked this path, having walked this track, I eradicated all taints and ^taisho650c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$128$attained the taintless liberation of the mind and liberation by wisdom, and $I dwell having known by myself, having awakened by myself, having $realized by myself: ‘Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, $what had to be done has been done, there will not be another experiencing $of existence,’ knowing it as it really is. 
$“Come, all of you, and walk by yourselves a path, a track such that, $having walked this path, having walked this track, you will eradicate all $taints and attain the taintless liberation of the mind and liberation by wis￾dom, and will dwell knowing by yourselves, awakening by yourselves, $realizing by yourselves: ‘Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, $what had to be done has been done, there will not be another experiencing $of existence,’ knowing it as it really is.” $They themselves also walk a path, a track such that, having walked $this path, having walked this track, they eradicate all taints and attain the $taintless liberation of the mind and liberation by wisdom, and they dwell $having known by themselves, having awakened by themselves, having $realized by themselves, “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, $what had to be done has been done, there will not be another experiencing $of existence,” knowing it as it really is. 
$They tell others, and those others tell others, and so on in turn to count￾less hundreds and thousands [of others]. 
What do you think, young brah￾min? My disciples who follow their clan’s custom by shaving off hair and $beard, donning the yellow robes and, out of faith, give up the household $life and become homeless to train in the path—do they produce only a $single meritorious effect? Do they not produce countless meritorious $effects by training in the path? $The young brahmin Saṅgārava replied: $Gotama, as I understand the meaning of what the renunciant Gotama has $said, the disciples of the renunciant Gotama, who follow their clan’s $custom by shaving off hair and beard, donning the yellow robes and, out $of faith, give up the household life and become homeless to train in the $path—they produce countless meritorious effects. 
They do not produce $only a single meritorious effect by training in the path. 
^taisho651a Division 12$The World-honored One further said to Saṅgārava: $There are three types of miracle: the miracle of supernormal powers, the $miracle of divining the thoughts [of others], and the miracle of instruction. 
$Young brahmin, what is the miracle of supernormal powers? Here a $renunciant or brahmin has great supernormal powers, great and mighty $virtue, great merit, great divine might. 
His mind has mastery of supernormal $powers and engages in the virtues of immeasurable supernormal powers, $namely, being one, he becomes many; being many, he becomes one [again]. 
$Being one, he remains one, possessing knowledge and possessing vision. 
$He passes unhindered through stone walls as if passing through space. 
$He dives into the earth as if it were water; he walks on water [without $sinking] as if it were earth. 
Seated cross-legged, he ascends into space $like a bird. 
With his hand he touches and strokes the sun and the moon, $which are of such great supernormal power, of such great and mighty $virtue, of such great merit, of such great divine might. 
With his body he $reaches the Brahmā world. 
Young brahmin, this is called the miracle of $supernormal powers. 
$Young brahmin, what is the miracle of divining the thoughts [of others]? $Here a renunciant or brahmin uses another person’s outward appearance $as a basis for divining that other person’s mind to be like this [or like that]. 
$If [he divines] that mind to be like this [or like that], then it really is like $this [or like that]. 
He makes countless divinations, not just a few divina￾tions, and all of them are correct; none is false. 
$If he does not divine another person’s mind on the basis of that other $person’s outward appearance, then he instead divines that person’s mind $to be a mind like this [or like that] by hearing the sound of devas or the $sound of [other] non-human beings. 
If [he divines] it to be a mind like $this [or like that], then it really is a mind like this [or like that]. 
He makes $countless divinations, not just a few divinations, and all of them are correct; $none is false. 
$If he does not divine another person’s mind on the basis of that other $person’s outward appearance, and also not by hearing the sound of devas $or the sound of [other] non-human beings, then he instead divines that $person’s mind to be like this [or like that] on the basis of that other person’s $129$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$thoughts, his intentions, and what he says. 
On hearing [that person’s] $voice, [he divines] his mind to be like this [or like that]. 
If he divines it $to be a mind like this [or like that], then it really is a mind like this [or $like that]. 
He makes countless divinations, not just a few divinations, and $all of them are correct; none is false. 
$If he does not divine another person’s mind on the basis of that other $person’s outward appearance, and also not by hearing the sound of devas $or the sound of [other] nonhuman beings, and also not on the basis of that $other person’s thoughts, his intentions, and what he says, nor on hearing $his voice, then he instead divines that other person’s mind by seeing them $enter the concentration that is without [directed] awareness and [sustained] $contemplation. 
Having seen this, he thinks, “In this state the venerable $one is not thinking and not intending, [yet] his mind has such-and-such $inclinations. 
[When] that venerable one emerges from this concentration, $he will think like this [and like that].” On emerging from this concentration $that one does [indeed] think like this and like that. 
$[A renunciant or brahmin] may also divine the past, the future, and the $present: what was done long ago and said long ago. 
He may also divine $[the mind of someone who is] in a quiet place, dwelling in a quiet place, $even divining his mind states and his mind objects. 
Young brahmin, this $is called the miracle of divining the thoughts [of others]. 
$Young brahmin, what is the miracle of instruction? Here a renunciant or $brahmin themselves walk a path, a track such that, having walked this path, $having walked this track, they eradicate all taints and attain the taintless lib￾eration of the mind and liberation by wisdom, and dwell knowing by them￾selves, awakening by themselves, realizing by themselves: “Birth is ended, $the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done; there $will not be another experiencing of existence,” knowing it as it really is. 
$They tell others, “I myself walked a path, a track such that, having $walked this path, having walked this track, I eradicated all taints and $attained the taintless liberation of the mind and liberation by wisdom, and $I dwell having known by myself, having awakened by myself, having $realized by myself, ‘Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, $what had to be done has been done; there will not be another experiencing $of existence,’ knowing it as it really is. 
$130^taisho651b Division 12$“Come, all of you, and also walk such a path yourselves, a track such $that, having walked this path, having walked this track, you will eradicate $all taints and attain the taintless liberation of the mind and liberation by $wisdom, and dwell knowing by yourselves, awakening by yourselves, $realizing by yourselves: ‘Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, $what had to be done has been done; there will not be another experiencing $of existence,’ knowing it as it really is.” $They themselves also walk such a path, a track such that, having walked $this path, having walked this track, they eradicate all taints and attain the $taintless liberation of the mind and liberation by wisdom, and dwell having $known by themselves, having awakened by themselves, having realized $by themselves: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what $had to be done has been done; there will not be another experiencing of $existence,” knowing it as it really is. 
$They tell others, and those others tell others, and so on in turn to count￾less hundreds and thousands [of others]. 
Young brahmin, this is what is $called the miracle of instruction.114 Of these three miracles, which miracle $is the best, the most superb, the most excellent? $The young brahmin Saṅgārava replied: $Gotama, suppose that a renunciant or brahmin has great supernormal powers, $great and mighty virtue, great merit, great divine might. 
His mind has mastery $of supernormal powers ...
up to ...
with his body he reaches the Brahmā$world. 
Gotama, this is done for himself and is possessed by himself; he $himself receives the fruit of it. 
Gotama, this miracle is [nevertheless] a great $method among these miracles.115$Gotama, suppose that a renunciant or brahmin divines the minds of others $based on their outward appearance ...
up to ...
he divines their mind states $and their mind objects. 
Gotama, this too is done for himself and is possessed $by himself; he himself receives the fruit of it. 
Gotama, this miracle is [nev￾ertheless] a great method among these miracles. 
$Gotama, suppose that a renunciant or brahmin himself walks such a path, $a track such that, having walked this path, having walked this track, he erad￾icates all taints and attains the taintless liberation of the mind and liberation $by wisdom, and dwells having known by himself, having awakened by $131^taisho651c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$himself, having realized by himself: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been $established, what had to be done has been done; there will not be another $experiencing of existence,” knowing it as it really is. 
He tells others, those $others tell others, and so on in turn to countless hundreds and thousands $[of others]. 
Gotama, among these three miracles, this miracle is the best, $the most superb, the most excellent. 
$The World-honored One asked Saṅgārava, “Of these three miracles, for $which miracle would your praise [someone]?” $The young brahmin Saṅgārava replied: $Gotama, I praise the renunciant Gotama for [each of] these three miracles. 
$Why is that? The renunciant Gotama has great supernormal powers, great $and mighty virtue, great merit, great divine might. 
His mind has mastery of $supernormal powers ...
up to ...
with his body he reaches the Brahmā world. 
$The renunciant Gotama divines the minds of others on the basis of $their outward appearance ...
up to ...
he divines their mind states and $their mind objects. 
$The renunciant Gotama [manifests] the miracle of [teaching] a path, $a track such that, having walked this path, having walked this track, one $eradicates all taints and attains the taintless liberation of the mind and lib￾eration by wisdom, and dwells knowing by oneself, awakening by oneself, $realizing by oneself: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, $what had to be done has been done; there will not be another experiencing $of existence,” knowing it as it really is. 
The renunciant Gotama tells others, $those others tell others, and so on in turn to countless hundreds and thou￾sands [of others]. 
Gotama, for this reason, in relation to these three miracles, $I praise the renunciant Gotama. 
$Then the World-honored One said: $Young brahmin, you have penetrated this discussion well.116 Why is that? $I have great supernormal powers, great and mighty virtue, great merit, $great divine might.

$132$Division 12$Young brahmin, I have myself walked a path, a track such that, having $walked this path, having walked this track, I eradicated all taints and $attained the taintless liberation of the mind and liberation by wisdom, and $I dwell having known by myself, having awakened by myself, having $realized by myself: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, $what had to be done has been done; there will not be another experiencing $of existence,” knowing it as it really is. 
$I tell others, those others tell others, and so on in turn to countless hun￾dreds and thousands [of others]. 
$Young brahmin, for this reason you have penetrated this discussion $well. 
You should receive it well like this and keep it well in mind. 
Why $is that? The meaning of what has been said is just like this. 
$Then the young brahmin Saṅgārava said: $World-honored One, I have understood. 
Well-gone One, I have compre￾hended. 
World-honored One, from now on I go for refuge to the Buddha, $the Dharma, and the Sangha of monks. 
May the World-honored One accept $me as a lay disciple from this day forth until life ends, as having personally $gone for refuge for my whole life. 
$Thus said the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the young $brahmin Saṅgārava, Venerable Ānanda, and the [other] monks were delighted $and received it respectfully.

^ck The Discourse to Gaṇaka $Moggallāna117$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in the $Eastern Park, the Hall of Migāra’s Mother. 
$At that time the brahmin Gaṇaka Moggallāna, while roaming around in $the afternoon, approached the Buddha and exchanged friendly greetings. 
He $stepped back, sat to one side, and said, “Gotama, I would like to ask a question. 
$Will you listen if I venture to express it?” $The World-honored One said, “Moggallāna, feel free to ask. 
Let no doubt $trouble you.” $Then Gaṇaka Moggallāna asked: $133^taisho652a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Gotama, this Hall of Migāra’s Mother was constructed gradually, by stages, $until it reached completion. 
Gotama, within this Hall of Migāra’s Mother $one ascends by the ladders first to the first level, and after that to the $second, third, and fourth levels. 
Gotama, in this way one ascends gradually $within the Hall of Migāra’s Mother. 
$Gotama, for elephant trainers there is a gradual training until completion, $namely by means of the hook. 
Gotama, for horse trainers there is also a $gradual training until completion, namely by means of the halter.118 Gotama, $for warriors there is also a gradual training until completion, namely by $means of grasping bow and arrow. 
Gotama, for brahmins there is also a $gradual training until completion, namely by means of learning the texts. 
$Gotama, in our learning of accountancy, in order to make a living by $accounting, there is also a gradual training until completion. 
If we have $an apprentice, whether male or female, we first teach him or her one one, $two twos, three threes, [and so on to the] tens, hundreds, thousands, and $ten thousands, gradually going upward. 
Gotama, thus in our learning of $accountancy, in order to make a living by accounting, there is a gradual $training until completion. 
Renunciant Gotama, in this Dharma and disci￾pline [of yours], is there a gradual training until completion? $The Word-honored One said: $Moggallāna, rightly speaking, there is a gradual training until completion. 
$Moggallāna, this is rightly said of my Dharma and discipline. 
Why is $that? Moggallāna, in my Dharma and discipline there is a gradual training $until completion. 
$Moggallāna, when a young monk first comes to train in the path, one $who is just entering this Dharma and discipline, the Tathāgata first instructs $him, “Come, monk, with your body guard the purity of your livelihood, $with your speech ...
with your mind guard the purity of your liveli￾hood.”119$Moggallāna, suppose a monk guards the purity of his livelihood with $the body, guards the purity of his livelihood with speech ...
and mind. 
$Then the Tathāgata instructs him further, “Come, monk, contemplate $the body as a body internally ...
up to ...
contemplate feelings ...
states $of mind ...
dharmas as dharmas.” $134^taisho652b Division 12$Moggallāna, suppose a monk contemplates the body as a body inter￾nally ...
up to ...
contemplates feelings ...
states of mind ...
dharmas $as dharmas. 
$Then the Tathāgata instructs him further, “Come, monk, contemplate $the body as a body internally and do not think thoughts related to sen￾suality ...
up to ...
contemplate feelings ...
states of mind ...
dharmas $as dharmas and do not think thoughts that are not in accordance with the $Dharma.” $Moggallāna, suppose a monk contemplates the body as a body internally $and does not think thoughts related to sensuality ...
up to ...
contemplates $feelings ...
states of mind ...
dharmas as dharmas and does not think $thoughts that are not in accordance with the Dharma. 
$Then the Tathāgata instructs him further, “Come, monk, guard the sense $faculties, always being mindful of stopping thoughts of sensuality with $clear understanding. 
Successfully guard the mind through mindfulness, $constantly arousing right comprehension. 
On seeing a form with the eye, $do not cling to its appearance; do not savor the form. 
That is to say, for the $sake of restraint, guard the eye faculty so that no covetousness or sorrow, $evil and unwholesome states, arise in the mind. 
For progress in that, guard $the eye faculty. 
In the same way, [on hearing a sound] with the ear ...
$[smelling an odor] with the nose ...
[tasting a flavor] with the tongue ...
$[experiencing a tangible] with the body ...
coming to know a mental object $with the mind, do not cling to its appearance, do not savor the mental $object. 
That is to say, for the sake of restraint, guard the mind faculty so $that no covetousness or sorrow, evil and unwholesome states, arise in the $mind. 
For progress in that, guard the mind faculty.”120$Moggallāna, suppose a monk guards the sense faculties and is always $mindful of stopping thoughts of sensuality with clear understanding; he $successfully guards the mind through mindfulness, constantly arousing $right comprehension; on seeing a form with the eye, he does not cling to $its appearance, does not savor the form; that is to say, for the sake of $restraint, he guards the eye faculty so that no covetousness or sorrow, evil $and unwholesome states, arise in the mind; for progress in that, he guards $the eye faculty; in the same way, on [hearing a sound] with the ear ...
$[smelling an odor] with the nose ...
[tasting a flavor] with the tongue ...
$135$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$136$[experiencing a tangible] with the body ...
coming to know a mental object $with the mind, he does not cling to its appearance, does not savor the mental $object; that is to say, for the sake of restraint, he guards the mind faculty $so that no covetousness or sorrow, evil and unwholesome states, arise in $the mind; in order to progress in that, he guards the mind faculty. 
$Then the Tathāgata instructs him further, “Come, monk, have right $comprehension when going out or coming in, contemplate and distinguish $well when bending or stretching [the limbs], when lowering or raising $[the head]; with orderly manners and appearance, carry properly the outer $robe, the other robes, and the bowl; when walking, standing, sitting, and $reclining, when going to sleep or waking up, when speaking or keeping $silent, always have right comprehension.”121$Moggallāna, suppose a monk has right comprehension when going out $or coming in, contemplates and distinguishes well when bending or stretch￾ing [the limbs], when lowering or raising [the head]; with orderly manners $and appearance, he carries properly the outer robe, the other robes, and $the bowl; when walking, standing, sitting, and reclining, when going to $sleep or waking up, when speaking or keeping silent, he always has right $comprehension. 
$Then the Tathāgata instructs him further, “Come, monk, dwell alone $in seclusion. 
Stay in a forest area or go to the base of a tree in an empty $peaceful place, to a mountain cave, to a heap of straw in an open place, $or go into a forest, or stay in a cemetery. 
Staying in a forest or having $gone to the base of a tree in an empty peaceful place, you spread out the $sitting mat and sit down cross-legged with body erect, with right mental $aspiration and undivided mindfulness. 
$“Abandon and remove covetousness. 
With a mind free from agitation, $on seeing others’ wealth and requisites of life, do not give rise to cov￾etousness, wishing, ‘May I get it!’ Purify your mind of covetousness. 
In $the same way abandon ill will ...

abandon doubt, transcend uncertainty, become free from vac￾illation in regard to wholesome states. 
Purify your mind of doubt. 
$“Abandon these five hindrances, which defile the mind and weaken $wisdom. 
Secluded from sensual desires, secluded from evil and unwhole￾some states ...
up to ...
dwell having attained the fourth absorption.” ^taisho652c Division 12$Moggallāna, suppose that a monk, secluded from sensual desires, $secluded from evil and unwholesome states ...
up to ...
dwells having $attained the fourth absorption. 
Moggallāna, [in this way] the Tathāgata is $of much benefit to new monks, by instructing and teaching them. 
$Moggallāna, if there are monks who are elders, highly regarded, sea￾soned practitioners of the holy life, then the Tathāgata teaches them further, $namely regarding final knowledge, the complete and total eradication of $the taints. 
$Gaṇaka Moggallāna asked again: $Renunciant Gotama, do all disciples, on being instructed like this and $taught like this, completely attain final knowledge, certainly [attaining] $nirvana? $The World-honored One replied, “Moggallāna, not all attain it. 
Some $attain it, some do not attain it.” $Gaṇaka Moggallāna asked again: $Gotama, what is the cause here, what is the reason why, [although] there $is nirvana, and there is the path to nirvana, and the renunciant Gotama is $at present the guiding teacher, yet some monks, being instructed like this, $taught like this, attain final knowledge, nirvana, and some do not attain it? $The World-honored One replied: $Moggallāna, I will ask you in return. 
Answer according to your under￾standing. 
Moggallāna, what do you think? Do you know the location of $the city of Rājagaha and are you well acquainted with the road to it? $Gaṇaka Moggallāna replied, “Indeed, I know the location of the city of $Rājagaha and I am well acquainted with the road to it.” $The World-honored One asked: $Moggallāna, suppose that someone comes by wishing to visit the king, $to reach the city of Rājagaha. 
That person asks you, “I wish to visit the $king and reach Rājagaha. 
Gaṇaka Moggallāna, do you know the location $of the city of Rājagaha? Are you well acquainted with the road to it? Can $you show it to me and explain it?” $137$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$You tell that person, “From here go to the east until you reach a certain $village; going on from that village, you will reach a certain town; contin￾uing in this way you will reach the city of Rājagaha. 
On the outskirts of $the city of Rājagaha there are beautiful parks on level ground, with watch￾towers and bathing places, with various kinds of flowering trees, located $between flowing rivers and clear springs. 
All of these you will see and $recognize.” $Having heard your words and received your instructions, [this person] $heads east from here and soon, before long, leaves the correct road and $follows a wrong road heading in the opposite direction. 
The beautiful $parks on level ground on the outskirts of the city of Rājagaha, with watch￾towers and bathing places, with various kinds of flowering trees, located $between flowing rivers and clear springs—all of these [the person] does $not see, does not recognize. 
$Someone else comes by wishing to visit the king, to reach the city of $Rājagaha, and that person asks you, “I wish to visit the king and reach $Rājagaha. 
Gaṇaka Moggallāna, do you know the location of the city of $Rājagaha? Are you well acquainted with the road to it? Can you show it $to me and explain it?” $You tell that person, “From here go to the east until you reach a certain $village; going on from that village, you will reach a certain town; contin￾uing in this way you will reach the city of Rājagaha. 
On the outskirts of $the city of Rājagaha there are beautiful parks on level ground, with watch￾towers and bathing places, with various kinds of flowering trees, located $between flowing rivers and clear springs. 
All of these you will see and $recognize.” $Having heard your words and received your instructions, [the person] $heads east from here until they reach that village, from that village they $go until they reach the town, and so on in this way until they reach the $city of Rājagaha. 
The beautiful parks on level ground on the outskirts of $the city of Rājagaha, with watchtowers and bathing places, with various $kinds of flowering trees, located between flowing rivers and clear springs—$all of these they see and recognize. 
$Moggallāna, what is the cause here, what is the reason why, [given $that] there is that city of Rājagaha, there is the road to the city of Rājagaha, $138^taisho653a Division 12$and you are at present the guiding teacher, yet the first person following $the instructions they received from you, left the correct road before long $and followed a wrong road in the opposite direction, and did not at all get $to see and recognize the beautiful parks on level ground on the outskirts $of the city of Rājagaha, with watchtowers and bathing places, with various $kinds of flowering trees, located between flowing rivers and clear springs? $[And what is the cause here, what is the reason why] the second person, $following the instructions they received from you, following the correct $level road and so on, was able to reach the city of Rājagaha, and got to $see and recognize the beautiful parks on level ground on the outskirts of $the city of Rājagaha, with watchtowers and bathing places, with various $kinds of flowering trees, located between flowing rivers and clear springs? $Gaṇaka Moggallāna replied: $Gotama, it has nothing at all to do with me. 
There is the city of Rājagaha, $there is the road to the city of Rājagaha, and I am at present the guiding $teacher. 
That first person did not follow my instructions. 
Before long they $left the correct road and followed a wrong road in the opposite direction; $[consequently] they did not at all get to see and recognize the beautiful 653b parks on level ground on the outskirts of the city of Rājagaha, with watch￾towers and bathing places, with various kinds of flowering trees, located $between flowing rivers and clear springs.122$That second person followed the instructions they received from me, $following the right level road and so on they were able to reach the city $of Rājagaha, and they got to see and recognize all the beautiful parks on $level ground on the outskirts of the city of Rājagaha, with watchtowers $and bathing places, with various kinds of flowering trees, located between $flowing rivers and clear springs. 
$The World-honored One said: $In the same way, Moggallāna, it also has nothing to do with me. 
There is $nirvana, there is the path to nirvana, I am the guiding teacher, yet some $monks, being instructed like this, taught like this, attain final knowledge, $nirvana, and some do not attain it. 
Moggallāna, each monk follows the $practice by themselves. 
At that time the World-honored One has merely $139$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$140$declared that practice, namely [what leads to] complete eradication of the $taints. 
$Gaṇaka Moggallāna said: $Gotama, I have understood. 
Gotama, I have comprehended. 
Gotama, it is $just as if there were a grove of sāla trees growing on good ground and in it $there was a guardian of the sāla tree grove, who is intelligent, healthy, and $not lazy. 
At appropriate times [the guardian] digs around the roots of the sāla trees with a hoe, making the ground level. 
[The guardian] puts down fertilizer $and waters the trees, never missing the time for it. 
If bad weeds grow beside $the trees, [the guardian] pulls them all out and discards them. 
$If there are [trees] that are growing sideways or crookedly, ones that $are not growing straight, [the guardian] prunes and trains them all. 
If there $are straight and very beautiful trees among them, [the guardian] nourishes $and protects them, according to the season, hoeing, fertilizing, and watering $them, without missing the time for it. 
In this way the sāla tree grove on $good ground flourishes and becomes beautiful.123$Gotama, in the same way there are persons who are hypocritical and $deceitful, completely lacking in generosity, without faith, lazy, without $mindfulness, without concentration, stupid, crazy-minded, with their fac￾ulties in disorder, lax in adhering to the precepts, who do not extensively $cultivate [the way of] the renunciant. 
Gotama, with such persons it is not $possible to work. 
Why is that? Gotama, such persons defile the holy life. 
$Gotama, again there are persons who are not hypocritical and not deceit￾ful, who have generosity and faith, who are energetic and not lazy, who $have mindfulness, have concentration, and have wisdom, who respect the $precepts to the utmost and extensively cultivate [the way of] the renunciant. 
$Gotama, with such persons it is possible to work. 
Why is that? Gotama, $such persons maintain the purity of the holy life. 
$Gotama, it is just as aloe root is foremost among fragrant roots. 
Why $is that? Gotama, it is because aloe root is supreme among fragrant roots. 
$Gotama, it is just as red sandalwood is foremost among fragrant sāla trees. 
Why is that? Gotama, it is because red sandalwood is supreme $among fragrant sāla trees. 
653c$Division 12$141$Gotama, it is just as the blue lotus is foremost among all flowers that $grow in water. 
Why is that? Gotama, it is because the blue lotus is supreme $among all flowers that grow in water. 
$Gotama, it is just as jasmine is foremost among all flowers that grow $on land. 
Why is that? Gotama, it is because jasmine is supreme among $all flowers that grow on land.124$Gotama, it is just as the renunciant Gotama is foremost among teachers $in the world. 
Why is that? It is because the renunciant Gotama is able to $outdo in debate all practitioners of heterodox teachings. 
World-honored $One, from now on I go for refuge to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the $Sangha of monks. 
May the World-honored One accept me as a lay disciple $from this day forth until life ends as having personally gone for refuge $for my whole life. 
$Thus said the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, Gaṇaka Mog￾gallāna and the monks were delighted and received it respectfully. 
$145. 
^ck The Discourse to Gopaka $Moggallāna125$Thus have I heard. 
At one time, not long after the Buddha had attained final $nirvana, Venerable Ānanda was staying at Rājagaha. 
$At that time Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, was governing the $city of Rājagaha, guarding it against the Vajjis.126 Then Vassakāra, the chief $minister of Magadha, had assigned Gopaka Moggallāna, the field watchman, $to [watch over] the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. 
$At that time, when the night was over, at dawn, Venerable Ānanda put on $his [outer] robe and took his bowl, wishing to enter Rājagaha to beg for alms￾food.127 Venerable Ānanda thought, “For the time being, never mind about $begging for almsfood in Rājagaha. 
Let me instead approach Gopaka Mog￾gallāna, the field watchman.” Then Venerable Ānanda approached Gopaka $Moggallāna, the field watchman. 
$On seeing Venerable Ānanda coming in the distance, the brahmin Gopaka $Moggallāna rose from his seat, arranged his clothes so as to bare one shoulder, $extended his hands with joined palms toward Venerable Ānanda, and said, $“Welcome, Ānanda. 
For a long time you have not come here. 
Please sit on $this seat.” Venerable Ānanda sat on that seat. 
^taisho654a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$The brahmin Gopaka Moggallāna exchanged polite greetings with Ven￾erable Ānanda, stepped back, and sat to one side. 
He said, “Ānanda, I would $like to ask something. 
Will you listen to my question?” $Venerable Ānanda replied, “Moggallāna, you may ask it. 
On hearing it, $I will consider it.” $Then [Gopaka Moggallāna] asked, “Ānanda, is there any monk who is $the equal of the renunciant Gotama?”128$Just when Venerable Ānanda and the brahmin Gopaka Moggallāna were $discussing this matter together, Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, $[wishing] to encourage his field watchmen in their work, approached Gopaka $Moggallāna, the field watchman. 
Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, $saw in the distance Venerable Ānanda sitting with the brahmin Gopaka Mog￾gallāna, the field watchman. 
He approached Venerable Ānanda, exchanged $polite greetings, stepped back, and sat to one side. 
He asked, “Ānanda, what $matter have you been discussing with the brahmin Gopaka Moggallāna? For $what matter have you [two] come together here?” $Venerable Ānanda replied, “Vassakāra, the brahmin Gopaka Moggallāna $asked me, ‘Ānanda, is there any monk who is the equal of the renunciant $Gotama?’” $Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, asked further, “Ānanda, how $did you reply to him?” $Venerable Ānanda replied, “Vassakāra, there is no monk at all who is the $equal of the World-honored One.” $Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, asked further: $Yes indeed, Ānanda, there is no monk who is the equal of the World-hon￾ored One. 
Is there a monk who was appointed by the renunciant Gotama $when he was alive [thus]: “After my final nirvana, this monk should be $the refuge of all the monks,” so that you now take refuge in him? $Venerable Ānanda replied: $Vassakāra, there is no monk at all who was appointed by the World-honored $One, who knows and sees, the Tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awak￾ened, when he was alive [thus]: “After my final nirvana, this monk should $be the refuge of all the monks,” so that we now take refuge in him. 
$142$Division 12$Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, asked further: $Yes, indeed, Ānanda, there is no monk who is the equal of the World-hon￾ored One; and there is also no monk who was appointed by the renunciant $Gotama when he was alive [thus]: “After my final nirvana, this monk $should be the refuge of all the monks,” so that you now take refuge in him. 
$Is there, however, a monk who is honored by the assembly of the Sangha $[thus]: “After the World-honored One’s final nirvana, this monk should be 654b the refuge of all the monks,” so that you now take refuge in him? $Venerable Ānanda replied: $Vassakāra, there is no monk who is honored by the assembly of the Sangha $[thus]: “After the World-honored One’s final nirvana, this monk should be $the refuge of all the monks,” so that we now take refuge in him. 
$Vassakāra, the great minister of Magadha, asked further: $Yes indeed, Ānanda, there is no monk who is the equal of the World￾honored One; and there is also no monk who was appointed by the renun￾ciant Gotama when he was alive [thus]: “After my final nirvana, this monk $should be the refuge of all the monks,” so that you now take refuge in him; $and there is also no monk who is honored by the assembly of the Sangha $[thus]: “After the World-honored One’s final nirvana, this monk should be $the refuge of all the monks,” so that you now take refuge in him. 
$In that case, Ānanda, are you without a refuge [to ensure] communal $harmony, freedom from quarrel, peace, unity in a single teaching, blending $like water and milk, joyfully associating in practice, just as when the $renunciant Gotama was alive? $Venerable Ānanda replied, “Vassakāra, do not speak like this, saying that $we have no refuge. 
Why is that? We do indeed have a refuge.” $Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, said: $Ānanda, what you said earlier does not match what you have said later. 
$Until just now Ānanda said this, “There is no monk who is the equal of $the World-honored One; and there is also no monk whom the World-hon￾ored One, who knows and sees, the Tathāgata, free from attachment, fully $143$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$awakened, appointed when he was alive [thus]: ‘After my final nirvana, $this monk should be the refuge of all the monks,’ so that we now take $refuge in him; and there is also no monk who is honored by the assembly $of the Sangha [thus]: ‘After the World-honored One’s final nirvana, this $monk should be the refuge of all the monks,’ so that we now take refuge $in him.” Ānanda, what is the cause and condition that you now say, “We $do have a refuge”? $Venerable Ānanda replied: $Vassakāra, we do not take refuge in a person; we take refuge in the Dharma. 
$Vassakāra, if some of us are dwelling in reliance on a village or town, $then on the fifteenth day, at the time for reciting the code of rules, we $gather and sit in <one> place.129 If there is a certain monk who is knowl￾edgeable in the Dharma, we invite that monk to teach us the Dharma.130$If that sangha is pure, we all rejoice together and respectfully receive the $teachings of that monk. 
If there is an impure person in the sangha, we $instruct [the person] in accordance with what is set forth in the Dharma. 
$Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, said: $So, Ānanda, the instruction [to the impure monk] is given not by you, but $rather by the Dharma. 
In this way, Ānanda, with little or much of the $Dharma you can continue to exist for a long time. 
In this way, Ānanda, $you are in communal harmony, free of quarrel, at peace, at unity in a single $teaching, blending like water and milk, joyfully associating in practice, $just as when the renunciant Gotama was alive. 
$Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, asked further, “Ānanda, is there $someone that you [monks] respect?” $Venerable Ānanda replied, “Vassakāra, there is someone that we respect.” $Vassakāra said: $Ānanda, what you said earlier does not match what you have said later. 
$Until just now Ānanda said this, “There is no monk who is the equal of $the World-honored One; and there is also no monk whom the World-hon￾ored One, who knows and sees, the Tathāgata, free from attachment, fully $awakened, appointed when he was alive [thus]: ‘After my final nirvana, $144^taisho654c Division 12$this monk should be the refuge of all the monks,’ so that we now take $refuge in him; and there is also no monk who was honored by an assembly $of the Sangha [thus]: ‘After the World-honored One’s final nirvana, this $monk should be the refuge of all the monks,’ so that we now take refuge $in him.” Ānanda, what is the cause, what is the reason why you now say: $“There is someone that we respect”? $Venerable Ānanda replied: $Vassakāra, the World-honored One, who knows and sees, the Tathāgata, free $from attachment, fully awakened, taught us ten principles of respect. 
If we $see these ten principles in a monk, then we all revere him, respect him, $support him, esteem and emulate him, and show high regard for that monk. 
$What are the ten? Vassakāra, a monk cultivates morality and guards $[against breaking] the code of rules, adopts proper conduct and manners, $always dreading the slightest fault; he upholds the training in the precepts. 
$Vassakāra, if we see in a monk such superior practice of higher morality, $then we all revere him, respect him, support him, esteem and emulate $him, and show high regard for that monk. 
$Again, Vassakāra, a monk is widely trained in having learned much, $keeping it in mind, and not forgetting it. 
He has accumulated wide learning $of that which is called the Dharma, which is sublime in the beginning, $sublime in the middle, and also sublime in the end, with its meaning and $phrasing, endowed with purity, and revealing the holy life. 
Thus he is $widely trained in all [aspects] of the Dharma, has learnt much and has $recited and reviewed it a thousand times, reflected on it, and contemplated $it with clear vision and penetrative realization. 
Vassakāra, if we see in a $monk such superior learning, then we all revere him, respect him, support $him, esteem and emulate him, and show high regard for that monk.131$Again, Vassakāra, a monk acts as a good friend, acts as a good com￾panion, acts as a good comrade. 
Vassakāra, if we see in a monk such supe￾rior good friendship, then we all revere him, respect him, support him, $esteem and emulate him, and show high regard for that monk. 
$Again, Vassakāra, a monk delights in dwelling in seclusion and is $accomplished in the two types of seclusion, bodily and mental. 
Vassakāra, $if we see in a monk such superior delight in dwelling in seclusion, then 655a$145$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$we all revere him, respect him, support him, esteem and emulate him, and $show high regard for that monk. 
$Again, Vassakāra, a monk delights in sitting in meditation, properly $practices inner tranquility, is never separated from application of the mind, $is accomplished in insight and increasingly dwells in emptiness. 
Vassakāra, $if we see in a monk such superior delight in sitting in meditation, then we $all revere him, respect him, support him, esteem and emulate him, and $show high regard for that monk. 
$Again, Vassakāra, a monk is contented, taking robes [just] to cover the $body, taking food [just] to sustain the physical body. 
Wherever he goes, he $takes his robes and bowl with him, without concerns or longings, like a $wild goose that flies through the air with [just] its two wings.132 In these $ways a monk is contented, taking robes [just] to cover the body, taking food $[just] to sustain the physical body. 
Wherever he goes, he takes his robes $and bowl with him, without concerns or longings. 
Vassakāra, if we see in $a monk such superior contentment, then we all revere him, respect him, $support him, esteem and emulate him, and show high regard for that monk. 
$Again, Vassakāra, a monk continuously practices mindfulness, is accom￾plished in right mindfulness, always remembering, not forgetting, what $was done long ago and what was heard long ago. 
Vassakāra, if we see in $a monk such superior possession of right mindfulness, then we all revere $him, respect him, support him, esteem and emulate him, and show high $regard for that monk. 
$Again, Vassakāra, a monk constantly and energetically practices to abandon $evil and unwholesome [states] and to develop wholesome states, persistently $arousing his mind, single-mindedly and steadfastly, for the sake of [devel￾oping] the roots of wholesomeness with relentless energy. 
Vassakāra, if we $see in a monk such superior diligence, then we all revere him, respect him, $support him, esteem and emulate him, and show high regard for that monk. 
$Again, Vassakāra, a monk cultivates comprehension and wisdom. 
$Observing the rise and fall of phenomena, he attains such comprehension, $noble penetrative knowledge, and discriminative understanding as will $truly put an end to dukkha. 
Vassakāra, if we see in a monk such superior $wisdom, then we all revere him, respect him, support him, esteem and $emulate him, and show high regard for that monk. 
$146$Division 12$Again, Vassakāra, a monk has eradicated all taints and attained the $taintless liberation of the mind and liberation by wisdom. 
He dwells having $known by himself, having awakened by himself, having realized by him￾self: “Birth has been ended, the holy life has been established, what had $to be done has been done, there will not be another experiencing of exis￾tence,” knowing this as it really is. 
Vassakāra, if we see in a monk the $eradication of the taints, then we all revere, respect, support, esteem and $emulate, and show high regard for that monk. 
$Vassakāra, the World-honored One who knows and sees, the Tathāgata, $free from attachment, fully awakened, taught us these ten principles of $respect. 
Vassakāra, if we see a monk practicing these ten principles, then $we all revere, respect, support, esteem and emulate, and show high regard $for that monk. 
$At this, the great assembly [of Vassakāra’s retainers] exclaimed loudly: $The straight path is to be developed, it is not to be left undeveloped! If some￾one develops the straight path, which is not to be left undeveloped, then they $are following the arahants of the world who are revered, respected, supported, $and highly regarded. 
Because you venerable ones are able to develop the $straight path, which can be developed, therefore you are revered in the world $as arahants, respected, supported, and highly regarded.133$Then Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, and his retainers asked, $“Ānanda, where are you dwelling now?” $Venerable Ānanda replied, “I am now dwelling here at Rājagaha, in the $Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.” $[Vassakāra said]: $Ānanda, the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary, is delightful, well $maintained, and pleasing.134 It is free of noise during the day and quiet at $night, free of mosquitos and gadflies, and also free of flies and fleas; it is $neither [too] cold nor [too] hot. 
Ānanda, do you delight in the Bamboo $Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary? $Venerable Ānanda replied: $It is like this, Vassakāra; it is like this, Vassakāra. 
The Bamboo Grove, $147^taisho655b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$the Squirrels’ Sanctuary, is delightful, well maintained, and pleasing. 
It $is free of noise during the day and quiet at night, free of mosquitos and $gadflies, and also free of flies and fleas; it is neither [too] cold nor [too] $hot. 
Vassakāra, I delight in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. 
$Why is that? Because the World-honored One commended it.135$At that time the great general Upananda was among that gathering. 
Great $General Upananda said: $It is like this, Vassakāra; it is like this, Vassakāra. 
The Bamboo Grove, $the Squirrels’ Sanctuary is delightful, well maintained, and pleasing. 
It is $free of noise during the day and quiet at night, free of mosquitos and gad-$flies, and also free of flies and fleas; it is neither [too] cold nor [too] hot. 
$The venerable one delights in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. 
$Why is that? Because this venerable one practices application of the mind, $delights in application of the mind.136$Hearing this, Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, said: $Great General Upananda, in former times the renunciant Gotama was stay￾ing in the pleasure park of Kimbilā.$137 Great General Upananda, at that $time I frequently went there to visit the renunciant Gotama. 
Why is that? $[Because] the renunciant Gotama practiced application of the mind, $delighted in application of the mind. 
He praised all application of the mind. 
$Hearing this, Venerable Ānanda said: $Vassakāra, do not say, “The renunciant Gotama praised all application of $the mind.” Why is that? [Because] the World-honored One praised some $[kinds of] application of the mind but did not praise other [kinds of] appli￾cation of the mind.138$Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, asked further, “Ānanda, as to $the application of the mind that the renunciant Gotama did not praise, what $type of application of the mind did he not praise?” $Venerable Ānanda replied: $Vassakāra, suppose that someone is entangled in sensual desire and does $not really know how to get out of that arisen sensual desire. 
Because of $148$Division 12$being obstructed by sensual desire, they apply their mind, increasingly $apply their mind, repeatedly apply their mind. 
Vassakāra, this is the first 655c$[kind of] application of the mind that the World-honored One did not praise. 
$Again, Vassakāra, suppose that someone is entangled in ill will and $does not really know how to get out of that arisen ill will. 
Because of $being obstructed by ill will, they apply their mind, increasingly apply $their mind, repeatedly apply their mind. 
Vassakāra, this is the second [kind $of] application of the mind that the World-honored One did not praise. 
$Again, Vassakāra, suppose that someone is entangled in sloth-and￾torpor and does not really know how to get out of that arisen sloth-and￾torpor. 
Because of being obstructed by sloth-and-torpor, they apply their $mind, increasingly apply their mind, repeatedly apply their mind. 
Vassakāra, $this is the third [kind of] application of the mind that the World-honored $One did not praise. 
$[Again, Vassakāra, suppose that someone is entangled in restlessness￾and-worry and does not really know how to get out of that arisen restless￾ness-and-worry. 
Because of being obstructed by restlessness-and-worry, $they apply their mind, increasingly apply their mind, repeatedly apply $their mind. 
Vassakāra, this is the fourth kind of application of the mind $that the World-honored One did not praise.]139$Again, Vassakāra, suppose that someone is entangled in doubt and does $not really know how to get out of that arisen doubt. 
Because of being $obstructed by doubt, they apply their mind, increasingly apply their mind, $repeatedly apply their mind. 
Vassakāra, this is the <fifth>140 [kind of] $application of the mind that the World-honored One did not praise. 
Vas￾sakāra, the World-honored One did not praise these five kinds of] appli￾cation of the mind. 
$Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, said: $Ānanda, these <five> [kinds of] application of the mind are dislikable,141$they are occasions for abhorrence. 
The renunciant Gotama did not praise $them. 
Why is that? Because he was perfectly and completely awakened. 
$Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, asked further, “Ānanda, what $[kind of] application of the mind did the renunciant Gotama praise?” $Venerable Ānanda replied: $149$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$150$Vassakāra, secluded from sensual desires, secluded from evil and unwhole￾some states ...
up to ...
a monk dwells having attained the fourth absorp￾tion. 
Vassakāra, the World-honored One praised these four applications $of the mind. 
$Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, said: $Ānanda, these four [kinds of] application of the mind are praiseworthy; $they are occasions for praise. 
The renunciant Gotama praised them. 
Why $is that? Because he was perfectly and completely awakened. 
Ānanda, I $have numerous matters to attend to. 
I ask leave to return. 
$Venerable Ānanda said, “[If] you wish to return, do as you wish.” $Then Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, having heard what Ven￾erable Ānanda had said, received it well and kept it well in mind. 
He rose $from his seat, circumambulated Venerable Ānanda three times, and left. 
$Then, soon after Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, had left, the $brahmin Gopaka Moggallāna said, “Ānanda, [I assume] you will not be $answering at all the question I asked [earlier].” $Venerable Ānanda said, “That is so, Moggallāna. 
I will not be answering $it [since I answered the same question asked by Vassakāra].”142$The brahmin Gopaka Moggallāna said, “Ānanda, I have another question. 
$Will you listen to my question?” $Venerable Ānanda replied, “Moggallāna, you may ask. 
On hearing it, I $will consider it.” $The brahmin Gopaka Moggallāna asked: $Ānanda, what is the difference between the liberation of the Tathāgata, free $from attachment, fully awakened, and the liberation of an arahant who is $liberated by wisdom? Which of these two liberations is superior?143$Venerable Ānanda replied: $Moggallāna, there is no difference between the liberation of the Tathāgata, $free from attachment, fully awakened, and the liberation of an arahant $who is liberated by wisdom. 
Neither of these two liberations is superior. 
$The brahmin Gopaka Moggallāna said, “Ānanda, please take your meal $here!” Venerable Ānanda accepted by remaining silent. 
^taisho656a Division 12$Knowing that [Ānanda] had accepted by remaining silent, the brahmin $Gopaka Moggallāna rose from his seat and personally brought water for wash￾ing [of hands], and personally offered various kinds of fine dishes, delicious, $plentiful, and easy to digest, making sure that [Ānanda] was satisfied. 
After $the meal, he gathered up the utensils, again brought water for washing, and $then seated himself on a small seat to one side to listen to the Dharma. 
Ven￾erable Ānanda expounded the Dharma to him, exhorting and inspiring him, $fully delighting him by teaching him the Dharma with countless skillful means. 
$Thus said Venerable Ānanda. 
Having been exhorted, inspired, and fully $delighted, Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, his retainers, and the $brahmin Gopaka Moggallāna were delighted on having heard what Venerable $Ānanda had said and received it respectfully. 
$146. 
^ck The Discourse on the Simile $of the Elephant’s Footprint144$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the heterodox practitioner Pilotika had gone out of Sāvatthī$at dawn and approached the Buddha.145 He paid homage by bowing his head, $stepped back, and sat to one side. 
The Buddha expounded the Dharma to $him, exhorting and inspiring him, fully delighting him by teaching him the $Dharma with countless skillful means. 
Having exhorted and inspired him, $fully delighting him, he remained silent. 
The heterodox practitioner Pilotika, $having been taught the Dharma by the Buddha, having been exhorted, encour￾aged, and delighted, rose from his seat, paid homage by bowing his head to $the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and left. 
$At that time the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi, driving a very beautiful white chariot $and in the company of five hundred disciples, had gone out of Sāvatthī at $dawn and was approaching a forest area with the wish of instructing his dis￾ciples in recitation of the sacred texts.146 The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi saw the het￾erodox practitioner Pilotika coming in the distance. 
He asked him, “Vacchā -$yana, having risen so early, where are you coming from?” $The heterodox practitioner Pilotika replied, “Brahmin, I come from visiting $the World-honored One, having paid my respects and offered my support.” $151$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$152$The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi asked, “Vacchāyana, do you know about the knowl￾edge and wisdom learned by the renunciant Gotama in empty and quiet $places?” $The heterodox practitioner Pilotika replied: $Brahmin, what kind of person could know about the knowledge and wisdom $learned by the World-honored One in empty and quiet places? Brahmin, to $know about the knowledge and wisdom learned by the World-honored One $in empty and quiet places, one would [have to] be like him. 
However, brahmin, $there are four principles of reason in the sacred texts that we recite.147 On $the basis of these four principles of reason I have firm confidence that the $World-honored One is a tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened; $that the Dharma is well taught by the World-honored One; and that the noble $Sangha of the disciples of the Tathāgata progresses rightly. 
$Brahmin, it is just as a skilled elephant trainer might, while walking $in a forest area, see among the trees of the forest a large elephant footprint $and, on seeing it, have firm confidence that this footprint belongs to a very $big [male] elephant. 
Brahmin, for me it is the same. 
There are four prin￾ciples of reason in the sacred texts that we recite. 
On the basis of these $four principles of reason I have firm confidence that the World-honored $One is a tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened; that the Dharma $is well taught by the World-honored One; and that the noble Sangha of $the Tathāgata’s disciples progresses rightly. 
$What are the four principles of reason? Brahmin, there are learned and $wise members of the warrior caste, debaters who have wide learning and $determination, who are able to defeat people [in debate], know-it-alls who $compose treatises on their various views and promote them among the $populace. 
They think, “We will approach the renunciant Gotama and ask $him about such-and-such a matter. 
If he is able to reply, we will keep on $questioning him further. 
If he is unable to reply, he will be defeated and $we will give up and leave.” Hearing that the World-honored One is $dwelling in a certain village or town, they approach him. 
[However,] on $seeing the World-honored One, they do not even dare to question him, let $alone have the ability to defeat him.148$In this way, brahmin, using the first principle of reason from the texts $that we recite, on the basis of this reason, I have firm confidence that the ^taisho656b Division 12$World-honored One is a tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened; $that the Dharma is well taught by the World-honored One; and that the $noble Sangha of the Tathāgata’s disciples progresses rightly.149$In the same way, brahmin, there are learned and wise brahmins ...
$learned and wise householders ...
learned and wise renunciants, debaters $who have wide learning and determination, who are able to defeat ordinary $people [in debate], know-it-alls who compose treatises on their various $views and promote them among the populace. 
They think, “We will approach $the renunciant Gotama and ask him about such-and-such a matter. 
If he is $able to reply, we will keep on questioning him further. 
If he is unable to $reply, he will be defeated and we will leave.” Hearing that the World-honored $One is dwelling in a certain village or town, they approach him. 
[However,] $on seeing the World-honored One, they do not even dare to question him, $let alone have the ability to defeat him. 
$In this way, brahmin, using the fourth principle of reason from the texts $that we recite, on the basis of this reason, I have firm confidence that the $World-honored One is a tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened; $that the Dharma is well taught by the World-honored One; and that the $noble Sangha of the Tathāgata’s disciples progresses rightly. 
$In this way, brahmin, there are these four principles of reason in the $sacred texts that we recite. 
On the basis of these four principles of reason, $I have firm confidence that the World-honored One is a tathāgata, free $from attachment, fully awakened; that the Dharma is well taught by the $World-honored One; and that the noble Sangha of the Tathāgata’s disciples $progresses rightly. 
$The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi said: $Vacchāyana, you greatly support the renunciant Gotama. 
With cause 656c and with reason you are delighted and have respectfully received [his $teachings].” $The heterodox practitioner Pilotika replied: $It is like this, brahmin; it is like this. 
I support that World-honored One $to the utmost and praise him to the utmost. 
The entire world should also $support him. 
$153$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi, having heard these reasons, descended from $his chariot, knelt with his right knee on the ground, extended his hands with $joined palms in the direction of Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park, and paid $homage three times: “Homage to the Tathāgata, free from attachment, fully $awakened!” Having done this three times, he returned to mount his very $beautiful white chariot and approached Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$Having reached that destination, he descended from the chariot and approached $the Buddha on foot. 
He exchanged polite greetings, stepped back, and sat to $one side. 
$The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi told the Buddha the entire conversation he had $had with the heterodox practitioner Pilotika. 
Having heard it, the World-hon￾ored One said: $Brahmin, the simile of the elephant’s footprint spoken by the heterodox $practitioner Pilotika is not well composed and not complete. 
I will now $tell you the simile of the elephant’s footprint that is well composed and $complete. 
Listen carefully! $Brahmin, it is just as a skilled elephant trainer might, while walking $in a forest area, see among the trees of the forest a large elephant footprint. 
$On seeing it, he should have confidence that this footprint belongs to a $very big [male] elephant. 
[But,] brahmin, that skilled elephant trainer may $lack such confidence, [thinking,] “In this forest there are also female ele￾phants called kaṇerukā whose bodies are very large. 
They [too] leave $such a footprint.” $Then he searches for [more] such footprints and again sees a large ele￾phant footprint. 
On seeing it, he should have confidence that this footprint $belongs to a very big [male] elephant. 
[But,] brahmin, that skilled elephant $trainer may still lack such confidence, [thinking,] “In this forest there are $also female elephants called kāḷārikā whose bodies are very large. 
They $[too] leave such a footprint.” $Then he searches for [more] such footprints and again sees a large ele￾phant footprint. 
On seeing it, he should have confidence that this footprint $belongs to a very big [male] elephant. 
[But,] brahmin, that skilled elephant $trainer may still lack such confidence, [thinking,] “In this forest there are $also female elephants called vāmanikā whose bodies are very large. 
They $[too] leave such a footprint.” $154$Division 12$Then he searches for [more] such footprints and again sees a large ele￾phant footprint. 
On seeing it, he has firm confidence that this footprint $belongs to a very big [male] elephant. 
Having searched for footprints and $seen large elephant footprints, [he thinks,] “Only a big [male] elephant $has a footprint so very long and broad, with its entire circumference clearly $marked, squarely and deeply impressed in the ground.” $Also, he sees the elephant [itself], coming and going, standing still and $walking, standing upright and lying down. 
Having seen that elephant [itself], $he thinks, “If there is such a footprint, it must be [of this] big elephant.” $In the same way, brahmin, there appears in the world a tathāgata, free $from attachment, fully awakened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, $a well-gone one, knower of the world, unsurpassable person, leader on $the path of Dharma, teacher of devas and human beings, called a buddha, $an exalted one. 
In this world with its devas and māras, Brahmās, renun￾ciants, and brahmins ...
up to ...
devas and human beings he dwells $having known by himself, having awakened by himself, having realized 657a by himself. 
He knows as it really is: “Birth has been ended, the holy life $has been established, what had to be done has been done, there will not $be another experiencing of existence.” $He teaches the Dharma, which is excellent in the beginning, excellent $in the middle, and excellent in the end, with its meaning and phrasing, $endowed with purity, and he reveals the holy life. 
Having heard him teach $the Dharma, a householder or a householder’s son gains confidence. 
$Having gained confidence in the true Dharma and discipline of the Tathā-$gata, he reflects, “The household life is confined, a dusty place; going $forth to train in the path is [like] emerging into a vast open space. 
Now $for me at home, fettered with [such] fetters, it is not possible to devote $my life completely to the practice of the holy life in purity. 
Let me forsake $my wealth, little or much, forsake my relatives, few or many, shave off $beard and hair, don the yellow robe and, out of faith, leave the home life $and become homeless to train in the path.” $At a later time he forsakes his wealth, little or much, forsakes his rela￾tives, few or many, shaves off beard and hair, dons the yellow robe and, $out of faith, leaves the home life and becomes homeless to train in the path. 
$Having gone forth to train in the path, having forsaken the characteristics $155$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$of family life, he receives the training of monkhood.

He does not create factions, $does not delight in factions or praise factions.

$He abstains from harsh speech, having abandoned harsh speech. 
What￾ever speech there is that is rough and rude in tone, that sounds offensive $and grates on the ear, that people neither enjoy nor desire, that causes $others suffering and vexation, and that does not lead to calmness—such $speech he has abandoned. 
Whatever speech there is that is pure, peaceful, $156^taisho657b Division 12$and gentle, that is pleasant to the ear and [easily] enters the mind, that is $enjoyable and desirable, that gives others happiness, speech endowed $with meaning, that does not make others afraid and that leads to calmness $in others—such speech he speaks. 
He purifies his mind with regard to $harsh speech. 
$He abstains from frivolous speech, having abandoned frivolous speech.

$Staying in a forest, or having gone to the base of a tree in an empty $peaceful place, he spreads out his sitting mat and sits down cross-legged $with body erect. 
With right mental aspiration and undivided mindfulness, $he abandons and removes covetousness. 
With the mind free of agitation $on seeing others’ wealth and requisites of life, he does not give rise to $covetousness by wishing, “May I get it!” He purifies his mind with regard $to covetousness. 
$In the same way he abandons ill will ...

Will you listen $if I venture to express it?” $The World-honored One said, “Brahmin, feel free to ask.” $The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi then asked: $Among the disciples of the renunciant Gotama there are those who live $at home and those who have gone forth to train in the path. 
For what pur￾pose do they recite and practice what they have widely heard [of the $Dharma]? $The World-honored One replied: $Brahmin, my disciples, who live at home or who have gone forth to train $in the path, recite and practice what they have widely heard because they $wish to tame themselves, they wish to calm themselves, they seek final $extinction for themselves. 
Brahmin, for these reasons my disciples, who $live at home or who have gone forth to train in the path, recite and practice $what they have widely heard. 
$The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi asked further, “Gotama, is it a distinction to recite $and practice what one has widely heard? Is it a virtue to recite and practice $what one has widely heard?” $The World-honored One replied, “Brahmin, it is a distinction to recite $and practice what one has widely heard.

The moon-palace also decreases, its brightness also decreases, $its shape also decreases day by day [until] it is gone. 
Brahmin, there comes $a time when the moon has reached extinction and is not visible anymore. 
$Brahmin, persons who have a bad friend, gain such faith in the Tathā-$gata’s true Dharma and discipline.

Brahmin, there comes a time when, $being instructed by this bad friend, their wholesome states entirely cease $to exist, just like the disappearance of the [waning] moon. 
Brahmin, this $is how one should look upon a bad friend as similar to the [waning] moon. 
$The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi asked further, “Gotama, how should one look 660b upon a good friend?” $The World-honored One replied, “Brahmin, one should look upon a good $friend as similar to the [waxing] moon.” $The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi asked further, “Gotama, how should one look $upon a good friend as similar to the [waxing] moon?” $The World-honored One replied: $Brahmin, a good friend is just like the [waxing] moon, whose brightness $is at first weak but increases day by day.

$In the same way, brahmin, persons who have a good friend gain faith $in the Tathāgata’s true Dharma and discipline. 
Having gained faith, at a $later time they have devotion and respect. 
Their practice is appropriate. 
$They establish right comprehension and they progress in the Dharma in $accordance with the Dharma. 
They increase their faith, and they also $increase their keeping of the precepts, their wide learning, their generosity, $171$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$and their wisdom. 
Brahmin, there comes a time when, being endowed $with a good friend, their wholesome states come to completion, just like $the moon on the fifteenth day. 
Brahmin, this is how one should look upon $a good friend as similar to the moon. 
$Then the World-honored One said these verses:156$It is just as the stainless moon, $Moving through empty space, $Which outshines all constellations in the world $With its bright radiance. 
$In the same way [those who have] faith and wide learning, $And generosity free from stinginess and greed $Outshine all stinginess in the world $With the bright radiance of their giving. 
$They are like a great nāga$Which raises clouds, thunder, and lightning, $And pours down rain abundantly $So that the whole earth is drenched. 
$In the same way, [those who have] faith, wide learning, $And generosity free of stinginess and greed $Give food and drink plentifully $And delight in urging [others] to increase their giving. 
$In this way, like the strongest thunder $When the devas send down timely rain, $Such is the wide and heavy rain of merit $That is rained down by this donor.

^ck The Discourse to Esukārī160$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha, in the $Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. 
$At that time the brahmin Esukārī, while roaming around in the afternoon, $approached the Buddha. 
Having exchanged friendly greetings, he stepped $back, sat to one side, and said, “Gotama, I have a question that I would like $to ask. 
Will you listen if I venture to express it?” $The World-honored One said, “Brahmin, feel free to ask.” $Then the brahmin Esukārī asked: $Gotama, the brahmins declare four types of service for the four castes. 
$They declare service for brahmins, and they declare service for warriors, $merchants, and workers. 
Gotama, the brahmins declare [these types of] $service for brahmins: a brahmin should serve a brahmin; a warrior, a ^taisho661a Division 12$merchant, and a worker should serve a brahmin. 
Gotama, these four castes $should serve a brahmin. 
$Gotama, the brahmins declare [these types of] service for warriors: a $warrior should serve a warrior; a merchant and a worker should serve a $warrior. 
Gotama, these three castes should serve a warrior. 
$Gotama, the brahmins declare [these types of] service for merchants: $a merchant should serve a merchant and a worker should serve a merchant. 
$Gotama, these two castes should serve a merchant. 
$Gotama, the brahmins declare [this type of] service for workers: a $worker should serve a worker. 
Who else is so low that they should be $declared to serve a worker? Only a worker serves a worker. 
$The World-honored One asked: $Brahmin, do the brahmins themselves know what four types of service $to declare for the four castes, so that they declare service for brahmins $and declare service for warriors, merchants, and workers?161$The brahmin Esukārī replied: $They do not know, Gotama; but the brahmins themselves make this state￾ment, “In this world with its devas and māras, Brahmās, renunciants, $brahmins, from human beings to devas, we brahmins, [although] not $knowing ourselves what four types of service to declare for the four castes, $[nevertheless] declare service for brahmins, and declare service for warriors, $merchants, and workers.” $The World-honored One said: $Brahmin, it is just as if a person were to force a piece of meat on another $saying, “Good man, eat this and pay me the <price> of it!”162 Brahmin, $what you say on behalf of the brahmins is just like that. 
Why is that? The $brahmins themselves do not know what four types of service to declare $for the four castes, [yet] they declare service for brahmins and they declare $service for warriors, merchants, and workers. 
$The World-honored One asked: $Brahmin, how should one do service? If there is service [to be done], and 661b$175$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$if because of that service one remains the same and does not become $better, should one do such service?

If I serve $[someone] and if because of that service I become better and do not remain $the same, then I should serve them. 
$Gotama, if I serve a brahmin and if because of that service I remain $the same and do not become better, then I should not serve them.

For $seven generations on both his father’s and mother’s sides there has been $uninterrupted continuity of births without blemish.

$Will you listen to my question?” $The World-honored One said, “Young brahmin, you can feel free to ask.” $Then the young brahmin Assalāyana asked, saying: $Gotama, the brahmins speak like this, “The brahmin caste is the highest; $the others are not equal to it. 
The brahmin caste is white; all of the others $are black. 
The brahmins achieve purity; nonbrahmins do not achieve $purity. 
Brahmins are children of Brahmā, born from his mouth. 
The brah￾mins were created by Brahmā.” I do not know what the renunciant Gotama $will say about this. 
$The World-honored One said: $I will now ask you something. 
Answer according to your understanding.176$Young brahmin, have you heard that in the countries of Yona and Kamboja $there are two castes, masters and slaves, and that the masters [can] become $slaves and the slaves [can] become masters? $The young brahmin Assalāyana replied: $Gotama, I have heard that in the countries of Yona and Kamboja there $are two castes, masters and slaves, and that the masters [can] become $slaves and the slaves [can] become masters.

$The World-honored One said:183$Young brahmin, in the distant past there were many seers who were staying $together in a high forest area and who had given rise to this evil view, $“The brahmin caste is the highest; the others are not equal to it. 
The brah￾min caste is white; all of the others are black. 
The brahmins achieve purity; $nonbrahmins do not achieve purity. 
Brahmins are children of Brahmā, $born from his mouth. 
The brahmins were created by Brahmā.” 665c$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Then the seer Asita Devala heard that the many seers who were staying $together in that high forest area had given rise to this evil view. 
He put $on yellow robes and wrapped a yellow cloth around his head; then, sup￾porting himself with a stick, holding an umbrella, and wearing the sandals $of a white-clothed [lay person],184 he entered without using the gate, went $to the seers’ retreat, and walked up and down.185$Then one of the seers who was dwelling there in the high forest area $saw the seer Asita Devala who, having put on yellow robes and wrapped $a yellow cloth around his head, supporting himself with a stick, holding $an umbrella, and wearing the sandals of a white-clothed [layperson], had $entered without using the gate, gone to the seers’ retreat, and was walking $up and down. 
Having seen this, he approached the many seers who were $dwelling together in the high forest area and said, “Friends, right now $there is a person who, having put on yellow robes and wrapped a yellow $cloth around his head, supporting himself with a stick, holding an umbrella, $and wearing the sandals of a white-clothed [layperson], has entered without $using the gate and gone to the seers’ retreat, and is walking up and down. 
$Shall we together curse him [saying], ‘You, become ashes! You, become $ashes!’?” $Then the many seers who were dwelling together in the high forest area $approached the seer Asita Devala. 
On reaching him, they together cursed $him [saying], “You, become ashes! You, become ashes!” They cursed him $according to their procedure for cursing [saying], “You, become ashes! $You, become ashes!” [However,] the more they cursed him, the more his $complexion became bright and beautiful and his body pleasantly bright. 
$Then the many seers thought, “Previously when we cursed someone $[saying], ‘You, become ashes! You, become ashes!’ he became ashes. 
$Now we are cursing this person [saying], ‘You, become ashes! You, become $ashes!’ but the more we curse this person according to our procedure for $cursing, the more his complexion becomes bright and beautiful and his $body pleasantly bright. 
Let us rather ask him [who he is].”186 So they $asked him, “Who are you?” $The seer Asita Devala replied, “Friends, have you heard of the seer $Asita Devala?” They replied, “We have heard of the seer Asita Devala.” $He said again, “I am he.” Then the many seers together apologized to the $196$Division 12$seer Asita Devala, “Please forgive us! We did not know that the venerable $one was the seer Asita Devala.” $Then the seer Asita Devala said to the seers, “I have already forgiven $you. 
Is it true that you have given rise to this evil view, ‘The brahmin $caste is the highest; the others are not equal to it. 
The brahmin caste is $white; all the others are black. 
The brahmins achieve purity; nonbrahmins 666a do not achieve purity. 
Brahmins are children of Brahmā, born from his $mouth. 
The brahmins were created by Brahmā’?” The seers replied, “Yes, $that is so.” $Asita again asked the seers, “Do you yourself know your own father?” $The seers replied, “We know him. 
He was a brahmin who took a brahmin $wife, not a nonbrahmin; and that father’s father, and so on up to seven $generations of fathers, were brahmins [each of whom] took a brahmin $wife, not a nonbrahmin.”187$Asita asked the seers further, “Do you yourself know your own mother?” $The seers replied, “We know her. 
She was a brahmin who took a brahmin $husband, not a nonbrahmin; and that mother’s mother, and so on up to $seven generations of mothers, were brahmins [each of whom] took a brah￾min husband, not a nonbrahmin.” $Asita asked the seers further, “Do you yourself know how the reception $of an embryo takes place?” The seers answered, “We know. 
Due to the $conjunction of three things the reception of an embryo takes place: there $is a coming together of the father and mother, the [mother’s womb] is $vacant and capable, and the gandhabba has arrived. 
Asita, on these things $coming together there is reception of the fetus by the mother.” $Asita asked the seers further, “Do you know if the one to be born is $male or female? Do you know where it came from? Did it come from a $warrior clan, a brahmin, a merchant, or a worker clan? Did it come from $the east, south, west, or north?”188 The seers replied, “We do not know.” $Asita also said to the seers, “Friends, you do not see and do not know $these things, you do not know whether there has been reception of an $embryo, who it is and from where it came, whether it is male or female, $whether it came from a warrior clan, a brahmin, a merchant or a worker $clan, and whether it came from the east, south, west, or north. 
Yet you $make this statement: ‘The brahmin caste is the highest; the others are not $197$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$equal to it. 
The brahmin caste is white; all of the others are black. 
The $brahmins achieve purity; nonbrahmins do not achieve purity. 
Brahmins $are children of Brahmā, born from his mouth. 
The brahmins were created $by Brahmā.’” $Young brahmin, those many seers staying in a high forest area, on $being thus well instructed and well rebuked by the seer Asita Devala, $were unable to declare the purity of brahmins—let alone of your teachers $and their followers, who dressed in hides and straw.189$Then the young brahmin Assalāyana, being rebuked to his face by the $World-honored One, was sad and distressed within. 
He lowered his head in $silence, unable to reply. 
$Then the World-honored One, having rebuked the young brahmin $Assalāyana to his face, in order to cheer him up, said: $Young brahmin, [suppose] a brahmin performs a sacrifice and makes an $offering, and he has four sons, of whom two are fond of learning and two $are not learned. 
Young brahmin, what do you think? To whom will that $brahmin first offer the best seat, the best water for washing, and the best $food?190$The young brahmin Assalāyana replied: $Gotama, if that brahmin has two sons who are fond of learning, he will $certainly first offer them the best seat, the best water for washing, and the $best food. 
$The World-honored One asked further: $Again, young brahmin, suppose a brahmin performs a sacrifice and makes $an offering, and he has four sons, of whom two are fond of learning but $are not energetic and delight in doing evil things, and two are not learned $but are fond of being energetic and delight in doing good things. 
Young $brahmin, what do you think? To whom will that brahmin first offer the $best seats, the best water for washing, and the best food? $The young brahmin Assalāyana replied: $Gotama, if that brahmin has two sons who, although not learned, are fond $198^taisho666b Division 12$of being energetic and delight in doing good things, he will certainly first $offer them the best seats, the best water for washing, and the best food. 
$The World-honored One said: $Young brahmin, you first commended learning, and then commended the $upholding of morality. 
Young brahmin, I say that all four castes are able $to achieve purity; I declare it and proclaim it. 
You too are [now] saying $that all four castes are able to achieve purity; you are declaring it and pro￾claiming it. 
$At this the young brahmin Assalāyana got up from his seat, wishing to $pay homage by bowing his head to the Buddha’s feet.191 Then that big assem￾bly made a huge uproar: $The renunciant Gotama is very wonderful, very remarkable! He has great $spiritual power, great virtue, great merit, great power! Why is that? $[Because] as the renunciant Gotama says that all of the four castes are $able to achieve purity, as he declares it and proclaims it, he causes the $young brahmin Assalāyana also to say that all of the four castes are able $to achieve purity. 
$Then the World-honored One, knowing the thoughts in the minds of the $big assembly, said: $Stop, stop, Assalāyana! Although your mind is pleased and satisfied [mak￾ing you wish to pay homage], you may return to your seat. 
I will teach $you the Dharma. 
$Then the young brahmin Assalāyana, having paid homage by bowing his $head to the Buddha’s feet, stepped back and sat to one side. 
The World-hon￾ored One taught him the Dharma, exhorting and inspiring him, fully delighting $him, teaching him the Dharma with countless skillful means. 
Having exhorted $and inspired him, fully delighting him, he remained silent. 
$Then the young brahmin Assalāyana, having been taught the Dharma by $the Buddha, having been exhorted and inspired, fully delighted, rose from $his seat, paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated $him three times, and left. 
$199$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Then the many Kosalan brahmins, before they had gone far, rebuked $Assalāyana with all sorts of talk: $What did you want to do? You wanted to defeat the renunciant Gotama, $but instead you return having been defeated by the renunciant Gotama. 
$You are just like someone who goes into the forest [in search of a cure] $for their eyes,192 but instead returns having lost their sight. 
Assalāyana, $you too are like that. 
You wanted to defeat the renunciant Gotama, but $instead you return having been defeated by the renunciant Gotama. 
You $are just like someone who goes into a pool to drink, but instead returns $still thirsty. 
Assalāyana, you too are like that. 
You wanted to defeat the $renunciant Gotama, but instead you return having been defeated by the $renunciant Gotama. 
Assalāyana, what did you want to do? $Then the young brahmin Assalāyana said to the many Kosalan brahmins: $Friends, earlier I had already said, “The renunciant Gotama teaches the $Dharma in accordance with the Dharma. 
If someone teaches the Dharma $in accordance with the Dharma, it is not possible to defeat him in debate.” $Thus said the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the young $brahmin Assalāyana was delighted and received it respectfully. 
$152. 
^ck The Discourse to Suka193$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha, in the $Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. 
$At that time the young brahmin Suka,194 the son of Todeyya, had gone to $Rājagaha for some small matter and was staying in the home of a householder. 
$Then the young brahmin Suka, the son of Todeyya, asked the householder $with whom he was staying: $Is there some renunciant or brahmin who is the leader and teacher of a $congregation, head of a great congregation, respected by the people, whom $I could go to visit to pay my respects at an appropriate time, such that $when I pay my respects to him it will bring me delight? $The householder replied: $200^taisho666c 667a$Division 12$There is, Beloved of the Devas. 
The renunciant Gotama of the Sakya lin￾eage left the Sakya clan, shaved off his hair and beard, donned the yellow $robes, and out of faith left the household life and became homeless to $train in the path. 
He has awakened to the unsurpassable, right, and total $awakening. 
Beloved of the Devas, you can go to visit him yourself at an $appropriate time, call on him, and pay your respects to him. 
Perhaps when $you pay your respects to him, your mind will experience delight. 
$The young brahmin Suka asked further, “Where is the renunciant Gotama? $I wish to visit him.” $The householder replied, “The renunciant Gotama is staying at Rājagaha, $in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. 
Go there and visit him.” $Then the young brahmin Suka went out of the householder’s home where $he was staying and approached the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. 
$From afar the young brahmin Suka saw the World-honored One in the grove, $dignified and beautiful, like the moon amid the stars, with a radiant aura, $shining like a golden mountain, endowed with handsome appearance and $lofty dignity, with calm sense faculties, free of obstruction, accomplished $and disciplined, and with his mind calm and quiet.195$On seeing the Buddha, he went forward and approached him. 
Having $exchanged polite greetings, he stepped back, sat to one side, and said, $“Gotama, I have a question I would like to ask. 
Will you listen if I venture $to express it?” $The World-honored One said, “Feel free to ask.” $The young brahmin Suka asked: $Gotama, according to what I have heard, one who lives at home will gain $proper understanding and knowledge in accordance with the Dharma; one $who goes forth to train in the path will not. 
I ask Gotama about this matter. 
$The World-honored One replied, “This matter is uncertain.” $The young brahmin Suka said, “Gotama, may you now analyze this matter $for me?” $The World-honored One said, “Young brahmin, listen closely and pay $proper attention, and I shall give you an analytical explanation.”196 The young $brahmin Suka listened to receive the instruction. 
$201$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$The Buddha said: $Young brahmin, if one who lives at home or one who has gone forth to $train in the path practices wrongly, I do not commend them. 
Why is that? $If one who lives at home or one who has gone forth to train in the path $practices wrongly, they will not gain proper understanding and will not $come to know in accordance with the Dharma. 
That is why, young brahmin, $if one who lives at home or one who has gone forth to train in the path $practices wrongly, I do not commend them. 
$Young brahmin, if one who lives at home or one who has gone forth $to train in the path practices rightly, I commend them. 
Why is that? Because $if one who lives at home or one who has gone forth to train in the path $practices rightly, they will certainly gain proper understanding and will $come to know in accordance with the Dharma. 
That is why, young brahmin, $if one who lives at home or one who has gone forth to train in the path $practices rightly, I commend them. 
$Young brahmin, this is how I speak. 
In speaking of these two states, I $have analyzed them like this, and proclaimed them like this. 
[In contrast,] $if a renunciant or brahmin is firmly entrenched in upholding a one-sided $position, they will say, “This is true; anything else is false.”197$The young brahmin Suka said: $Gotama, according to what I have heard, living at home is of much profit, $much virtue; going forth to train in the path is not. 
May I ask Gotama $about this matter? $The World-honored One replied, “This matter is uncertain.” $The young brahmin Suka said, “Gotama, may you again analyze this $matter for me?” $The World-honored One said, “Young brahmin, listen closely and pay $proper attention, and I shall give you an analytical explanation.” The young $brahmin Suka listened to receive the instruction. 
$The Buddha said: $Young brahmin, for one who lives at home there is much adversity, much $conflict, much that is unpleasant, and one who practices wrongly will not $202^taisho667b Division 12$gain much fruit, will not have much merit. 
It is just as in farming, where $there is much adversity, much conflict, much that is unpleasant, and one who $practices wrongly will not gain much fruit, will not have much merit. 
It is $like that, young brahmin; if one lives at home it is also like that. 
$Young brahmin, for one who has gone forth to train in the path, there is $little adversity, little conflict, little that is unpleasant, and one who practices $wrongly will not gain much fruit, not have much merit. 
It is just as in trade, $where there is little adversity, little conflict, little that is unpleasant, and one $who practices wrongly will not gain much fruit, not have much merit. 
It is $like that, young brahmin; going forth to train in the path is also like that. 
$Young brahmin, for one who lives at home there is much adversity, $much conflict, much that is unpleasant, but if they practice rightly, they $will gain much fruit, have much merit. 
It is just as in farming, where there $is much adversity, much conflict, much that is unpleasant, but one who $practices rightly will gain much fruit, have much merit. 
It is like that, $young brahmin; if one lives at home it is also like that. 
$Young brahmin, for one who has gone forth to train in the path there is $little adversity, little conflict, little that is unpleasant, and one who practices $rightly will gain much fruit, have much merit. 
It is just as in trade, where $there is little adversity, little conflict, little that is unpleasant, and one who $practices rightly will gain much fruit, have much merit. 
It is like that, young $brahmin; going forth to train in the path is also like that. 
$Young brahmin, this is how I speak. 
In speaking of these two states, I $have analyzed them like this, and proclaimed them like this. 
[In contrast,] $if a renunciant or brahmin is firmly entrenched in upholding a one-sided $position, they will say, “This is true; anything else is false.” $The young brahmin Suka said, “Gotama, the brahmins declare five prin￾ciples to be of much fruit, of much merit, as making for happiness and attaining $what is wholesome.” $The World-honored One said: $Those five principles, as declared by the brahmins to be of much fruit, of $much merit, making for happiness and attaining what is wholesome—$can you state them now, in this assembly? $203^taisho667c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$The young brahmin Suka said, “Gotama, certainly I can. 
Why is that? $Gotama, [because] I am now seated in this assembly.” $The World-honored One said, “So, please state them.” $The young brahmin Suka said: $Gotama, listen well! Gotama, the first principle that the brahmins declare $is truth, which is of much fruit, of much merit, making for happiness and $attaining what is wholesome. 
The second is recitation ...
the third is prac￾ticing generosity,198 ...
the fourth is ascetic practice ...
Gotama, the fifth $principle that the brahmins declare is celibacy, which is of much fruit, of $much merit, making for happiness and attaining what is wholesome. 
$The World-honored One said: $Since the brahmins declare five principles to be of much fruit, of much $merit, as making for happiness and attaining what is wholesome, is there $among these brahmins one brahmin who speaks like this: “As to these $five principles, having here and now come to know them myself, awakened $to them myself, realized them myself, I declare their fruit”? $The young brahmin Suka said to the World-honored One, “No, Gotama.” $The World-honored One said: $Does their teacher, or the teacher of their teacher, up to seven generations $of predecessors, speak like this, “As to these five principles, having here $and now come to know them myself, awakened to them myself, realized $them myself, I declare their fruit”? $The young brahmin Suka said to the World-honored One, “No, Gotama.” $Then the World-honored One asked: $Young brahmin, in ancient times there were brahmins who have since $died and passed away, reciters and memorizers of the sacred texts, trans￾mitters of the sacred texts, and reciters of the Vedas—one called Aṭṭhaka, $a second called Vāmaka, a third called Vāmadeva, a fourth called $Vessāmitta, a fifth called Yamataggi, a sixth called Aṅgīrasa, a seventh $called Vāseṭṭha, an eighth called Kassapa, a ninth called Bhāradvāja, and $a tenth called Bhagu—whom the present-day brahmins regard as skilled $204$Division 12$in textual recitation, as having practiced and trained in memorization. 
Did $any of them speak like this, “As to these five principles, having here and $now come to know them myself, awakened to them myself, realized them $myself, I declare their fruit”? $The young brahmin Suka said to the World-honored One, “No, Gotama. 
$But the brahmins base their faith on what they have memorized.”199$The World-honored One said: $Since there is among the brahmins not one brahmin who speaks like this: $“As to these five principles, having here and now come to know them $myself, awakened to them myself, realized them myself, I declare their $fruit”; and since there is no teacher, or teacher of a teacher, up to seven $generations of predecessors, who speaks like this: “As to these five prin￾ciples, having here and now come to know them myself, awakened to them $myself, realized them myself, I declare their fruit”; and since among brah￾mins of ancient times who have since died and passed away, reciters and $memorizers of the sacred texts, transmitters of the sacred texts, and reciters $of the Vedas—one called Aṭṭhaka, a second called Vāmaka, a third called $Vāmadeva, a fourth called Vessāmitta, a fifth called Yamataggi, a sixth $called Aṅgīrasa, a seventh called Vāseṭṭha, an eighth called Kassapa, a $ninth called Bhāradvāja, and a tenth called Bhagu—whom the present-day $brahmins regard as skilled in textual recitation, as having practiced and $trained in memorization, none spoke like this: “As to these five principles, $having here and now come to know them myself, awakened to them myself, $realized them myself, I declare their fruit”; young brahmin, for these $reasons, is not the faith of those brahmins in this without foundation? $The young brahmin Suka said, “Gotama, it is truly without foundation. 
$But the brahmins have heard it and then memorized it.” $The World-honored One said: $They are just like a group of blind children, each holding onto the other. 
$Those in front do not see what is behind and what is in the middle, those $in the middle do not see what is in front and what is behind, and those $behind do not see what is in the middle and what is in front. 
Young brah￾min, the generations of brahmins you speak of are just like that. 
Young $205^taisho668a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$brahmin, those in front speak out of faith and those coming after them $repeat what they have heard. 
$The young brahmin Suka became angry with the World-honored One. 
He $felt irritated and displeased, [wanting to] slander the World-honored One, to $provoke the World-honored One, to speak abusively to the World-honored $One. 
[Thinking:] “Gotama should be slandered; Gotama should be provoked; $Gotama should be toppled,” he said to the World-honored One: $The brahmin called Pokkarasāti of the Upamaññā clan speaks thus, “If $some renunciant or brahmin [claims], ‘I have now attained knowledge and $vision in a superhuman state,’ then on hearing this, I have a great laugh. 
$In my mind I disapprove of it as vain and untrue, as not in accordance with $the Dharma. 
How could a human being, born among human beings, pro￾claim themselves as having attained a superhuman state? If anyone says $of a superhuman state, ‘I know it; I see it,’ this is not right.” $Then the World-honored One thought: $The young brahmin Suka has become angry with me, feeling irritated and $displeased, [he wants to] slander me, to provoke me, to speak abusively $to me. 
[Thinking,] “Gotama should be slandered; Gotama should be pro￾voked; Gotama should be toppled,” he said to me, “Gotama, the brahmin $called Pokkarasāti of the Upamaññā clan speaks thus, ‘If some renunciant $or brahmin [claims], “I have now attained knowledge and vision in a $superhuman state,” then on hearing this, I have a great laugh. 
In my mind $I disapprove of it as vain and untrue, as not in accordance with the Dharma. 
$How could a human being, born among human beings, proclaim himself $as having attained a superhuman state? If anyone says of a superhuman $state, “I know it; I see it,” then this is not right.’” $Knowing this, the World-honored One said: $Young brahmin, does the brahmin Pokkarasāti of the Upamaññā clan $know the thoughts in the minds of all renunciants and brahmins so that $after that he speaks thus, “If some renunciant or brahmin [claims], ‘I have $now attained knowledge and vision in a superhuman state,’ then on hearing $this, I have a great laugh. 
In my mind I disapprove of it as vain and untrue, $206^taisho668b Division 12$as not in accordance with the Dharma. 
How could a human being, born $among human beings, proclaim himself as having attained a superhuman $state? If anyone says of a superhuman state, “I know it; I see it,” then this $is not right.’” $The young brahmin Suka replied: $Gotama, the brahmin Pokkarasāti of the Upamaññā clan has a female $slave called Punnikā, yet he is not able to know the thoughts in her mind. 
$How could he hope to know the thoughts in the minds of all renunciants $and brahmins? That he should know them is impossible. 
$The World-honored One said: $It is just as if a person born blind were to make this statement: “There are $no black or white objects, nor is there seeing of black or white objects. 
$There are no beautiful or ugly objects, nor is there seeing of beautiful or $ugly objects. 
There are no long or short objects, nor is there seeing of long $or short objects. 
There are no near or far objects, nor is there seeing of $near or far objects. 
There are no thick or slender objects, nor is there seeing $of thick or slender objects. 
From the beginning I have never seen or known $them, therefore there are no such objects.” Would this statement by that $person born blind be true? $The young brahmin Suka answered the World-honored One: $No Gotama. 
Why is that? There are black or white objects, and there is $seeing of black or white objects. 
There are beautiful or ugly objects, and $there is seeing of beautiful or ugly objects. 
There are long or short objects, $and there is seeing of long or short objects. 
There are near or far objects, $and there is seeing of near or far objects. 
There are thick or slender objects, $and there is seeing of thick or slender objects. 
If [the person] says, “From $the beginning I have never seen or known them, therefore there are no $such objects,” then this statement by the person born blind is not true. 
$[The World-honored One said,] “Young brahmin, in speaking as he does, $is the brahmin Pokkarasāti of the Upamaññā clan not like that man born $blind, without eyes?” $207$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$The young brahmin Suka answered the World-honored One, “Gotama, $he is as if blind.” $The World-honored One said: $Young brahmin, what do you think? As to those brahmins of ancient times $who have since died and passed away, reciters and memorizers of the $sacred texts, transmitters of the sacred texts, and reciters of the Vedas, $namely the brahmin Caṅkī, the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi, the brahmin Pokkara -$sāti, and your father Todeyya, is what they said to be accepted or not $accepted? Is it true or untrue? Should it be respected or despised?200$The young brahmin Suka replied to the World-honored One: $As to those brahmins of ancient times who have since died and passed $away, reciters and memorizers of the sacred texts, transmitters of the $sacred texts, and reciters of the Vedas, namely the brahmin Caṅkī, the $brahmin Jāṇussoṇi, the brahmin Pokkarasāti, and my father Todeyya, in $my mind I wish to accept what they said, not to reject it; I wish [to hold] $it as true, not as untrue; I wish to respect it, not to despise it. 
$Then the World-honored One asked: $Young brahmin, that statement by the brahmin Pokkarasāti of the Upa￾maññā clan: Is it not unacceptable, devoid of anything acceptable? Is it $not untrue, devoid of any truth? Is it not despicable, devoid of anything $to be respected? $The young brahmin Suka replied to the World-honored One, “[What you $say] is true, Gotama.” $[The World-honored One said:] $Again, young brahmin, there are five states that create obstruction, that $create obscuration, that create blindness and loss of sight, that are capable $of eroding wisdom, that tire one to no avail and do not lead to nirvana. 
$What are the five? Young brahmin, sensual desire is the first state that cre￾ates obstruction, that creates obscuration, that creates blindness and loss $of sight, that is capable of eroding wisdom, that tires one to no avail and $does not lead to nirvana. 
$208^taisho668c Division 12$Young brahmin, ill will ...

$doubt is the fifth state that creates obstruction, that creates obscuration, $that creates blindness and loss of sight, that is capable of eroding wisdom, $that tires one to no avail and does not lead to nirvana.201$Young brahmin, what do you think? That one who is obstructed by $these five states, obscured by them, entangled in them should, at will, $have insight into what is of benefit for themselves, or insight into what is $of benefit for others, or insight into what is of benefit for both, and [this $person] should know the thoughts in the minds of all renunciants and $brahmins? That is not possible. 
$Young brahmin, the brahmin Pokkarasāti of the Upamaññā clan is $stained by sensual desires, defiled by sensual desires. 
Touched by sensual $desires and dependent on sensual desires,202 he is attached to sensual $desires. 
He enters into sensual desires, not seeing the danger in them. 
Not $knowing the escape from them, he engages in sensual desires. 
He is $obstructed by these five states, obscured by them, entangled in them. 
That $he should, at will, have insight into what is of benefit for himself, or insight $into what is of benefit for others, or insight into what is of benefit for both, $and that he should know the thoughts in the minds of all renunciants and $brahmins—that is not possible. 
$Again, young brahmin, there are the five strands of sensual pleasure, $which are longed for, pleasing to the mind, of desirable appearance, con￾nected with sensual desire, and extremely pleasurable. 
What are the five? 669a$They are visible forms known by the eye, sounds known by the ear, odors $known by the nose, flavors known by the tongue, and tangibles known $by the body. 
Young brahmin, what do you think? Because of these five $strands of sensual pleasure, do living beings experience pleasure and joy, $[knowing] nothing that is superior to it? $The young brahmin Suka said to the World-honored One, “It is like this, $Gotama.” $The World-honored One asked him: $Young brahmin, what do you think? Of a fire that burns in dependence $on grass and wood and a fire that burns without grass and wood, which $one’s flame would be superior, more sublime, more superb? $209$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$The young brahmin Suka replied: $Gotama, that a fire might burn without grass and wood, that is not possible $except through supernormal power. 
[But,] Gotama, supposing that a fire $could burn without grass and wood, then its flame would be superior, $more sublime, more superb. 
$The World-honored One said: $It is like this, young brahmin, it is like this. 
That a fire might burn without $grass and wood, that is not possible except through supernormal power. 
$[But] supposing that a fire could burn without grass and wood, then its $flame would be superior, more sublime, more superb. 
$I shall now speak [in terms of that] supposition. 
Young brahmin, like $the fire that burns in dependence on grass and wood, such is the delight $and pleasure that living beings give rise to in dependence on sensual pleas￾ure and evil unwholesome states. 
They do not attain the pleasure of letting $go and the tranquility of appeasement. 
$Young brahmin, like the fire that burns without grass and wood, such $is the pleasure of letting go that living beings give rise to independence $on seclusion from sensual desires and through compliance with wholesome $states. 
They attain the pleasure of letting go and the tranquility of appease￾ment.203$The World-honored One said: $Young brahmin, what do you think? A brahmin performs a sacrifice and $practices generosity. 
Suppose a young warrior comes from the eastern $direction and says, “I will get the best of the seats, the best water for wash￾ing, and the best food and drink.” Not getting the best of the seats, the $best water for washing, or the best food and drink, he becomes resentful $and harbors a grudge. 
$Suppose a young brahmin comes from the southern direction and says, $“I will get pure fine food in here.” Not getting pure fine food in here, he $becomes resentful and harbors a grudge. 
Suppose a young merchant comes $from the western direction and says, “I will get plenty of food in here.” $Not getting plenty of food in here, he becomes resentful and harbors a $210$Division 12$grudge. 
Suppose a young worker comes from the northern direction and $says, “I will get much food in here.” Not getting much food in here, he $becomes resentful and harbors a grudge. 
Young brahmin, what fruit do $you declare for that brahmin practicing generosity in that way?204$The young brahmin Suka said: $Gotama, brahmins do not practice generosity with a mental attitude of $causing others to become resentful and harbor a grudge. 
Gotama, you $should know that brahmins practice generosity with a mental attitude of $empathy. 
By having a mental attitude of empathy when practicing gen￾erosity, they gain great merit. 
$The World-honored One said: $Then, young brahmin, do the brahmins not declare this as a sixth principle $that is of great fruit and great merit, making for happiness and attaining $what is wholesome? $The young brahmin Suka replied to the World-honored One, “That is so, $Gotama.” $The World-honored One asked: $Young brahmin, as to the five principles that the brahmins declare to be $of great fruit and great merit, making for happiness and attaining what is $wholesome, where do you see these principles often, among those who $live at home or among those who have gone forth to train in the path? $The young brahmin Suka replied: $Gotama, as to the five principles that the brahmins declare to be of great $fruit and great merit, as making for happiness and attaining what is whole￾some, I see these principles often among those who have gone forth to $train in the path, not among those who live at home. 
Why is that? $For one who lives at home there are many affairs, many activities, $there is much resentment, much quarreling, and one is not able to preserve $the truth. 
Gotama, for one who goes forth to train in the path there are $few affairs, few activities, there is little resentment and little quarreling, $and one is certainly able to preserve the truth. 
Gotama, as to the truth, I $211^taisho669b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$212$see it often among those who have gone forth to train in the path, not $among those who live at home. 
Why is that? $For one living at home there are many affairs, many activities, there $is much resentment, much quarreling, one is not able to practice gen￾erosity ...
not able to practice reciting ...
not able to practice asceticism ...
$not able to practice celibacy. 
Gotama, for one who goes forth to train in $the path there are few affairs, few activities, there is little resentment and $little quarreling, and one is certainly able to practice generosity ...
able $to practice reciting ...
able to practice asceticism ...
able to practice $celibacy. 
Gotama, as to the practice of celibacy, I see this principle often $among those who have gone forth to train in the path, not among those $who live at home. 
$The World-honored One said: $Young brahmin, the five principles that the brahmins declare to be of great $fruit and of great merit, making for happiness and attaining what is whole￾some, I say that they arise from the mind. 
What kind of mind? It is a mind $that is free of fetters or resentment, without ill will or contention, because $of having been cultivated.205$Young brahmin, what do you think? If a monk protects the truth, then $because of protecting the truth he gains gladness and gains joy. 
Young $brahmin, that gladness and that joy, I say, which are well conjoined with $what is wholesome, arise from the mind. 
What kind of mind? It is a mind $that is free of fetters or resentment, without ill will or contention, because $it has been cultivated. 
$Young brahmin, in this way [if] one is able to practice generosity ...
$one is able to gain learning ...
one is able to practice asceticism ...
one $is able to practice celibacy, and because of practicing celibacy [the person] $gains gladness and gains joy. 
Young brahmin, that gladness and that joy, $I say, which are well conjoined with what is wholesome, arise from the $mind. 
What kind of mind? It is a mind that is free of fetters or resentment, $without ill will or contention.206$With a mind imbued with loving-kindness, he dwells [mentally] per￾vading one direction, likewise the second, the third, and the fourth direction, ^taisho669c Division 12$and also the four intermediate directions and above and below, all around, $everywhere. 
With a mind imbued with loving-kindness, free of fetters or $resentment, without ill will or contention, he dwells pervading the entire $world [with a mind that is] boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well $cultivated. 
In the same way with a mind imbued with compassion ...
$with empathic joy ...
with equanimity, free of fetters or resentment, $without ill will or conflict, he dwells pervading the entire world [with a $mind that is] boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well cultivated. 
$Young brahmin, it is just as if there were a skilled conch-blower. 
He $goes to a place where nobody has ever heard [the sound of a conch]. 
He $mounts a high hill at midnight, and with all his might he blows the conch. 
$A wonderful sound comes out of it that pervades the four directions.

$The World-honored One asked: $Young brahmin, what do you think? Suppose that someone is seeking [to $become] Brahmā and, because of really seeking [to reach] the heaven of $Brahmā, he dwells with a lustful mind, [thinking,] “May I become Brahmā$or one among the Brahmā devas!” Suppose that someone [else] is seeking $[to become] Brahmā and, because of really seeking [to reach] the heaven $of Brahmā, he dwells free of fetters or resentment, without ill will or con￾tention, [with a mind that is] boundless, exalted, and well cultivated, with $a concentrated mind, mentally liberated; and [this person] dwells having $fully accomplished this, [thinking,] “May I become Brahmā or one among $the Brahmā devas!” As you see it, who [of these two] will become Brahmā$or one among the Brahmā devas? $The young brahmin Suka replied: $Gotama, if someone is seeking [to become] Brahmā and, because of really $seeking [to reach] the heaven of Brahmā dwells free of fetters or resent￾ment, without ill will or contention, [with a mind that is] boundless, exalted, $and well cultivated, with a concentrated mind, mentally liberated; and $[this person] dwells having fully accomplished this then, as I see it, they $will certainly become Brahmā or one among the Brahmā devas. 
$The young brahmin Suka asked, “Gotama, do you know the path to $Brahmā?”208$The World-honored One said: $Young brahmin, I will now ask you. 
Answer according to your under￾standing. 
Young brahmin, what do you think? Is the village of Naḷakāra $not far from this assembly? $214^taisho670a Division 12$The young brahmin Suka replied, “It is not far.” $The World-honored One said: $Young brahmin, what do you think? [Suppose] you tell someone in this $assembly, “You go to the village of Naḷakāra and, on arriving there, come $back right away.” [The person] receives your instructions, quickly goes $to the village of Naḷakāra and on arriving there, right away comes back. 
$When they have gone there and come back, you ask them about the route, $about the matter of going to the village of Naḷakāra, and coming back $from it. 
Would that person hesitate and be unable to reply? $The young brahmin Suka replied to the World-honored One, “No, Gotama.” $The World-honored One said: $Young brahmin, it might be that that person who has gone to the village $of Naḷakāra and come back, on being asked about the route, would hesitate $and be unable to reply. 
But if a tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awak￾ened, is asked about the path to Brahmā, it is impossible that [the tathāgata] $would hesitate even for a moment and be unable to reply. 
$The young brahmin Suka said to the World-honored One: $Renunciant Gotama, you are free from attachment and revered by the devas. 
You are accomplished in this matter. 
Therefore, on being asked $about the path to Brahmā you are able to reply promptly. 
World-honored $One, I have understood. 
Well-gone One, I have comprehended. 
World￾honored One, from now on I go for refuge to the Buddha, the Dharma, $and the Sangha of monks. 
May the World-honored One accept me as a $lay disciple from this day forth until the end of life, as having personally $gone for refuge for my whole life.209$Thus said the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the young $brahmin Suka was delighted and received it respectfully. 
$153. 
^ck The Discourse to Māgandiya210$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying among the Kurus in $the main quiet room of Bhāradvāja, seated on a seat of straw. 
$215$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Then, when the night was over, at dawn, the World-honored One put on $his [outer] robe, took his bowl, and went into Kammāsadhamma to beg for $almsfood in [proper] sequence [from house to house]. 
Having partaken of $the midday meal, he put away his [outer] robe and bowl, washed his hands $and feet, put his sitting mat over his shoulder, and went to a certain grove $for the day’s abiding. 
Then the World-honored One entered that grove, went $to the base of a tree, spread out the sitting mat, and sat down cross-legged. 
$At that time the heterodox practitioner Māgandiya, who was roaming $about in the afternoon, approached the main quiet room of Bhāradvāja. 
The $heterodox practitioner Māgandiya saw from afar that in the main quiet room $of Bhāradvāja there was straw [to serve as] a seat and as a place for lying $down on one’s side in the manner of a lion, in the manner of a renunciant, $in the manner of a brahmin.211 On seeing this, the heterodox practitioner $Māgandiya asked Bhāradvāja: $Whose is the straw seat, in your main quiet room, the place for lying down $on one’s side in the manner of a lion, in the manner of a renunciant, in $the manner of a brahmin? $The brahmin Bhāradvāja replied: $Māgandiya, there is the renunciant Gotama from the Sakya lineage who $left the Sakya clan, shaved off his hair and beard, donned the yellow robes, $and out of faith left the household life and became homeless to train in $the path. 
He has realized the unsurpassable right and total awakening. 
His $is the straw seat in the main quiet room, the place for lying down on one’s $side in the manner of a lion, in the manner of a renunciant, in the manner $of a brahmin. 
$The heterodox practitioner Māgandiya said: $Bhāradvāja, I am now seeing what should not be seen and hearing what $should not be heard, namely seeing the place where the renunciant Gotama $reclines. 
Why is that? The renunciant Gotama is a destroyer of the stages $[of growth] and a destroyer of the stages [of growth] is useless. 
$Bhāradvāja said: $216^taisho670b Division 12$Māgandiya, you should not condemn the renunciant Gotama on this $account. 
Why is that? The renunciant Gotama has much wisdom. 
Wise $warriors, wise brahmins, wise householders, and wise renunciants, who $are spoken of as wise ones, all gain noble knowledge [from him]. 
Māgan -$diya, I would like to tell the renunciant Gotama about this statement [of $yours]. 
May I do so? $Māgandiya said: $Bhāradvāja, if you want to tell him, then do as you wish. 
I have no objec￾tion. 
Bhāradvāja, if I were to see the renunciant Gotama, I too would tell $him this statement. 
Why is that? [Because] the renunciant Gotama is a $destroyer of the stages [of growth] and a destroyer of the stages [of growth] $is useless. 
$At that time the World-honored One was in the day’s abiding. 
With the $purified divine ear that surpasses the human [ear] he heard the brahmin $Bhāradvāja and the heterodox practitioner Māgandiya discussing this matter. 
$Having heard it, the World-honored One rose from sitting in meditation and $in the late afternoon approached the main quiet room of Bhāradvāja. 
He $spread out his sitting mat on the straw seat and sat down cross-legged. 
$The brahmin Bhāradvāja saw from afar the World-honored One [coming $back from] the grove, dignified and beautiful, like the moon amid the stars, 670c with a radiant aura, shining like a golden mountain, endowed with handsome $appearance and lofty dignity, and with sense faculties calm, free of obstruction, $accomplished and disciplined, with his mind calm and quiet.212 Having seen $the Buddha, he came forward to approach him, exchanged polite greetings, $stepped back, and sat to one side. 
$The World-honored One asked, “Bhāradvāja, did you have a conversation $with the heterodox practitioner Māgandiya about this straw seat?” $The brahmin Bhāradvāja answered the World-honored One:213 $That is so, Gotama. 
I had wanted to tell the renunciant Gotama about this $matter; however, before I had said it, the renunciant Gotama has already $come to know by himself. 
Why is that? Because he is a tathāgata, free $from attachment, fully awakened. 
$217$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$[While] the World-honored One and the brahmin Bhāradvāja were discussing $this matter, the heterodox practitioner Māgandiya, who was roaming around, $approached the main quiet room of Bhāradvāja. 
On seeing from afar that the $heterodox practitioner Māgandiya had come, the World-honored One said: $Māgandiya, one who does not restrain the eye faculty, does not guard it, $and does not practice doing so, certainly experiences suffering as a result. 
$That has been well restrained by the renunciant Gotama. 
He guards it $well, and practices well doing so, and he certainly experiences happiness $as a result. 
Māgandiya, is it for this reason that you say, “The renunciant $Gotama is a destroyer of the stages [of growth], and a destroyer of the $stages [of growth] is useless”? $The heterodox practitioner Māgandiya answered the World-honored One, $“That is so, Gotama.” $Māgandiya, in the same way, one who does not restrain the ear ...
the $nose ...
the tongue ...
the body faculty ...
the mind faculty, does not $guard it and does not practice doing so, will certainly experience suffering $as a result. 
That has been well restrained by the renunciant Gotama. 
He $guards it well, and practices well doing so, and he certainly experiences $happiness as a result. 
Māgandiya, is it for this reason that you say, “The $renunciant Gotama is a destroyer of the stages [of growth], and a destroyer $of the stages [of growth] is useless”? $The heterodox practitioner Māgandiya answered the World-honored One, $“That is so, Gotama.” $The World-honored One asked: $Māgandiya, what do you think? Suppose a person who, before going forth $to train in the path, cognizes with the eye forms that are longed for, pleasing $to the mind, and connected with sensual desires. 
At a later time he gives $up such forms cognized with the eye, shaves off his hair and beard, dons $the yellow robes, and out of faith leaves the household life and becomes $homeless to train in the path. 
Seeing as it really is the arising and ceasing $of forms cognized by the eye, [seeing] their attraction, their peril, and the $escape from them, he dwells with a mind at peace within. 
$218$Division 12$Suppose that he then sees [another] person who is not yet detached $from sensual desire for forms, who is consumed by craving for forms, $who becomes heated up by the fever of forms. 
When he sees that person $engaging with forms cognized by the eye, [forms] that are longed for, $pleasing to the mind, and connected with sensual desire, at that time he $does not praise them and does not rejoice with them. 
Māgandiya, what $do you think? When [he sees] this pleasure, which is dependent on craving $and dependent on forms, when that person is delighting in this pleasure, 671a he does not praise them, because it is trifling and tawdry; he does not $rejoice with them, because it is trifling and tawdry. 
Māgandiya, would $you have something to say to him?214$He answered the World-honored One, “No, Gotama.” $[The World-honored One asked:] $Māgandiya, what do you think? Suppose a person who, before going forth $to train in the path, in the same way cognizes sounds with the ear ...
$odors with the nose ...
tastes with the tongue ...
tangibles with the body, $[tangibles] that are longed for, pleasing to the mind, and connected with $sensual desire. 
Suppose that at a later time he gives up such tangibles cog￾nized with the body, shaves off his hair and beard, dons the yellow robes, $and out of faith leaves the household life and becomes homeless to train $in the path.

Māgandiya, what $do you think? When [he sees] this pleasure, which is dependent on craving $and dependent on tangibles, when that person is delighting in this pleasure, $he does not praise them, because it is trifling and tawdry; he does not $rejoice with them, because it is trifling and tawdry. 
Māgandiya, would $you have something to say to him? $219$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$He answered the World-honored One, “No, Gotama.” $The World-honored One asked:215$Māgandiya, what do you think? Suppose a person who, before going forth $to train in the path, is [equipped] with the five strands of sensual pleasure, $which are longed for, pleasing to the mind, and connected with sensual $desire. 
At a later time he gives up the five strands of sensual pleasure, $shaves off his hair and beard, dons the yellow robes, and out of faith leaves $the household life and becomes homeless to train in the path. 
Seeing as $it really is the arising and ceasing of the five strands of sensual pleasure, $their attraction, their peril, and the escape from them, he dwells with a $mind at peace within. 
$Suppose that he then sees [another] person who is not yet detached $from sensual desire, who is consumed by sensual craving, who becomes $heated up by the fever of sensual pleasures. 
When he sees that person $engaging with the five strands of sensual pleasures, which are longed for, $pleasing to the mind, and connected with sensual desire, at that time he $does not praise them and does not rejoice with them.

When [he sees] this pleasure, which is dependent on sensual $desire and dependent on sensual craving, when that person is delighting $in this pleasure, he does not praise them, because it is trifling and tawdry; $he does not rejoice with them, because it is trifling and tawdry. 
Māgandiya, $would you have something to say to him? $He answered the World-honored One, “No, Gotama.” $[The World-honored One said:] $Māgandiya, at the time before I had gone forth to train in the path, I $obtained easily, without difficulty, the five strands of sensual pleasure, $which are longed for, pleasing to the mind, and connected with sensual $desire.216 At a later time I gave up the five strands of sensual pleasure, $shaved off my hair and beard, donned the yellow robes, and out of faith $left the household life and became homeless to train in the path. 
Seeing $as it really is the arising and ceasing of the five strands of sensual pleasure, $their attraction, their peril, and the escape from them, I dwell with a mind $at peace within. 
$220$Division 12$I see a person who is not yet detached from sensual desire, who is con￾sumed by sensual craving, who becomes heated up by the fever of sensual $desire. 
When I see that person engaging with the five strands of sensual $pleasure, which are longed for, pleasing to the mind, and connected with 671b sensual desire, at that time I do not praise them and do not rejoice with $them. 
Māgandiya, what do you think? When [I see] this pleasure, which $is dependent on sensual desire and dependent on sensual craving, when $that person is delighting in this pleasure, I do not praise them, because it $is trifling and tawdry; I do not rejoice with them, because it is trifling and $tawdry. 
Māgandiya, have you something to say to me? $He answered the World-honored One, “No, Gotama.” $The World-honored One said: $Māgandiya, suppose [there is] a householder or the son of a householder $who enjoys much wealth and prosperity, immeasurable property, plentiful $livestock, tenants, and feudatories, and who is endowed with an abundance $of the various requisites of life. 
He obtains easily, without difficulty, the five $strands of sensual pleasure. 
He accomplishes good conduct of the body ...
$of speech ...
and good conduct of mind. 
When he is near death he does $not wish to let go of the five strands of sensual pleasure. 
With the breaking $up of the body at death he ascends to a good realm of existence and attains $rebirth in some heaven, where he dwells equipped with the five strands $of [heavenly] sensual pleasure. 
Māgandiya, would this deva or son of a deva prefer to give up the five strands of heavenly sensual pleasure, delight￾ing in human sensual pleasure and longing for it? $He answered the World-honored One: $No, Gotama. 
Why is that? Human sensual pleasure is foul and impure.217 To $his mind it would be extremely unclean and unapproachable. 
He would detest $it as wretched. 
Gotama, heavenly sensual pleasure is superior to human $sensual pleasure, more sublime, more excellent. 
That that deva or son of a $deva would give up the five strands of heavenly sensual pleasure, delighting $in human sensual pleasure and longing for it—that is not possible. 
$[The World-honored One said:] $221$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Māgandiya, in the same way, I abandoned human sensual pleasure and $crossed over to heavenly sensual pleasure by shaving off my hair and $beard, donning the yellow robes, and out of faith leaving the household $life and becoming homeless to train in the path. 
Seeing as it really is the $arising and ceasing of the five strands of sensual pleasure, their attraction, $their peril, and the escape from them, I dwell with a mind at peace within. 
$I see a person who is not yet detached from sensual desire, who is con￾sumed by sensual craving, who becomes heated up by the fever of sensual $desire. 
When I see that person engaging with the five strands of sensual $pleasure, which are longed for, pleasing to the mind, and connected with $sensual desire, at that time I do not praise them and do not rejoice with $them. 
Māgandiya, what do you think? When they have this pleasure, which $is dependent on sensual desire and dependent on sensual craving, when $that person is delighting in this pleasure, I do not praise them, because it $is trifling and tawdry; I do not rejoice with them, because it is trifling and $tawdry. 
Māgandiya, have you something to say to me? $He answered the World-honored One, “No, Gotama.” $The World-honored One said: $Māgandiya, suppose a person afflicted with leprosy, their body covered $in blisters, being eaten by maggots, who scratches their sores open with $their fingernails and goes to a firepit to cauterize them. 
Māgandiya, what $do you think? That person afflicted with leprosy, their body covered in $blisters, being eaten by maggots, who scratches their sores open with their $fingernails and goes to a firepit to cauterize them—would this person, by $this means, succeed in getting rid of their disease and becoming strong, $without damaging their faculties, shaking off the leprosy, with their body $becoming completely healthy, becoming just as it was before, returning $to its former condition?218$He answered the World-honored One: $No Gotama. 
Why is that? That person afflicted with leprosy, their body $covered in blisters, being eaten by maggots, who scratches their sores $open with their fingernails and goes to a firepit to cauterize them—by this $means they will cause even more sores to arise, and cause the earlier sores $222^taisho671c Division 12$to become bigger. 
Yet, they get pleasure from [scratching and cauterizing] $their leprosy sores. 
$[The World-honored One said:] $Māgandiya, just as that person afflicted with leprosy, their body covered $in blisters, being eaten by maggots, who scratches their sores open with $their fingernails and goes to a firepit to cauterize them and by this means $causes even more sores to arise, and the earlier sores to become bigger, $yet gets pleasure from their leprosy sores—in the same way, Māgandiya, $living beings who are not detached from sensual desire, who are consumed $by sensual craving, who become heated up by the fever of sensual desire, $nevertheless engage in sensual pleasure. 
$Māgandiya, in this way living beings who are not detached from sensual $desire, who are consumed by sensual craving, who become heated up by $the fever of sensual desire, nevertheless engage in sensual pleasure. 
In $this way their sensual desire increases, their sensual craving increases, $yet they get pleasure from their sensual craving. 
If they do not abandon $sensual desire, do not become detached from sensual craving, then it is $impossible that they should dwell, in the past, in the future, or in the $present, with a mind at peace within. 
Why is that? This is not the way to $abandon sensual desire and become detached from sensual craving, namely $engaging in sensual pleasures. 
$The World-honored One said: $Māgandiya, suppose a king or a great minister obtains the five strands of $sensual pleasures easily, without difficulty. 
If he does not abandon sensual $desire, does not become detached from sensual craving, then it is impossible $that he should dwell, in the past, in the future, or in the present, with a mind $at peace within. 
Why is that? This is not the way to abandon sensual desire $and become detached from sensual craving, namely engaging in sensual $pleasures. 
In this way, Māgandiya, living beings who are not detached from $sensual desire, who are consumed by sensual craving, who become heated $up by the fever of sensual desire, engage in sensual pleasures. 
$Māgandiya, if living beings are not detached from sensual desire, are $consumed by sensual craving, become heated up by the fever of sensual $223$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$desire, and engage in sensual pleasure, then in this way their sensual desire $increases, their sensual craving increases, yet they get pleasure from their $sensual craving. 
If they do not abandon sensual desire, do not become $detached from sensual craving, then it is impossible that they should dwell, $in the past, in the future, or in the present, with a mind at peace within. 
Why $is that? This is not the way to abandon sensual desire and become detached $from sensual craving, namely engaging in sensual pleasures. 
$Māgandiya, it is just like a person afflicted with leprosy, his body cov￾ered in blisters, being eaten by maggots, who scratches his sores open $with his fingernails and goes to a firepit to cauterize them. 
Out of empathy $and pity for him a person who seeks his welfare, who seeks his happiness $and peace, gives him good medicine appropriate to his condition. 
Having $taken that good medicine appropriate to his condition, he gets rid of the $disease and gains strength, without damage to his faculties. 
Having shaken $off the leprosy, his body becomes completely healthy, becomes just as it $was before, returned to its former condition. 
If he sees a person who is $afflicted by leprosy, his body covered in blisters, being eaten by maggots, $who scratches his sores open with his fingernails and goes to a firepit to $cauterize them, Māgandiya, having seen that person, would he feel delight $in his mind and praise him joyfully? $He answered the World-honored One, “No Gotama. 
Why is that? One $who is sick needs medication; one who is not sick does not need it.” $[The World-honored One said:] $Māgandiya, what do you think? Consider that leper who has gotten rid $of the disease in this way and gained strength, without damage to his fac￾ulties, having shaken off the leprosy, his body having become completely $healthy, become as it was before, returned to its former condition. 
If two $strong men seize him and take him to the firepit to cauterize him, then in $that situation he would be writhing in fear, trying to avoid having his body $scorched.219 Māgandiya, what do you think? Is it that the firepit is now $hotter, more painful, and more dangerous than previously? $He answered the World-honored One: $No, Gotama. 
Previously, when he was afflicted with leprosy, his body $224^taisho672a Division 12$covered in blisters, being eaten by maggots, and having scratched his $sores open with his fingernails and having gone to the firepit to cauterize $them, he perceived the pain as a greatly pleasurable contact, his mind $being deranged and his perception distorted. 
Gotama, having now gotten $rid of the disease in this way and having gained strength, without damage $to his faculties, having shaken off the leprosy, his body completely healthy, $becoming just as it was before, returned to its former condition, he per￾ceives what is painful as greatly painful, his mind being composed and $his perception not being distorted. 
$[The World-honored One said:] $Māgandiya, just as a person afflicted with leprosy, his body covered in $blisters, being eaten by maggots, scratching his sores open with his fin￾gernails and going to a firepit to cauterize them, perceives what is painful $as a greatly pleasurable contact, his mind being deranged and his perception $distorted—in the same way, Māgandiya, living beings who are not detached $from sensual desire, who are consumed by sensual craving, who become $heated up by the fever of sensual desire and engage in sensual pleasures, $perceive sensual pleasures that are painful as pleasurable, their minds $being deranged and their perceptions distorted. 
$Māgandiya, just as that person who has gotten rid of the disease and $gained strength, without damage to his faculties, having shaken off the $leprosy, his body becoming completely healthy, just as it was before, $returned to its former condition, perceives what is painful as greatly painful $contact, his mind being composed and his perception no longer distorted—$in the same way, Māgandiya, I perceive sensual pleasures that are painful $as painful, because I have attained the truth and my perception is not dis￾torted. 
Why is that? $Māgandiya, in the past sensual pleasure was impure and foul, very dirty $and objectionable to the mind, to be disliked as painful to touch. 
In the $future ...
In the present, sensual pleasure is impure and foul, very dirty $and objectionable to the mind, to be disliked as painful to touch. 
Māgandiya, $the Tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened, says: $Freedom from disease is the supreme gain; $Nirvana is the supreme happiness.220$225$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$The heterodox practitioner Māgandiya said to the World-honored One: $Gotama, in the past I also heard from ancient senior elders who practiced $the holy life, $Freedom from disease is the supreme gain; $Nirvana is the supreme happiness. 
$The World-honored One asked him: $Māgandiya, if you heard in the past from ancient senior elders who prac￾ticed the holy life, $Freedom from disease is the supreme gain; $Nirvana is the supreme happiness. 
$Māgandiya, what is freedom from disease? What is nirvana? $At this, the heterodox practitioner Māgandiya stroked with both hands $his body—which is [comparable to] an illness, a tumor, a thorn, a snake, $which is impermanent, dukkha, empty, not-self—and said, “Gotama, this is $freedom from disease. 
This is nirvana.”221$The World-honored One said: $Māgandiya, it is just as if someone born blind were to hear a person with $eyesight say, “Pure white, without a stain; pure white without a stain,” and $having heard this, were to go searching for this pure whiteness. 
A swindler, $not seeking [the blind person’s] welfare, not seeking his happiness and $peace, hands him a dirty, greasy, impure cloth and says, “You should know, $this is a pure white, stainless cloth. 
Respectfully accept it with both hands $and wear it on your body.” The blind person is delighted, respectfully $accepts it with both hands, and puts it on his body, saying, “Pure white, $without a stain; pure white without a stain.” Māgandiya, does that person $speak knowing for himself or does he speak not knowing for himself? $Does he speak seeing for himself or does he speak not seeing for himself? $The heterodox practitioner Māgandiya replied, “Gotama, from what you $say, he really does not know or see.” $The World-honored One said: $226^taisho672b Division 12$In the same way, Māgandiya, like a blind person, without eyes, you have $stroked with both hands your body—which is [comparable to] an illness, $a tumor, a thorn, a snake, which is impermanent, dukkha, empty, not￾self—and said, “Gotama, this is freedom from disease. 
This is nirvana.” $Māgandiya, you have never experienced freedom from disease. 
How $much less could you know and see nirvana? It is impossible for you to $say that you know and see it. 
Māgandiya, the Tathāgata, free from attach￾ment, fully awakened, says, $Freedom from disease is the supreme gain. 
$Nirvana is the supreme happiness. 
$Of all paths the eightfold right path $Leads to peace, to the deathless.222$Many people have heard of this, and many heterodox practitioners, having $heard this stanza, have handed it down in turn, unable to understand its $meaning. 
Having heard it they wish to seek instruction; [but,] being equally $foolish, they mislead one another.223$Their own present body is made up of the four elements, born of father $and mother, to be nourished by food and drink constantly, to be clothed, $massaged, and bathed, having to endure being mishandled, which is of a $nature to deteriorate, to wear away, to fall apart. 
They see it as a self, cling $to it as a self. 
Conditioned by clinging there is becoming; conditioned by $becoming there is birth; conditioned by birth there are old age and death; 672c conditioned by old age and death there are worry and woe, weeping and $tears, sorrow and pain, distress and vexation. 
Thus arises this great mass $of pure dukkha.224$Then the heterodox practitioner Māgandiya rose from his seat, arranged $his robe to bare one shoulder, extended his hands with joined palms toward $the Buddha, and said: $Gotama, I now have complete faith in the renunciant Gotama. 
May the $renunciant Gotama well teach me the Dharma so that I come to know $what is freedom from disease, what is nirvana. 
$The World-honored One said: $227$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Māgandiya, if the eye of noble wisdom is not yet purified in you and I $were to teach you the freedom from disease, nirvana, you would not be $able to understand, and that would just be troublesome for me. 
Māgandiya, $it is just as with a person born blind and someone else tells him, “You $should know there are the colors blue, yellow, red, and white.” Māgandiya, $because of what that other person said, would the person born blind know $the colors blue, yellow, red, and white?225$He answered the World-honored One, “No, Gotama.” $[The World-honored One said:] $In the same way, Māgandiya, if the eye of noble wisdom is not purified in $you and I were to teach you the freedom from disease, nirvana, you would $not be able to understand, and that would just be troublesome for me. 
$Māgandiya, I shall tell you of a good medicine appropriate to your $condition, to purify the unpurified eye of noble wisdom in you. 
Māgandiya, $if the eye of noble wisdom becomes purified in you, you will understand $for yourself what is freedom from disease, what is nirvana. 
$Māgandiya, it is just as with a person born blind, whose relatives, out $of empathy, seeking his welfare and seeking his happiness, call an eye $doctor. 
That eye doctor gives him various treatments, such as [inducing] $vomiting, [administering] a laxative, nasal instillations, rectal instillations, $pricking the veins, or causing tears to flow. 
Māgandiya, it is possible that $he recovers sight in both eyes. 
$Māgandiya, if he recovers sight in both eyes, he sees for himself the $colors blue, yellow, red, and white. 
He sees that dirty, greasy, impure cloth $and thinks, “That person is my enemy. 
For a long time he has cheated me $with this dirty greasy cloth.” He hates him, Māgandiya, and might even $be capable of killing him. 
$In the same way, Māgandiya, I shall tell you of a good medicine appro￾priate to your condition, to purify the unpurified eye of noble wisdom in $you. 
Māgandiya, if the eye of noble wisdom becomes purified in you, you $will understand for yourself what is freedom from disease, what is nirvana. 
$Māgandiya, there are four principles that lead to purification of the eye $of noble wisdom that has not yet been purified. 
What are the four? They $are associating in a respectful and receptive manner with good friends, hear-$228$Division 12$ing the good Dharma, giving it proper attention, and advancing in the Dharma $in accordance with the Dharma.226 Māgandiya, you should train like this. 
$Associate in a respectful and receptive manner with good friends! Hear the 673a good Dharma! Give it proper attention! Advance in the Dharma in accordance $with the Dharma! Māgandiya, you should train like this. 
$Māgandiya, having associated in a respectful and receptive manner $with good friends, you will hear the good Dharma. 
Having heard the good $Dharma, you will give it proper attention. 
Having given it proper attention, $you will advance in the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma. 
Having $advanced in the Dharma in accordance with the Dharma, you will know $dukkha as it really is, you will know the arising of dukkha ...
, you will $know the cessation of dukkha ...
and you will know the path leading to $the cessation of dukkha as it really is.227$What is knowledge of dukkha as it really is? It is that birth is dukkha;$old age is dukkha; disease is dukkha; death is dukkha; association with what $is disliked is dukkha; separation from what is loved is dukkha; being unable $to get what one wishes is dukkha; in short, the five aggregates affected by $clinging are dukkha. 
This is knowledge of dukkha as it really is. 
$What is knowledge of the arising of dukkha as it really is? It is craving, $which brings future existence and is accompanied by delight and desire, $wishing for this or that existence. 
This is knowledge of the arising of $dukkha as it really is. 
$What is knowledge of the cessation of dukkha as it really is? It is the $remainderless cessation of craving, which brings future existence and is $accompanied by delight and desire, wishing for this or that existence, its $eradication, giving up, vomiting out, termination, fading away, disappear￾ance, and appeasement. 
This is knowledge of the cessation of dukkha as $it really is. 
$What is knowledge of the path [leading to] the cessation of dukkha as $it really is? It is the noble eightfold path, right view ...
up to ...
right $concentration; these are the eight. 
This is knowledge of the path [leading $to] the cessation of dukkha as it really is. 
$When this teaching was given, there arose in the heterodox practitioner $Māgandiya the spotless, immaculate Dharma eye in regard to all phenomena.228 $229$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Then the heterodox practitioner Māgandiya saw the Dharma, attained the $Dharma, realized the bright pure Dharma; he abandoned doubt, went beyond $perplexity; he became independent of other teachers, would never again $follow others; and he became free of hesitation. 
Having been established in $the attainment of the fruit, he had attained fearlessness in the Dharma taught $by the World-honored One. 
$Then he rose from his seat, paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s $feet, and said, “World-honored One, may I obtain the going forth to train in $the path, receive the full ordination, and become a monk?” $The World-honored One said, “Welcome, monk! Practice the holy life!”229 $The heterodox practitioner Māgandiya obtained the going forth to train in $the path. 
He received the full ordination and became a monk. 
Māgandiya, $having gone forth to train in the path, having received the full ordination, $came to know the Dharma and attained arahantship. 
$Thus said the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, Venerable $Māgandiya was delighted and received it respectfully. 
$154. 
^ck The Discourse to Vāseṭṭha at the $Hall [of Migāra’s Mother]230$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in the $Eastern Park, in the Hall of Migāra’s Mother. 
$At that time there were two members of the brahmin class, Vāseṭṭha and $Bhāradvāja, who had shaved off their hair and beards, donned the yellow $robes, and out of faith left the household life and become homeless to train $in the path.231 Any brahmins who saw them rebuked them severely and with $much bitterness, saying: $Brahmins are the highest class; others are not equal to it. 
The brahmin $class is white; all others are black. 
Brahmins attain purity; nonbrahmins $do not attain purity. 
Brahmins are children of Brahmā, born from his $mouth; brahmins were created by Brahmā. 
You have given up what is $superior to follow what is not equal to it. 
You have given up what is white $to follow what is black. 
Those bald-pated renunciants are bound by [their $own] darkness, their lineage is severed since they are without sons. 
There￾fore, what you have done is a great evil, the ultimate crime, a great fault.232$230^taisho673b Division 12$231$At that time the World-honored One, having risen from sitting in medi￾tation, had come down from the hall in the afternoon and was walking back $and forth in the open, in the shade of the hall, teaching the monks the profound $and sublime Dharma. 
Venerable Vāseṭṭha saw from afar that the World-hon￾ored One, having risen from sitting in meditation, had come down from the $hall in the afternoon and was walking back and forth in the open in the shade $of the hall, teaching the monks the profound and sublime Dharma. 
$Seeing this, Venerable Vāseṭṭha said: $Venerable Bhāradvāja, you should know that the World-honored One, $having risen from sitting in meditation, has come down from the hall in $the afternoon and is walking back and forth in the open in the shade of $the hall, teaching the monks the profound and sublime Dharma. 
Venerable $Bhāradvāja, let us together approach the Buddha. 
Perhaps we will thereby $be able to hear the Dharma from the Buddha. 
$Then Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja approached the Buddha, paid homage by $bowing their heads [to his feet], and followed him, walking back and forth. 
$The World-honored One turned around and said to the two: $Vāseṭṭha, you two are brahmins who have left the brahmin class, shaved $off hair and beards, donned the yellow robes, and out of faith left the $household life and became homeless to train in the path. 
On seeing this, $do the brahmins not greatly rebuke you? $[Vāseṭṭha] replied, “Indeed, World-honored One, on seeing this, the brah￾mins severely scold and rebuke us with much bitterness.” $The World-honored One asked, “Vāseṭṭha, how do the brahmins, on seeing $this, severely scold and rebuke you with much bitterness?” $[Vāseṭṭha] replied: $World-honored One, on seeing us, the brahmins say, “Brahmins are the $highest class; the others are not equal to it. 
The brahmin class is white; $all the others are black. 
Brahmins attain purity; nonbrahmins do not attain $purity. 
Brahmins are children of Brahmā, born from his mouth; brahmins $were created by Brahmā. 
You have given up what is superior to follow $what is not equal to it. 
You have given up the white to follow the black. 
^taisho673c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Those bald-pated renunciants are bound by [their own] darkness. 
Their $lineage is severed, since they are without sons. 
Therefore, what you have $done is a great evil, the ultimate crime, a great fault.” World-honored One, $on seeing us, this is how the brahmins severely scold and rebuke us with $much bitterness. 
$The World-honored One said: $Vāseṭṭha, what those brahmins say is most evil, extremely troublesome,233$and lacking foundation. 
Why is that? It is because they are foolish, have $poor understanding, do not recognize a fertile field [of merit], and cannot $know for themselves, that they say,234 “We brahmins are children of $Brahmā, born from his mouth. 
We brahmins were created by Brahmā.” $Why is that? $Vāseṭṭha, regarding this unsurpassable knowledge and conduct that I $have realized, I do not talk about superiority based on birth, I do not talk $about lineage, I do not talk about matters of pride, about someone being $to my liking or not to my liking because of status or because of [ritual $purification by] water, or [because of] the sacred texts they study.235$Vāseṭṭha, if people are getting married, they ought to talk about their $birth, they ought to talk about their lineage, they ought to talk about matters $of pride, about someone being to their liking or not to their liking because $of status or because of [ritual purification by] water, or [because of] the $sacred texts they study. 
$Vāseṭṭha, if someone values birth, values lineage, values matters of $pride, then [this person] is very far from the unsurpassable knowledge $and conduct that I have realized. 
Vāseṭṭha, one who talks about birth, talks $about lineage, talks about matters of pride, about someone being to their $liking or not to their liking because of status or because of [ritual purifi-$cation by] water, or [because of] the sacred texts they study, is separated $from the supreme knowledge and conduct that I have realized. 
$Again, Vāseṭṭha, as for the three classes, they do not make all people $quarrel with one another about their various wholesome and unwholesome $qualities. 
They are praised or not praised by noble ones. 
$What are the three? The warrior class, the brahmin class, and the mer￾chant class.236 Vāseṭṭha, what do you think? Is it that a warrior kills living $232$Division 12$beings, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, speaks $falsehood ...
up to ...
has wrong view, and a merchant does the same $but a brahmin does not? $[Vāseṭṭha] replied: $World-honored One, a warrior may kill living beings, take what is not $given, engage in sexual misconduct, speak falsehood ...
up to ...
have $wrong view; and so too may a brahmin or a merchant. 
$The World-honored One asked: $Vāseṭṭha, what do you think? Is it that a brahmin abstains from killing, $having abandoned killing ...
taking what is not given ...
engaging in sexual $misconduct ...
speaking falsehood ...
up to ...
abstaining from wrong $view having gained right view; but a warrior or a merchant does not? $[Vāseṭṭha] replied: $World-honored One, a brahmin may abstain from killing, having abandoned $killing ...
taking what is not given ...
engaging in sexual misconduct ...
674a speaking falsehood ...
up to ...
abstaining from wrong view having $gained right view; and so too may a warrior or a merchant. 
$The World-honored One asked: $Vāseṭṭha, what do you think? Are the countless evil and unwholesome $things practiced [only] by warriors and merchants and not by brahmins? $Are the countless wholesome things practiced [only] by brahmins and not $by warriors and merchants? $[Vāseṭṭha] replied: $World-honored One, there being countless evil and unwholesome things, $they may be practiced by warriors and merchants, and similarly also by $brahmins. 
There being countless wholesome things, they may be practiced $by brahmins, and similarly also by warriors and merchants. 
$[The World-honored One said:] $Vāseṭṭha, if the countless evil and unwholesome things were consistently $233$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$234$practiced only by warriors and merchants and not by brahmins, and if the $countless wholesome things were consistently practiced by brahmins and $not by warriors and merchants, then the brahmins would be able to make $this statement, “We brahmins are children of Brahmā, born from his mouth; $brahmins are created by Brahmā.” Why is that? $Vāseṭṭha, it is seen that brahmin women first get married; and after $having been married it is seen that they at some time become pregnant; $and after having become pregnant it is seen that they at some time give $birth to a boy or a girl. 
Thus, Vāseṭṭha, brahmins are born in the usual $way, through the [mother’s] birth canal. 
However, they lie and slander $Brahmā by saying, “We brahmins are children of Brahmā, born from his $mouth. 
Brahmins are created by Brahmā.” $Vāseṭṭha, if clansmen, from various clans, with various surnames, leave $those various clans and, having shaved off their hair and beards, don the $yellow robes, and out of faith leave the household life and become home￾less to train in the path under me, then they should say, “We brahmins are $children of Brahmā, born from his mouth, brahmins created by Brahmā.” $Why is that? Vāseṭṭha, those sons of clansmen who have entered my $true Dharma and discipline and accepted my true Dharma and discipline $reach the further shore. 
Abandoning doubt, transcending perplexity, becom￾ing free of hesitation, they attain fearlessness in the Dharma of the World￾honored One. 
Therefore they can say, “We brahmins are children of $Brahmā, born from his mouth, brahmins created by Brahmā.” $Vāseṭṭha, that “Brahmā” refers to the Tathāgata, free from attachment, $fully awakened. 
“Brahmā” is the Tathāgata. 
“The Cool” is the Tathāgata, $who is without distress, without heat, and who never leaves that state. 
$This is the Tathāgata. 
$Vāseṭṭha, what do you think? Do the Sakyans humble themselves and, $with affectionate respect, support and revere King Pasenadi of Kosala? $He replied, “That is so, World-honored One.” $The World-honored One asked: $Vāseṭṭha, what do you think? As the Sakyans humble themselves and, $with affectionate respect, support and revere King Pasenadi of Kosala, ^taisho674b Division 12$does Pasenadi, the king of Kosala, in this way humble himself and, with $affectionate respect, support and revere me? $[Vāseṭṭha] answered the World-honored One, saying: $That the Sakyans humble themselves and, with affectionate respect, support $and revere King Pasenadi of Kosala—this is not remarkable. 
That King $Pasenadi of Kosala humbles himself and, with affectionate respect, supports $and reveres the World-honored One—this is indeed remarkable. 
$The World-honored One said: $Vāseṭṭha, when King Pasenadi of Kosala humbles himself before my body $and, with affectionate respect, supports and reveres me, he does not have $this in his mind, “The renunciant Gotama is from the superior class; my $class is inferior. 
The renunciant Gotama has much wealth; I have little $wealth.237 The renunciant Gotama is of beautiful appearance; my appearance $is not beautiful. 
The renunciant Gotama has great might; I have little might. 
$The renunciant Gotama has good knowledge; I have bad knowledge.”238$Instead, Vāseṭṭha, because King Pasenadi of Kosala has affectionate $respect for the Dharma, supports it and reveres it, therefore he humbles $himself before my body and, with affectionate respect, supports and $reveres me. 
$Then the World-honored One said to the monks: $Vāseṭṭha, there comes a time when this world goes to total destruction. 
$When this world goes to destruction, any living beings that exist are reborn $among the devas of Radiance (ābhassarā-devā). 
There they have subtle $bodies that are mind-made, completely endowed with all limbs and fac￾ulties, and feeding on joy. 
With [their] self-luminous bodies they rise up $into space, pure and beautiful, and remain [there] for a long time. 
$Vāseṭṭha, there comes a time when [the space that was formerly occupied $by] the great earth becomes filled with water. 
The surface of that ocean is $stirred up by the wind and condenses as an essence that coagulates. 
It is just $as when milk is churned, butter condenses as an essence that coagulates. 
$In the same way, Vāseṭṭha, there comes a time when [the space that $was formerly occupied by] the great earth becomes filled with water; and $235$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$236$the surface of that ocean is stirred up by the wind and condenses as an $essence that coagulates. 
From this arises an earthly savor that has color, $fragrance, and flavor. 
What color is it? It is like the color of fresh butter and $mature butter. 
What flavor does it have? It is like the flavor of honey balls. 
$Vāseṭṭha, there comes a time when this world again comes into being. 
$At that time any living beings that have been reborn among the devas of $Radiance, with the exhaustion of their life span, the exhaustion of their $karma, and the exhaustion of their merit, die and are reborn here as people. 
$Having been reborn here, they [still] have subtle bodies that are mind￾made, completely endowed with all limbs and faculties, and feeding on $joy. 
With [their] self-luminous bodies they rise up into space, pure and $beautiful, and remain there for a long time. 
$Vāseṭṭha, at that time in the world there were no sun and moon, no $constellations of stars, no day and night, no month or half month, and no $seasons and no years. 
Vāseṭṭha, at that time there was no [distinction $between] father and mother, no [distinction between] male and female, $and also no [distinction between] master and slave. 
There were just equally $ranked living beings. 
$Then one living being, who was greedy, gluttonous, and corrupt, had $this thought, “What is the flavor of the earth? Let me take this flavorsome $earth on my finger and taste it.” $Then that being took the flavorsome earth on his finger and tasted it. 
In $this way that living being came to know the flavor of the earth. 
He wanted $to get more of it to eat. 
Then that being further had this thought, “Why $should I tire myself by using my finger to eat the flavorsome earth. 
Let me $now rather use my hands to gather up this flavorsome earth and eat it.” Then $that being used his hands to gather up the flavorsome earth and ate it. 
$Among those beings there were others who, seeing that being gathering $up the flavorsome earth with his hands and eating it, thought, “This is $truly skillful. 
This is truly ingenious. 
Let us too gather up this flavorsome $earth with our hands and eat it!” Then those beings gathered up the fla￾vorsome earth with their hands and ate it. 
$To the extent that those beings gathered up the flavorsome earth with $their hands and ate it, to that extent their bodies became fatter, heavier, and ^taisho674c Division 12$more solid. 
The formerly clear and pure [luminosity] of their complexion $disappeared and darkness naturally arose. 
$Vāseṭṭha, it is a rule of the world that this naturally happens: if darkness $arises, sun and moon must arise; once sun and moon have arisen, the con￾stellations of stars arise; once the constellation of stars have arisen, day $and night come into being; once day and night have come into being, there $are months and half months, seasons and years. 
Those [beings] ate the $flavorsome earth and remained in the world for a long time. 
$Vāseṭṭha, those beings that ate much of the flavorsome earth came to $be of ugly complexion; those who ate little of the flavorsome earth came $to be of beautiful complexion. 
From then on they understood complexions $as superior or inferior. 
Because of their superior or inferior complexions, $beings despised one another, saying, “My complexion is superior; your $complexion is not equal to it.” When, because of superiority and inferiority $of complexion, arrogance and evil mind states had arisen, the flavorsome $earth disappeared. 
$When the flavorsome earth had disappeared, the beings came together $with much crying and lamenting, saying, “What has become of the fla￾vorsome earth? What has become of the flavorsome earth?” $It is just as, nowadays, a person who has let some delicious morsel dis￾solve in their mouth similarly <says> those ancient words.239 Even though $they have heard [those ancient words] and bear them in mind, they do not $understand their meaning. 
The meaning of this saying should be regarded $as just this. 
$Vāseṭṭha, after the flavorsome earth had disappeared, there arose for $those beings an earth-fat that had color, fragrance, and flavor. 
What color $did it have? It was like the color of fresh butter and mature butter. 
What $flavor did it have? It was like the flavor of honey balls. 
Those [beings] 675a ate this earth-fat and remained in the world for a long time. 
$Vāseṭṭha, if beings ate much of the earth-fat, they came to be of ugly $complexion; those who ate little of the earth-fat came to be of beautiful $complexion. 
From then on they understood complexions as superior or $inferior. 
Because of their superior or inferior complexions, beings despised $one another, saying, “My complexion is superior; your complexion is not $237$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$equal to it.” When, because of superiority and inferiority of complexion, $arrogance and evil mind states had arisen, the earth-fat disappeared. 
$When the earth-fat had disappeared, the beings came together with $much crying and lamenting, saying, “What has become of the earth-fat? $What has become of the earth-fat?” It is just as, nowadays, a person who $is being reproached by another similarly <says> those ancient words. 
$Even though they have heard [those ancient words] and bear them in mind, $they do not understand their meaning. 
The meaning of this saying should $be regarded as just this. 
$Vāseṭṭha, after the earth-fat had disappeared, there arose for those $beings a creeper that had color, fragrance, and flavor. 
What color did it $have? It was like the color of the kadamba flower. 
What flavor did it have? $It was like the flavor of sticky honey balls. 
Those [beings] ate the creeper $and remained in the world for a long time. 
$Vāseṭṭha, those beings that ate much of the creeper came to be of ugly $complexion; those who ate little of the creeper came to be of beautiful $complexion. 
From then on they understood complexions as superior or $inferior. 
Because of their superior or inferior complexions, beings despised $one another, saying, “My complexion is superior; your complexion is not $equal to it.” When, because of superiority and inferiority of complexion, $arrogance and evil mind states had arisen, the creeper disappeared. 
$When the creeper had disappeared, the beings came together with much $crying and lamenting, saying, “What has become of the creeper? What $has become of the creeper?” It is just as, nowadays, a person who is being $touched by bitter experiences similarly <says> those ancient words. 
Even $though they have heard [those ancient words] and bear them in mind, they $do not understand their meaning. 
The meaning of this saying should be $regarded as just this. 
$Vāseṭṭha, after the creeper had disappeared, there arose for those beings $natural nonglutinous rice, which was white, clean, without husks, and $without stalks, four inches long. 
Harvested in the morning, it would be $grown [again] by the evening; harvested in the evening, it would be grown $[again] by the morning. 
It had a salty taste when cooked and did not give $rise to wind. 
The beings ate this natural nonglutinous rice. 
$238$Division 12$As those beings ate the natural nonglutinous rice, those beings came $to be of different shapes. 
Some beings came to be of male shape; some $beings came to be of female shape. 
Since those beings had come to have $male or female shape, on looking at each other they said, “An evil being $has appeared; an evil being has appeared.” $Vāseṭṭha, “an evil being has appeared” refers to the [appearance of $men and] women. 
As those beings had male and female shapes, those $beings observed each other more. 
Having observed each other more, they $eyed each other more and more. 
Having eyed each other more and more, $they became more and more desirous of each other. 
Having become more 675b and more desirous of each other, they became overwhelmingly heated up. 
$Having become overwhelmingly heated up, they had craving and attach￾ment for each other. 
Having craving and attachment for each other, they $engaged in sensual behavior. 
$When people saw others engaging in sensual behavior, they struck $them with sticks and stones or threw staves and clods at them, saying, $“Woe betide you! You evil beings are doing what is against the Dharma. 
$How can beings do this together?” It was just as nowadays people greet $the bride and scatter simple flowers over her240 or place a flower garland $on her and say, “Peace to the bride! Peace to the bride!” Thus what was $formerly undesirable has now become desirable. 
$Vāseṭṭha, when beings were embarrassed by these evil impure things, $which are detestable, and felt ashamed of them, they withdrew from the $crowd for a day, or two days, up to six or seven days, half a month, one $month, up to a year [to engage in them]. 
$Vāseṭṭha, when beings wanted to get to engage in this impure practice, $they constructed houses and said, “In here one can do evil; in here one $can do evil!” Vāseṭṭha, in the world this is the first cause and condition $for the coming into being of the principle of house [construction]. 
This $is ancient knowledge, primary knowledge. 
It is in accordance with the $Dharma, not contrary to the Dharma; and, being in accordance with the $Dharma, it is respected by the people. 
$Among them was one being who was lazy and thought,241 “Why do I $every day keep going [repeatedly] to get the natural nonglutinous rice? $239$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$What if I were to get all the rice for one day just once?” Then he got all $the rice to eat for one day just once. 
Then a certain [other] being said to $that being, “Being, shall we go together to get rice?” $The [first] one replied, “I have gotten it already, all at once. 
You go $and get it by yourself.” On hearing this, the [second] being thought, “This $is truly skillful. 
This is truly ingenious. 
What if I were to get the rice to $be eaten tomorrow at once as well?” Then he also got the rice for the next $day at once and brought it back. 
Another [third] being said to that [second] $being, “Being, shall we go together to get rice?” $That one replied, “I have already gotten the rice for tomorrow at once $and brought it back. 
You go and get it by yourself.” On hearing this, the $being thought, “This is truly skillful. 
This is truly ingenious. 
What if I $were now to get rice to eat for seven days all at once and bring it back?” $Then that being got rice for seven days at once and brought it back. 
$Because those beings took the natural nonglutinous rice excessively $and stored it up, overnight the nonglutinous rice developed a skinlike husk. 
$Having been harvested for up to seven days, it similarly developed a skinlike $husk, and the places where it had been harvested did not grow back. 
$Then those beings came together with much crying and lamenting, $saying: $We have given rise to evil and unwholesome states, in that we collected $and stored up rice overnight. 
Why is that? Previously we had subtle $bodies that were mind-made, completely endowed with all limbs and $faculties, feeding on joy, self-luminous bodies. 
Rising up into space, $our pure bodies remained for a long time. 
A flavorsome earth arose for $us, which had color, fragrance, and taste. 
What color did it have? It $was like the color of fresh butter or mature butter. 
What flavor did it $have? It was like the flavor of honey balls. 
We ate the flavorsome earth $and remained in the world for a long time. 
$Those of us who ate much of the flavorsome earth came to be of $ugly complexion; those who ate little of the flavorsome earth came to $be of beautiful complexion. 
From then on we understood complexions $as superior or inferior. 
Because of our superior or inferior complexions, $we despised one another, saying, “My complexion is superior; your $240^taisho675c Division 12$complexion is not equal to it.” When, because of superiority and infe￾riority of complexion, arrogance and evil mind states had arisen, the $flavorsome earth disappeared. 
$After the flavorsome earth had disappeared, there arose for us an $earth-fat that had color, fragrance, and flavor. 
What color did it have? $It was like the color of fresh butter and mature butter. 
What flavor did $it have? It was like the flavor of honey balls. 
We ate this earth-fat and $remained in the world for a long time. 
$Those of us who ate much of the earth-fat came to be of ugly com￾plexion; those who ate little of the earth-fat came to be of beautiful com￾plexion. 
From then on we understood complexions as superior or inferior. 
$Because of our superior or inferior complexions, we despised one another, $saying, “My complexion is superior; your complexion is not equal to $it.” When, because of superiority and inferiority of complexion, arrogance $and evil mind states had arisen, the earth-fat disappeared. 
$After the earth-fat had disappeared, there arose for us a creeper that $had color, fragrance, and flavor. 
What color did it have? It was like the $color of the kadamba flower. 
What flavor did it have? It was like the $flavor of sticky honey balls. 
We ate the creeper and remained in the $world for a long time. 
$Those of us who ate much of the creeper came to be of ugly com￾plexion; those who ate little of the creeper came to be of beautiful com￾plexion. 
From then on we understood complexions as superior or infe￾rior. 
Because of our superior or inferior complexions, we despised one $another, saying, “My complexion is superior; your complexion is not $equal to it.” When, because of superiority and inferiority of complexion, $arrogance and evil mind states had arisen, the creeper disappeared. 
$After the creeper had disappeared, there arose for us natural non -$glutinous rice, which was white, clean, without husks, and without $stalks, four inches long. 
Harvested in the morning, it would be grown $[again] by the evening; harvested in the evening, it would be grown $[again] by the morning. 
It had a salty taste when cooked and did not $give rise to wind. 
We ate this natural nonglutinous rice. 
$Because we took the natural nonglutinous rice excessively and $stored it up, overnight the nonglutinous rice developed a skinlike husk. 
$241$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$242$Having been harvested for up to seven days it similarly developed a skin￾like husk, and the places where it had been harvested did not grow back. 
$What if we were now to create fields for sowing and set up boundary $markers? $Then the beings created fields for sowing and set up boundary markers. 
$Among them was one being who had their own rice, yet went into another’s $field to steal rice. 
On seeing this, the owner said, “Woe betide you! Woe $betide you, evil being! How can you do this? You have your own rice, yet $you go into another’s field to steal rice. 
Now go, and do not do this again!” $However, that being stole the other’s rice again, altogether three times. 
$Having seen this three times, the owner beat him with his fists and dragged $him before the community. 
He said to the community, “This being has $their own rice, yet goes into my field and steals my rice.” However, that $[accused] being also said to the community, “This being has beaten me $with his fists and dragged me before the community.”242$At this, all the beings came together with much crying and lamenting, $saying: $We have given rise to evil and unwholesome states through guarding $our fields. 
Why is that? Because we guard our fields, we quarrel with $one another, there is loss and depletion, there is altercation, and there $is beating with fists. 
Let us now select one among the community who $is upright, of fine appearance, very handsome, the foremost, to be lord $of the fields. 
Let him rebuke those who should be rebuked. 
Let him $expel those who should be expelled. 
From the rice that we have $obtained, we will deliver and donate to him [an amount] in accordance $with the Dharma. 
$Then the beings together selected one among them who was upright, of $fine appearance, very handsome, the foremost, and set him up as lord of $the fields. 
He was to rebuke those who should be rebuked and to expel $those who should be expelled. 
$From the rice they had, they delivered and donated to the lord of the $fields [an amount] in accordance with the Dharma. 
He was lord of the $“fields” (khetta) so they called him “warrior” (khattiya). 
He was empow￾ered according to the Dharma. 
One who pleases beings by guarding and ^taisho676a Division 12$protecting the practice of morality is a king. 
He was a king so they called $him “King.” Vāseṭṭha, this is the first cause and condition for the existence, $in the world, of the warrior class. 
This is ancient, primary knowledge, in $accordance with the Dharma, not contrary to the Dharma; and, being in $accordance with the Dharma, it is respected by the people. 
$Then certain other beings considered guarding [one’s fields] as a disease, $considered such guarding as a carbuncle, considered such guarding as an $arrow or a thorn. 
They gave up such guarding and relied on forest-dwelling, $constructing huts out of grass and leaves and trained in meditation. 
Each $morning at dawn they left the forest and entered a village or city or the $royal town to beg for almsfood. 
$Seeing them, many beings gave to them, respecting and esteeming $them and saying: $These other beings consider guarding [one’s fields] as a disease, consider $such guarding as a carbuncle, consider such guarding as an arrow or $a thorn. 
They have given up such guarding and rely on forest-dwelling, $constructing huts out of grass and leaves and training in meditation. 
$These venerable ones, having “abandoned” (bāhitvā) harming and evil $and unwholesome states, are “brahmins” (brāhmaṇa).243 $Being brahmins, they were called “brahmins.” Those beings who trained 676b in meditation but did not succeed in meditation, who trained in ascetic $practices but did not succeed in ascetic practices, who trained in seclusion $but did not succeed in seclusion, who trained in unification of the mind $but did not succeed in unification of the mind, who trained in being ener￾getic but did not succeed in being energetic, abandoned forest-dwelling $and returned to a village or city or the royal town.244 They constructed $houses with four pillars and composed sacred texts. 
$Many beings, on seeing this, no longer gave to them, no longer respected $and esteemed them, saying: $These other beings actually considered guarding [one’s fields] as a dis￾ease, considered such guarding as a carbuncle, considered such guarding $as an arrow or a thorn. 
They gave up such guarding and relied on for￾est-dwelling, constructing huts out of grass and leaves. 
They trained $in meditation but could not succeed in meditation, they trained in ascetic $243$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$practices but did not succeed in ascetic practices, they trained in seclu￾sion but did not succeed in seclusion, they trained in unification of the $mind but did not succeed in unification of the mind, they trained in $being energetic but did not succeed in being energetic. 
They have aban￾doned forest-dwelling and returned to a village or to a city or to the $royal town. 
They have constructed houses with four pillars and com￾posed sacred texts. 
These venerable ones train in wide learning; they $no longer train in meditation; they are learned. 
Being learned, they are $called “learned ones.” $Vāseṭṭha, this is the first cause and condition for the existence, in the $world, of the brahmin class. 
This is ancient, primary knowledge, in accor￾dance with the Dharma, not contrary to the Dharma; and, being in accor￾dance with the Dharma, it is respected by the people. 
$Then those other beings went to all regions to practice farming. 
They $were practicing farming in all regions. 
Practicing farming in all regions, $they were called merchants. 
Vāseṭṭha, this is the first cause and condition $for the existence, in the world, of the merchant class. 
This is ancient, primary $knowledge, in accordance with the Dharma, not contrary to the Dharma; $and, being in accordance with the Dharma, it is respected by the people. 
$Vāseṭṭha, when these three classes had arisen in the world, it became $known that there was a fourth class, the renunciants.245 How, when these $three classes had arisen in the world, did it become known that there was $a fourth class, the renunciants? $In a warrior clan, a clansman might censure himself for evil and $unwholesome states and, becoming disgusted with himself for his evil $and unwholesome states, shave off his hair and beard, don the yellow $robes, and out of faith leave the household life and become homeless to $train in the path. 
Thinking, “I shall become a renunciant and practice the $holy life,” he would become a renunciant and practice the holy life. 
$In the same way, in a brahmin clan or a merchant clan, a clansman $might similarly censure himself for evil and unwholesome states and, $being disgusted with himself for his evil and unwholesome states, shave $off his hair and beard, don the yellow robes, and out of faith leave the $household life and become homeless to train in the path. 
Thinking, “I $244$Division 12$shall become a renunciant and practice the holy life,” he would become $a renunciant and practice the holy life. 
Vāseṭṭha, in this way, when the $three classes had arisen in the world, it became known that there was a $fourth class, the renunciants. 
$Vāseṭṭha, I will now tell you in detail about these three classes. 
What, in $detail, are these three classes? A clansman of a warrior clan who does $unwholesome things with his body ...
with his speech ...
and does unwhole￾some things with his mind, will, at the breaking up of the body at death, cer￾tainly experience suffering. 
In the same way, a clansman of a brahmin clan $or of a merchant clan who does unwholesome things with his body ...
with $his speech ...
and does unwholesome things with his mind, will, at the $breaking up of the body at death, certainly experience suffering. 
$Vāseṭṭha, a clansman of a warrior clan who does wholesome things $with his body ...
with his speech ...
and does wholesome things with $his mind will, at the breaking up of the body at death, certainly experience $pleasure. 
In the same way, a clansman of a brahmin clan or a clansman $of a merchant clan who does wholesome things with his body ...
with $his speech ...
and does wholesome things with his mind will, at the break￾ing up of the body at death, certainly experience pleasure. 
$Vāseṭṭha, a clansman of a warrior clan who does both [wholesome and $unwholesome] things with his body while practicing restraint ...
with $his speech ...
and does both [wholesome and unwholesome] things with $his mind while practicing restraint will, at the breaking up of the body at $death, experience suffering and pleasure. 
In the same way a clansman of $a brahmin clan or of a merchant clan who does both [wholesome and $unwholesome] things with his body while practicing restraint ...
with $his speech ...
and does both [wholesome and unwholesome] things with $his mind while practicing restraint will, at the breaking up of the body at $death, experience [both] suffering and pleasure. 
$Vāseṭṭha, a clansman of a warrior clan cultivates the seven factors of $awakening, attends to them well and contemplates them well. 
Knowing $like this and seeing like this, his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual $desire ...
from the taint of existence ...
his mind is liberated from the $taint of ignorance. 
It being liberated, he knows it is liberated, knowing as $it really is: “Birth has been ended, the holy life has been established, what $245^taisho676c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$had to be done has been done. 
There will not be another experiencing of $existence.” $In the same way a clansman of a brahmin clan or of a merchant clan cul￾tivates the seven factors of awakening, attends to them well and contemplates $them well. 
Knowing like this and seeing like this, his mind is liberated from $the taint of sensual desire ...
from the taint of existence ...
his mind is lib￾erated from the taint of ignorance. 
It being liberated, he knows it is lib￾erated, knowing as it really is: “Birth has been ended, the holy life has $been established, what had to be done has been done; there will not be $another experiencing of existence.” $Vāseṭṭha, in this way I have analyzed these three classes in detail. 
$Brahmā, the lord of heaven, has spoken this stanza: $The warrior is esteemed among two-footed [beings], $That is, those possessing class and clan. 
$[But] those who seek to train in knowledge and conduct $Are praised by devas and human beings. 
$Vāseṭṭha, the lord of heaven, Brahmā, said this stanza well, not badly. 
He $intoned and chanted it well, not badly. 
He proclaimed it well, not badly—$that is, saying this: $The warrior is esteemed among two-footed [beings], $That is, those possessing class and clan. 
$[But] those who seek to train in knowledge and conduct $Are praised by devas and human beings. 
$Why is that? I similarly say this, $The warrior is esteemed among two-footed [beings], $That is, those possessing class and clan. 
$[But] those who seek to train in knowledge and conduct $Are praised by devas and men. 
$Thus said the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, Venerable $Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja and the [other] monks were delighted and received $it respectfully.

^ck The Discourse about Velāma246$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the householder Sudatta approached the Buddha,247 paid hom￾age with his head, stepped back, and sat to one side. 
$The World-honored One asked him, “Householder, does your family prac￾tice almsgiving?” $The householder Sudatta replied: $Yes indeed, World-honored One. 
My family practices almsgiving, but we $are unable to [give] what is excellent. 
[What we give as almsfood] is very $coarse, just rice bran with husks, sesame soup, and a slice of ginger. 
$The World-honored One said: $Householder, whether one gives coarse food or gives excellent food, both $bring their results indeed. 
Householder, if one gives what is coarse and $gives without faith, gives without deliberation, gives but not with one’s $own hands, gives without going in person, gives without due consideration, $gives without sincerity, gives without contemplating the fruits and results $of one’s actions, then one should contemplate receiving the following kinds $of results: One’s mind will not enjoy getting an excellent house; it will not $enjoy getting an excellent chariot; it will not enjoy getting excellent clothing; $it will not enjoy getting excellent food and drink; it will not enjoy getting $whatever is excellent by way of the five strands of sensuality.248$Why is that? Because one is practicing giving without sincerity. 
House￾holder, one should understand that one will receive these kinds of results. 
$Householder, if one gives what is coarse but gives with faith, gives with $deliberation, gives with one’s own hands, gives having gone in person, $gives with due consideration, gives with sincerity, gives having contemplated $the fruits and results of one’s actions, then one should contemplate receiving $the following kinds of results: One’s mind will enjoy getting an excellent $house; it will enjoy getting an excellent chariot; it will enjoy getting excellent $clothes; it will enjoy getting excellent food and drink; it will enjoy getting $whatever is excellent by way of the five strands of sensuality.

^ck The Discourse to the $Pārāyana Brahmins255$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time a group of brahmins from the Kosala country, who were $taking an afternoon walk, approached the Buddha. 
Having exchanged polite $greetings, they stepped back, sat to one side, and said, “Gotama, we would $like to ask a question. 
Will you listen to our question?” $The World-honored One said, “Feel free to ask.” $Then the brahmins asked, “Gotama, are brahmins now practicing the Dharma $of former brahmins or are they transgressing the Dharma of former brahmins?” 678b$The World-honored One replied: $There are no brahmins now who practice the Dharma of former brahmins. 
$For a long time brahmins have been transgressing the Dharma of former $brahmins. 
$251$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Then the brahmins asked: $Gotama, why are no brahmins now practicing the Dharma of former brah￾mins? Since when have brahmins been transgressing the Dharma of former $brahmins? $Then the World-honored One said these stanzas:256$In so-called ancient times there were those $Who were self-restrained and intent on their practice. 
$Relinquishing the five strands of sensuality, $They practiced the pure holy life. 
$Practicing celibacy and morality $Led them to become soft and tender by nature. 
$Their minds shone with forgiveness and harmlessness. 
$Patient and forbearing, they guarded their thoughts. 
$In ancient times this was the Dharma, $Which [present-day] brahmins have not preserved. 
$[In ancient times] brahmins did not keep watch over $Wealth or grain as their possessions. 
$Chanting [of hymns] was their wealth and grain; $This was the treasure that brahmins guarded, $[Rather than] variously colored garments, $Houses, beds, and couches. 
$[In] prosperous cities and in all countries $[The ancient] brahmins trained like this. 
$These brahmins did no harm; $They led the way in protecting all things. 
$When they went to others’ doors, $No one turned them away. 
$[People] opened their homes [to them] $When mealtime came and they went begging.257$When brahmins were at home, $Visitors wished to make offerings to them. 
$252$Division 12$253$For fully forty-eight years $They practiced pure celibacy. 
$Seeking accomplishment in knowledge and conduct $Was the practice of brahmins in ancient times. 
$They did not steal [others’] wealth $And they had nothing to fear. 
$If mutual affection matched up, $Then it was proper for them to cohabit, $[But] not out of annoyance $Or resentment toward sexual customs. 
$Not all brahmins $Were capable of practicing like this. 
$If there were some of outstanding practice, $Brahmins extremely firm in their quest, $Then they, as regards sexual matters, $Did not engage in them even in their dreams. 
$Because of this practice of celibacy $They called themselves brahmins [saying], “I am a brahmin.” $Knowing they had this conduct, $The wise always recognized them $As using thin beds and simple clothes $And surviving on ghee and milk as food. 
$Begging was always done according to the Dharma $During a sacrifice and in the ritual of giving. 
$During a sacrifice they did not have others beg for them, $But begged for themselves. 
$When making offerings at a sacrifice, $They did not kill cows, $Which are like one’s parents or brothers $Or one’s other relatives. 
$Cows are also like human beings. 
$The reason they give rise to happiness ^taisho678c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Are the food and drink [they provide, which gives us] bodily strength; $As a means of conveyance [they provide] ease and happiness. 
$Understanding this principle, $They did not delight in killing cows, $Whose soft bodies are so large, $With a refined appearance that is renowned. 
$Eagerly seeking their own benefit, $The brahmins of ancient times pursued their practice. 
$For their own benefit brahmins $Engaged in [some] affairs and abstained from [other] affairs. 
$They had to come into this world, $Yet they were committed to liberation from this world. 
$[However] as month succeeded month, $Their minds were seen to incline toward that [worldliness]. 
$They enjoyed themselves at night $With finely adorned women. 
$They were surrounded by auspicious cows $[But also by] very handsome women. 
$The subtle sensual pleasures of society $[Became] for brahmins a constant source of longing. 
$Possession of chariots $Well-made and finely finished, $Household life, and marriage $[Became] for brahmins a constant source of longing. 
$Having created this bond, [they thought,] $“Come, let us pursue that!” $[They then approached the king and said,] $“Great king, perform a sacrifice and practice giving! $Do not miss [this opportunity] to profit from your wealth, $From your abundant property and grain. 
$“If you have surplus [wealth] and cows, $Great king, it is appropriate [to expend it on] this: $254$Division 12$255$On brahmins and chariots $For an elephant sacrifice, a horse sacrifice, $And a cow sacrifice.258 Do not guard the gates [of your stables]. 
$“Gather crowds and perform a sacrificial giving, $With wealth as gifts to brahmins. 
$From this you will gain profit, $Beloved and cherished wealth!” $Thus they aroused [the king’s] desire, $Increasing his craving more and more $For wealth immeasurable $Like water in a vast reservoir. 
$[They thought,] “Men who own cows are in this way $Provided with their livelihood.” $They created this bondage [with the thought], $“Come, let us pursue that!” $[They approached the king again and said,] $“Great king, perform a sacrifice and practice giving! $Do not miss [this opportunity] to profit from your wealth, $From your abundant property and grain. 
$“If you have surplus wealth, $Great king, it is appropriate [to expend it on] this: $On brahmins and chariots $And countless hundreds and thousands of cows $To be killed in a sacrifice.” $The horns on their heads disturbed no one; $The cows of ancient times were [harmless] as pigs. 
$Going and seizing them by the horns $[Brahmins] took sharp knives and killed the cows. 
$“Cows are just like our fathers!” $Exclaimed a spirit named Fragrance. 
$He cried, “This is against the Dharma!” $As they stabbed the cows with knives. 
^taisho679a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$256$This custom of undertaking sacrifices $Was the principal transgression. 
$There is no reason to kill. 
$Stay far away from this decadent custom! $In ancient times there were three diseases: $Desire, lack of food, and old age.259$Through hatred of cows $Diseases increased to ninety-eight. 
$Such [behavior] caused quarrels to grow, $And therefore was disliked by the wise. 
$If people saw such [behavior], $Who did not dislike it? $Such behavior in this world $Lacked wisdom; it was the lowest. 
$Everyone had desire and hatred. 
$Wives even slandered their husbands. 
$Some women of the warrior and brahmin classes, $Although guarded by their clans, $Violating their birth customs, $Became unrestrained in sensual pleasures. 
$Thus, brahmins, brahmins now are not practicing the Dharma of former $brahmins. 
For a long time brahmins have been transgressing the Dharma $of former brahmins. 
$Then the group of brahmins from Kosala country said: $World-honored One, we have understood. 
Well-gone One, we have com￾prehended.260 World-honored One, from now on we go for refuge to the $Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha of monks. 
May the World-honored $One accept us as lay disciples from this day forth until the end of life, as $having personally gone for refuge for our whole life. 
$Thus said the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the group of $brahmins from the Kosala country and the monks were delighted and received $it respectfully.

^ck The Discourse in the $Yellow Reed Park261$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Verañjā in the 679b$Yellow Reed Park. 
$At that time a brahmin of Verañjā, who was very old, whose life span was $almost over, whose life was on the verge of coming to an end, a hundred and $twenty years [of age], walking with the support of a staff, while roaming $around in the afternoon, approached the Buddha and exchanged polite greet￾ings. 
Standing before the Buddha supported by his staff, he said: $Gotama, I have heard that the renunciant Gotama, who is very young and $has just gone forth to train [in the path], on being personally approached $by famous and virtuous renunciants and brahmins, does not show respect $for them, does not revere them, does not get up from his seat, and does $not invite them to be seated. 
Gotama, this is very improper. 
$The World-honored One said: $Brahmin, I have never seen anyone, among devas and māras, Brahmās, $renunciants, brahmins, from human beings to devas who, on approaching $me could expect me, the Tathāgata, to show respect and reverence for $them, to get up from my seat and invite them to be seated. 
Brahmin, if $someone were to approach me, the Tathāgata, desiring that I should show $respect and reverence, get up from my seat, and invite them to be seated, $then that person’s head would certainly split into seven pieces. 
$The brahmin said, “Gotama lacks taste.” $The World-honored One said: $Brahmin, there is a way in which I do lack taste, though it is not what you $are referring to. 
Whatever there is of taste in forms, taste in sounds, taste $in fragrances, [taste in flavors,]262 taste in tangibles, the Tathāgata has $eradicated it through wisdom, brought it to cessation, uprooted it so that $it can never arise again. 
This is a way in which I lack taste, though it is $not what you are referring to. 
$The brahmin said again, “Gotama is without fear.”263$257$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$258$The World-honored One said: $Brahmin, there is a way in which I am without fear, though it is not what $you are referring to. 
Whatever is fearsome in forms, fearsome in sounds, $fearsome in odors, fearsome in flavors, fearsome in tangibles, the Tathāgata $has eradicated it through wisdom, brought it to cessation, uprooted it so $that it can never arise again. 
This is a way in which I am without fear, $though it is not what you are referring to. 
$The brahmin said again, “Gotama does not enter a womb.” $The World-honored One said: $Brahmin, there is a way in which I do not enter a womb, though it is not $what you are referring to. 
If there is some renunciant or brahmin who has, $through wisdom, eradicated future coming to a womb, brought it to cessation, $uprooted it so that he will never take birth again, then of him I say that he $does not enter a womb. 
The Tathāgata has, through wisdom, eradicated future $coming to a womb, brought it to cessation, uprooted it so that he will never $take birth again. 
For this reason I will not enter a womb. 
This is a way in $which I do not enter a womb, though it is not what you are referring to. 
$Brahmin, among these living beings who have come from ignorance, $delight in ignorance, are covered by ignorance, are trapped in the eggshell $of ignorance, I am the first to have insight into the Dharma. 
I am foremost $among living beings. 
$It is just like a hen that has laid ten or twelve eggs and is mindful of $them at the proper time, shelters them at the proper time, warms them at $the proper time, sustains them at the proper time. 
Later on, [even if] the $hen may have left them alone [at that time], one of the chicks pecks through $its shell with its beak or claws and emerges safely. 
That one is foremost $among the chicks. 
$I am like this. 
Of these living beings who have come from ignorance, $delight in ignorance, are covered by ignorance, are trapped in the eggshell $of ignorance, I am the first to have insight into the Dharma, I am foremost $among living beings. 
$Brahmin, taking mugwort grass, I went to the tree of awakening, $spread the grass beneath the tree, placed my sitting mat on it, and sat ^taisho679c Division 12$down cross-legged [with this resolve]: “I will not break this upright sitting $posture until the taints have been destroyed.” And I did not break that $upright sitting posture until the taints had been destroyed.264$Sitting upright, secluded from sensual desires, secluded from evil and $unwholesome states, I attained and dwelt in the first absorption, which is $with [directed] awareness and [sustained] contemplation, with rapture $and happiness born of seclusion. 
At that time this was the first higher state $of mind that I reached, attaining a pleasant abiding in the present, attaining $it easily and without difficulty, a pleasant dwelling without fear, peaceful $and delightful, which leads to nirvana. 
$Again, brahmin, with the calming of [directed] awareness and [sus￾tained] contemplation, with inner stillness and mental unification, I attained $and dwelt in the second absorption, which is without [directed] awareness $and [sustained] contemplation, and with rapture and happiness born of $concentration. 
At that time this was the second higher state of mind that $I reached, attaining a pleasant abiding in the present, attaining it easily $and without difficulty, a pleasant dwelling without fear, peaceful and $delightful, which leads to nirvana. 
$Again, brahmin, secluded from rapture and pleasure, dwelling in equa￾nimity and without seeking anything, with right mindfulness and right $comprehension, experiencing happiness with the body, I attained and $dwelt in the third absorption, which the noble ones speak of as noble equa￾nimity and mindfulness, a happy abode. 
At that time this was the third $higher state of mind that I reached, attaining a pleasant abiding in the $present, attaining it easily and without difficulty, a pleasant dwelling $without fear, peaceful and delightful, which leads to nirvana. 
$Again, brahmin, with the cessation of pleasure and the cessation of $pain, and with the earlier cessation of joy and displeasure, with neither￾pain-nor-pleasure, and with purity of mindfulness and equanimity, I attained $and dwelt in the fourth absorption. 
At that time this was the fourth higher $state of mind that I reached, attaining a pleasant abiding in the present, $attaining it easily and without difficulty, a pleasant dwelling without fear, $peaceful and delightful, which leads to nirvana. 
$Again, brahmin, with my mind concentrated and purified in this way, $without defilement, without affliction, malleable, well steadied, having 680a$259$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$gained mental imperturbability, I trained in the realization of the higher $knowledge of the recollection of former lives. 
I recalled countless former $lives traversed by me in the past, together with my activities and my out￾ward appearance [in those lives]: one birth, two births, a hundred births, $a thousand births, eons of [world] expansion, eons of [world] contraction, $countless eons of [world] expansion and contraction. 
$[I recalled:] “I was that living being named So-and-so. 
[I] went through $those past experiences; I was [once] born there, with this family name $and this given name; I had this type of life and this type of food and drink, $experiencing this type of pleasure and pain; my life span was like this, I $survived this long, and my life ended like this. 
Dying here, I was reborn $there; dying there, I was reborn here. 
I was reborn here with this family $name and this given name; I had this type of life and this type of food and $drink, experiencing this type of pleasure and pain; my life span was like $this, I survived this long, and my life ended like this.” $This was the first higher knowledge that I attained at that time in the $first watch of the night, having formerly been without negligence, having $delighted in being established in seclusion, and having energetically cul￾tivated it. 
$Thus lack of wisdom was eradicated and wisdom arose, darkness was $destroyed and knowledge accomplished, ignorance was eradicated and $knowledge arose, namely by realizing the higher knowledge of recollecting $past lives. 
$Again, brahmin, with my mind concentrated and purified in this way, $without defilement, without affliction, malleable, well steadied, having $gained mental imperturbability, I trained in the realization of the higher $knowledge of the death and rebirth [of beings]. 
$With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human [eye], $I saw beings as they die and as they are reborn, handsome or ugly, superior $or inferior, as they come and go between good and bad realms of existence, $in accordance with the [previous] deeds of these living beings. 
$I saw as it really is that, if these living beings have undertaken evil $bodily conduct, evil verbal and mental conduct, if they have reviled noble $ones, held wrong views, and undertaken actions [based on] wrong views, $then because of these causes and conditions, at the breaking up of the $260$Division 12$body after death they certainly go to a bad realm of existence, being reborn $in hell. 
$If [however], these living beings have undertaken sublime bodily con￾duct, sublime verbal and mental conduct, if they have not reviled noble $ones, have held right views, and undertaken actions [based on] right views, $then because of these causes and conditions, at the breaking up of the $body after death they certainly go to a good realm of existence, being $reborn in a heavenly realm. 
$This was the second higher knowledge that I attained at that time in $the middle watch of the night, by having formerly been without negligence, $having delighted in being established in seclusion, and having energetically $cultivated it. 
$Thus lack of wisdom was eradicated and wisdom arose, darkness was $destroyed and knowledge accomplished, ignorance was eradicated and $knowledge arose, namely by realizing the higher knowledge of the death $and rebirth [of beings]. 
$Again, brahmin, with my mind concentrated and purified in this way, $without defilement, without affliction, malleable, well steadied, having $gained mental imperturbability, I trained in the realization of the higher $knowledge of the destruction of the taints. 
$I knew as it really is: “This is dukkha.” I knew [as it really is]: “This $is the arising of dukkha.” I knew [as it really is]: “This is the cessation of $dukkha.” I knew as it really is: “This is the path to the cessation of dukkha.” $I knew as it really is: “These are the taints.” I knew [as it really is]: $“This is the arising of the taints.” I knew [as it really is]: “This is the ces￾sation of the taints.” I knew as it really is: “This is the path to the cessation $of the taints.” $Knowing like this, seeing like this, my mind was liberated from the $taint of sensual desire ...
from the taint of existence, my mind was liberated $from the taint of ignorance. 
It being liberated, I knew it was liberated, $knowing as it really is: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, $what had to be done has been done; there will not be another experiencing $of existence.” $This was the third higher knowledge that I attained at that time in the $last watch of the night, having formerly been without negligence, having $261^taisho680b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$delighted in being established in seclusion, and having energetically cul￾tivated it. 
$Thus lack of wisdom was eradicated and wisdom arose, darkness was $destroyed and knowledge accomplished, ignorance was eradicated and $knowledge arose, namely by realizing the higher knowledge of the destruc￾tion of the taints. 
$Again, brahmin, if there is someone of whom it could rightly be said $that he teaches to living beings that have arisen in the world a Dharma $that is free from delusion, who is foremost among all living beings, who $is not covered up by pain and pleasure, then you should know that it can $rightly be said of me. 
Why is that? [It is because] I teach to living beings $who have arisen in the world a Dharma that is free from delusion. 
I am $foremost among all living beings. 
I am not covered up by pain and $pleasure.265$Then the brahmin of Verañjā put aside his staff, paid homage with his $head at the Buddha’s feet, and said to the World-honored One: $The World-honored One is foremost, the World-honored One is great, the $World-honored One is superior, the World-honored One is supreme, the $World-honored One has rank, the World-honored One is without equal, $the World-honored One is incomparable, the World-honored One is without $obstructions, the World-honored One is a person without obstructions.266$World-honored One, from now on I go for refuge to the Buddha, the $Dharma, and the Sangha of monks. 
May the World-honored One accept $me as a lay disciple from this day forth until the end of life, as having $personally gone for refuge for my whole life.267$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the brahmin $of Verañjā and the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.

^ck The Discourse to Doṇa268$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the brahmin Doṇa, while roaming around in the afternoon, $approached the Buddha, exchanged polite greetings, stepped back, and sat to $262$Division 12$one side. 
The World-honored One asked him,269 “Doṇa, if someone asks you $if you are a brahmin, do you say you are a brahmin and call yourself one?” $The brahmin Doṇa replied: $Gotama, one can rightly call himself a brahmin if he is born of parents $who are of pure descent, if for seven generations on both his father’s and $his mother’s sides there has been uninterrupted continuity of births without $blemish; and if he has learned much and retained it, is able to recite it, $and is a master of the four Vedas with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, $and etymology, and the histories as a fifth.270$Gotama, one who can rightly call himself a brahmin is myself. 
Why 680c is that? I am born of parents of pure descent; for seven generations on $both my father’s and my mother’s sides there has been uninterrupted con￾tinuity of births without blemish; and I have learned much and retained $it, am able to recite it, and am a master of the four Vedas with their vocab￾ularies, liturgy, phonology, and etymology, and the histories as a fifth. 
$The World-honored One said: $Doṇa, I will now ask you [a question]; answer according to your under￾standing. 
Doṇa, what do you think? Those ancient brahmins who have $died and passed away, reciters of the sacred texts, who promulgated the $sacred texts and recited the Vedas—namely, Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, $Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgīrasa, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, Bhāradvāja, and $Bhagu—they have designated five types of brahmins: $There are brahmins who are like Brahmā, there are brahmins who are $like a deva, there are brahmins who do not overstep the boundaries, there $are brahmins who overstep the boundaries, and there are brahmins who $are outcastes as the fifth. 
Doṇa, of these five types of brahmins, which $one are you? $Doṇa said: $Gotama has spoken about this matter in brief, without explaining its details. 
$I am unable to understand it. 
May the renunciant Gotama explain it well $so that I understand its meaning. 
$263$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$The World-honored One said, “Doṇa, listen closely and pay proper atten￾tion, I will analyze it for you in detail.” $Doṇa said, “Indeed, Gotama.” The brahmin Doṇa listened to receive the $instruction. 
$The Buddha said: $Doṇa, how is a brahmin like Brahmā? A brahmin is born of parents of pure $descent; for seven generations on both his father’s and his mother’s sides $there has been uninterrupted continuity of births without blemish. 
For $forty-eight years he practices the holy life as a young man, wishing to $acquire the sacred texts, to recite the canonical texts. 
Having acquired the $sacred texts, recited the canonical texts, he supports his teacher by begging $for wealth in accordance with the Dharma, not contrary to the Dharma. 
$What is “[in accordance with the Dharma, not] contrary to the Dharma”? $[It is] not by farming, not by trade, not by [compiling] books, not by cal￾culating, not by accounting, not by engraving, not by handwriting, not by $composing regulations, not by [compiling] discourses, not by poetry, not $by wielding sword or staff, not by attending to the king’s affairs, [but] by $begging in accordance with the Dharma, he begs for wealth to support $his teacher.271$Having offered wealth [to his teacher],272 with a mind imbued with $loving-kindness, he dwells [mentally] pervading one direction, likewise $the second, the third, and the fourth direction, and also the four intermediate $directions and above and below, all around, everywhere. 
With a mind $imbued with loving-kindness, free of fetters or resentment, without ill will $or contention, he dwells pervading the entire world [with a mind that is] $boundless, exalted, immeasurable, and well-cultivated. 
In the same way, $with a mind imbued with compassion ...
with empathic joy ...
with equa￾nimity, free of fetters or resentment, without ill will or conflict, he dwells $pervading the entire world [with a mind that is] boundless, exalted, immeas￾urable, and well-cultivated. 
Doṇa, in this way a brahmin is like Brahmā. 
$Doṇa, how is a brahmin like a deva? A brahmin is born of parents of $pure descent; for seven generations on both his father’s and his mother’s $sides there has been uninterrupted continuity of births without blemish.

$Having offered wealth [to his teacher], he practices sublime bodily $conduct ...
verbal ...
sublime mental conduct. 
Having practiced sublime $bodily conduct ...
verbal ...
sublime mental conduct, at the destruction $of the body at death he will certainly go to a good realm of existence, $being reborn in heaven.273 Doṇa, in this way a brahmin is like the devas. 
$Doṇa, how does a brahmin not overstep the boundaries? A brahmin is $born of parents of pure descent; for seven generations on both his father’s $and his mother’s sides there has been uninterrupted continuity of births $without blemish.

$Having offered wealth [to his teacher], he seeks a wife for himself in $accordance with the Dharma, not contrary to the Dharma. 
What is “[in $accordance with the Dharma, not] contrary to the Dharma”? A brahmin $does not approach a brahmin woman with intentions such as these: to $increase mutual craving and to have [sexual] union. 
He approaches a brah￾min woman, not a nonbrahmin woman, nor a warrior woman, nor one $who is pregnant, nor one who is nursing. 
$265$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$266$Doṇa, for what reason does a brahmin not approach [a woman] who $is pregnant? So that this man and woman will not become known as impure $and licentious.274 For this reason a brahmin does not approach [a woman] $who is pregnant. 
Doṇa, for what reason does a brahmin not approach [a $woman] who is nursing? So that this man and woman will not become $known as impure and angry.

$Doṇa, he approaches [a woman] not for the sake of wealth, nor for the $sake of pride, nor for the sake of adornment, nor for the sake of decoration, $but just for the sake of a son.

^ck The Discourse on Araka279$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time, after the midday meal, the monks were sitting together in $the assembly hall discussing this matter: $Venerable friends, it is extraordinary. 
It is extraordinary how very short $is human life, [after which] one has to pass on to the next life. 
One should $do what is wholesome, one should practice the holy life, for whoever is $born will die. 
Yet, as regards practice of the Dharma, practice that is ben￾eficial, practice that is wholesome, practice that is sublime, people in this $present life do not act and strive [accordingly]. 
$At that time the World-honored One was passing the day’s abiding else￾where. 
With the purified divine ear, which surpasses the human [ear], he $heard those monks sitting together in the assembly hall after the midday meal $discussing this matter: $Venerable friends, it is extraordinary. 
It is extraordinary how very short $is human life, [after which] one has to pass on to the next life. 
One should $271^taisho682b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$272$do what is wholesome, one should practice the holy life, for whoever is $born will die. 
Yet, as regards practice of the Dharma, practice that is ben￾eficial, practice that is wholesome, practice that is sublime, people in this $present life do not act and strive [accordingly]. 
$Having heard this, in the late afternoon the World-honored One rose from $sitting in meditation and approached the assembly hall. 
He sat down on a $seat prepared in front of the assembly of monks and asked the monks, “What $matter were you discussing? For what purpose have you come to sit together $in the assembly hall?” $Then the monks said: $World-honored One, we monks assembled and, being seated together in $the assembly hall after the midday meal, were discussing this matter: $“Venerable friends, it is extraordinary. 
It is extraordinary how very short $is human life, [after which] one has to pass on to the next life.

Yet, as regards practice of the Dharma, practice that is ben￾eficial, practice that is wholesome, practice that is sublime, people in this $present life do not act and strive [accordingly].” World-honored One, this $is the matter we have been discussing. 
It is for this reason that we are $seated together in the assembly hall. 
$The World-honored One exclaimed: $It is well, it is well, monks, that you were talking like this: “Venerable $friends, it is extraordinary. 
It is extraordinary how very short is human $life, [after which] one has to pass on to the next life. 
One should do what $is wholesome; one should practice the holy life, for whoever is born will $die. 
Yet, as regards practice of the Dharma, practice that is beneficial, $practice that is wholesome, practice that is sublime, people in this present $life do not act and strive [accordingly].” Why is that? I too say this: “It $is extraordinary. 
It is extraordinary how very short is human life, [after $which] one has to pass on to the next life. 
One should do what is whole￾some, one should practice the holy life, for whoever is born will die. 
Yet, $as regards practice of the Dharma, practice that is beneficial, practice that ^taisho682c Division 12$is wholesome, practice that is sublime, people in this present life do not $act and strive [accordingly].” $Why is that? In former times, in the past, the life span of living beings $was eighty thousand years. 
Monks, when the human life span was eighty $thousand years, this Jambudīpa was flourishing greatly and delightful, $with plenty of wealth and treasures, and with villages and towns close $together, only a chicken’s flight apart. 
$Monks, when the human life span was eighty thousand years, women $were marriageable at five hundred years of age. 
Monks, when the human $life span was eighty thousand years, the only diseases that existed were $these: cold, heat, the need to urinate and defecate, sensual desire, hunger, $and old age. 
There were no other afflictions. 
$Monks, when the human life span was eighty thousand years, there $was a king named Koravya, who was a wheel-turning monarch, intelligent $and wise. 
Equipped with a fourfold army, he reigned over the entire world, $freely, as he liked. 
Being a righteous Dharma king, he had attained the $seven treasures. 
Those seven treasures are: the wheel treasure, the elephant $treasure, the horse treasure, the jewel treasure, the woman treasure, the $steward treasure, and the counselor treasure—these are the seven. 
He had $a thousand sons, handsome, brave, fearless, and able to overcome the $troops of others. 
He certainly ruled over the whole earth, as far as the $ocean, without relying on sword or club, just by teaching the Dharma, $bringing peace and happiness. 
$Monks, King Koravya had a brahmin named Araka, a great elder, who $was born of parents of pure descent. 
For seven generations on both his $father’s and his mother’s sides there had been uninterrupted continuity $of births without blemish. 
He had learned much and retained it, and was $able to recite it. 
He was a master of the four Vedas with their vocabularies, $liturgy, phonology, and etymology, and the histories as a fifth. 
$Monks, the brahmin Araka had countless hundreds and thousands of $young brahmin students. 
Dwelling in a secluded place, the brahmin Araka $taught the sacred texts to his countless hundreds and thousands of young $brahmin students. 
$At that time the brahmin Araka, dwelling alone in a secluded place, $sat in meditation and reflection. 
He had this thought in his mind: “It is $273$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$274$extraordinary. 
It is extraordinary how very short is human life, [after $which] one has to pass on to the next life. 
One should do what is whole￾some; one should practice the holy life, for whoever is born will die. 
Yet, $as regards practice of the Dharma, practice that is beneficial, practice that $is wholesome, practice that is sublime, people in this present life do not $act and strive [accordingly]. 
Let me now shave off hair and beard, don $the yellow robes and, out of faith, go forth from the household life to train $in the path.” $Then the brahmin Araka approached his group of many young brahmin $students from various countries and said, “Young brahmin students, while $dwelling alone in a secluded place, I sat in meditation and reflection. 
I had $this thought in my mind: ‘It is extraordinary.

What will you do?” $The group of many young brahmin students from various countries $said, “Venerable teacher, whatever we know, we have received it all $through the teacher’s kindness. 
If the venerable teacher shaves off hair $and beard, dons the yellow robes, and, out of faith, goes forth from the $household life to train in the path, then we too will shave off hair and $beard, don the yellow robes, and, out of faith, go forth from the household $life to train in the path under our venerable teacher.” $Then at a later time the brahmin Araka shaved off hair and beard, donned $the yellow robes, and, out of faith, went forth from the household life to $train in the path; and the group of many young brahmin students from $various countries also shaved off hair and beard, donned the yellow robes, $and, out of faith, went forth from the household life to train in the path under $their venerable teacher. 
Thus arose the designations “the venerable teacher $Araka” and “the disciples of the venerable teacher Araka.” ^taisho683a Division 12$At that time the venerable teacher Araka taught his disciples the $Dharma:280 “Brahmin students, it is extraordinary.

$Again, the venerable teacher Araka taught his disciples the Dharma: $“Brahmin students, with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, I dwell [men￾tally] pervading one direction, likewise the second, the third, and the fourth $direction, and also the four intermediate directions and above and below, all $around, everywhere.

$Again, the venerable teacher Araka explained to his disciples the teach￾ing of the Brahmā realm. 
When the venerable teacher Araka explained $the teaching of the Brahmā realm, there were some of the disciples who $278^taisho684a Division 12$did not completely accept the teaching. 
After death they were reborn $among the Four Heavenly Kings, or they were reborn among the devas $of the Thirty-three, or they were reborn among the Yāma devas, or they $were reborn among the Tusita devas, or they were reborn among the devas $who Delight in Creating, or they were reborn among the devas who Wield $Power over Others’ Creations. 
When the venerable teacher Araka explained $the teaching of the Brahmā realm, there were some of the disciples who $completely accepted the teaching. 
Cultivating the four divine abodes $(brahmavihāras) and separating themselves from sensual desires, after $death they were reborn among the Brahmā devas. 
$At that time the venerable teacher Araka thought, “It is not appropriate $for me to be equal to my disciples, being reborn together with them in the $next life in one place. 
Let me now further cultivate a superior loving-kind￾ness. 
Having further cultivated a superior loving-kindness, after death I $will be reborn among the Ābhassara devas.” At a later time the venerable $teacher Araka further cultivated a superior loving-kindness. 
Having further $cultivated a superior loving-kindness, after death he was reborn among $the Ābhassara devas. 
The path in which the venerable teacher Araka and $his disciples trained was not vain. 
They attained great fruit. 
$Monks, what do you think? Was the venerable teacher Araka of ancient $times someone else? Do not think this. 
Why is that? Monks, you should $know that he was myself. 
At that time I was called “the venerable teacher $Araka.” At that time I had countless hundreds and thousands of disciples. 
$At that time I explained to my disciples the teaching about the Brahmā realm. 
$When I explained the teaching about the Brahmā realm, some of my 684b disciples did not fully accept the teaching, and after death they were reborn $among the Four Heavenly Kings, or they were reborn among the devas $of the Thirty-three, or they were reborn among the Yāma devas, or they $were reborn among the Tusita devas, or they were reborn among the devas $who Delight in Creating, or they were reborn among the devas who Wield $Power over Others’ Creations. 
When I explained the teaching about the $Brahmā realm, some of my disciples completely accepted the teaching. 
$Cultivating the four divine abodes and separating themselves from sensual $desires, after death they were reborn among the Brahmā devas. 
$At that time I thought, “It is not appropriate for me to be equal to my $279$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$disciples, being reborn together with them in one place in the next life. 
$Let me now further cultivate a superior loving-kindness. 
Having further $cultivated a superior loving-kindness, after death I will be reborn among $the Ābhassara devas.” At a later time I further cultivated a superior lov￾ing-kindness. 
Having cultivated a superior loving-kindness, after death I $was reborn among the Ābhassara devas. 
The path in which I and my dis￾ciples trained at that time was not vain. 
We attained great fruit. 
$At that time I benefited myself, benefited others, benefited many people. 
$I had compassion for the whole world and I sought prosperity, benefit, peace, $and happiness for devas and human beings. 
[However,] the teaching that I $taught at that time did not reach fulfillment, it did not fulfill purification, it $did not fulfill the holy life. 
Not having fulfilled the holy life, at that time I $did not become free from birth, aging, disease, death, sorrow, and distress, $and I was not yet able to attain liberation from all dukkha.$Monks, I have now appeared in this world as a tathāgata, free from $attachment, fully awakened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, a $well-gone one, a knower of the world, an unsurpassable person, a leader $on the path of Dharma, a teacher of devas and human beings, called a $buddha, an exalted one. 
I now benefit myself, benefit others, benefit many $people. 
I have compassion for the whole world and I seek prosperity, ben￾efit, peace, and happiness for devas and human beings. 
I now teach the $Dharma, having reached fulfillment, having fulfilled purification, having $fulfilled the holy life. 
Having completely fulfilled the holy life, I am now $free from birth, aging, disease, death, sorrow, and distress. 
I have now $attained liberation from all dukkha.$Monks, “Very short is human life, [after which] one has to pass on to $the next life. 
One should do what is wholesome, one should practice the $holy life, for whoever is born will die.” Monks, this is rightly spoken now. 
$Why is that? Because the [human] life span now extends to only a hundred $years, or perhaps a little more. 
$One who has such a life span lives for three hundred seasons—a hun￾dred springs, a hundred summers, and a hundred winters. 
He lives for $one thousand two hundred months—four hundred months of spring, four $hundred months of summer, and four hundred months of winter—so he $lives for one thousand two hundred months. 
$280$Division 12$He lives for two thousand four hundred fortnights—eight hundred fort￾nights of spring, eight hundred fortnights of summer, and eight hundred $fortnights of winter—so he lives for two thousand four hundred fortnights. 
684c$[He lives] for thirty-six thousand days and nights—twelve thousand $days and nights of spring, twelve thousand days and nights of summer, $and twelve thousand days and nights of winter—so he lives for thirty-six $thousand days and nights. 
$He eats seventy-two thousand meals, including the times of being pre￾vented [from eating] and the times of being breastfed. 
Being prevented $[from eating] happens when one cannot eat because of pain, cannot eat $because of anger, cannot eat because of sickness, cannot eat because of $being busy, cannot eat because one is traveling, cannot eat because one $is with the king, cannot eat because one is observing a day of purification, $or cannot eat because one cannot get [food]. 
$That is to say, monks, [a person] with a one-hundred-year life span $lives to the age of one hundred counted by years, [which alternatively $could be] counted by seasons, counted by years and seasons, counted by $months, counted by fortnights, counted by months and fortnights, counted $by days, counted by nights, counted by days and nights, counted by meals, $counted by prevention [from eating], or counted by meals and prevention $[from eating]. 
$Monks, what a teacher should do for his disciples out of great com￾passion, mercy, sympathy, and concern, seeking their benefit and welfare, $seeking their safety and well-being, that I have now already done. 
You $too should do your part. 
Go and sit in meditation and contemplation in a $secluded place, on a mountain, in a forest, at the base of a tree, in an empty $and quiet place. 
Do not be negligent. 
Make a diligent effort, lest you regret $it later. 
This is my instruction, this is my teaching. 
$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks $were delighted and received it respectfully. 
$161. 
^ck The Discourse to Brahmāyu291$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying in the country of 685a$Videha together with a great company of monks. 
$281$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$At that time there was in Mithilā a brahmin named Brahmāyu who was $very wealthy and prosperous, with immeasurable wealth, with livestock and $estates beyond estimation, and with an abundance of flourishing feudatories. 
$Mithilā with its water, pasture, and timber had been granted to him as a brah￾min’s fief by the king of Magadha, Ajātasattu Vedehiputta. 
The brahmin $Brahmāyu had a young brahmin [disciple] named Uttara, who was born of $parents of pure descent. 
For seven generations on both his father’s and $mother’s sides there had been uninterrupted continuity of births without $blemish. 
He had learned much, retained it, and was able to recite it. 
He was $a master of the four Vedas with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and $etymology, and the histories as a fifth.292$The brahmin Brahmāyu heard that the renunciant Gotama from the Sakya $lineage, who had left the Sakya clan, shaved off hair and beard, donned the $yellow robes, and out of faith left the household life and became homeless $to train in the path, was staying in the country of Videha together with a large $company of monks. 
The renunciant Gotama had a great reputation, which $had spread throughout the ten directions, namely: the renunciant Gotama is $a tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened, endowed with knowledge $and [perfect] conduct, a well-gone one, a knower of the world, an unsurpass￾able person, a leader on the path of Dharma, a teacher of devas and human $beings, known as the Buddha, an exalted one. 
In this world, with its devas, $māras, Brahmās, renunciants, and brahmins, from human beings to devas, $he has himself known and realized, and dwells having himself accomplished $realization. 
The Dharma he teaches is good in the beginning, good in the $middle, and good in the end, with its meaning and phrasing, endowed with $purity, and he reveals the holy life. 
$Again, he heard that the renunciant Gotama was endowed with the thirty￾two marks of a great man.293 For one who is endowed with these marks of a $great man, there truly are only two real possibilities. 
If he lives the home $life, he will certainly become a wheel-turning monarch, intelligent and wise, $equipped with a fourfold army to reign over the entire world, freely, as he $likes. 
Being a righteous Dharma king, he will attain the seven treasures. 
$Those seven treasures are: the wheel treasure, the elephant treasure, the horse $treasure, the jewel treasure, the woman treasure, the steward treasure, and $the counselor treasure—these are the seven. 
$282$Division 12$He will have a thousand sons, handsome, brave, fearless, and able to over￾come the troops of others. 
He will certainly rule over the whole earth, as far $as the ocean, without sword or club, just by teaching the Dharma, bringing 685b peace and happiness. 
$If [however,] he shaves off hair and beard, dons the yellow robes, leaves $home out of faith, and goes forth to train in the path, then he will certainly $become a tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened. 
His fame will $spread and be known throughout the ten directions. 
$Having heard this, the brahmin Brahmāyu said: $Uttara, I have heard thus: The renunciant Gotama from the Sakya lineage, $who left the Sakya clan, shaved off his hair and beard, donned the yellow $robes, and out of faith left the household life and became homeless to train $in the path, is staying in the country of Videha together with a large company $of monks. 
Uttara, the renunciant Gotama has a great reputation, which has $spread throughout the ten directions, namely: the renunciant Gotama is a $tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened, endowed with knowledge $and [perfect] conduct, a well-gone one, a knower of the world, an unsur￾passable person, a leader on the path of Dharma, a teacher of devas and $human beings, known as the Buddha, an exalted one.

$The brahmin Brahmāyu said: $Uttara, you approach the renunciant Gotama. 
Examine the renunciant $Gotama to see whether he is so or not so. 
Does he really have the thirty￾two marks of a great man?295$Having heard this, the young brahmin Uttara paid homage with his head $at the feet of the brahmin Brahmāyu, circumambulated him three times, and $left. 
Having approached the Buddha, he exchanged polite greetings, stepped $back, sat to one side, and examined the World-honored One’s body for the $thirty-two marks. 
He saw that the World-honored One’s body had thirty of $the marks, but he was in doubt regarding two of the marks: the concealed $male organ and the long, wide tongue. 
$The World-honored One thought, “This Uttara is examining my body for $the thirty-two marks. 
He sees that I have thirty of the marks, but he is in doubt $regarding two of the marks: the concealed male organ and the long, wide $tongue. 
Let me now remove his doubt.” Having discerned this, the World-hon￾ored One [thought], “I will perform an appropriate psychic feat. 
By performing $the appropriate psychic feat, I will cause the young brahmin Uttara to see that $my body has the concealed male organ and the long, wide tongue.” $Then the World-honored One performed the appropriate psychic feat. 
The $appropriate psychic feat having been performed, the young brahmin Uttara $saw that the World-honored One’s body had the concealed male organ and $that his tongue was long and wide. 
As for the long, wide tongue, he extended $it from his mouth so that it completely covered his face. 
$Having seen this, the young brahmin Uttara thought: “The renunciant 686a$Gotama is indeed endowed with the thirty-two marks of a great man. 
For $one who is endowed with these marks of a great man, there truly are only $285$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$two real possibilities. 
If he lives the home life, he will certainly become a $wheel-turning monarch, intelligent and wise, equipped with a fourfold army $to reign over the entire world, freely, as he likes.

Those seven treasures are: the wheel $treasure, the elephant treasure, the horse treasure, the jewel treasure, the $woman treasure, the steward treasure, and the counselor treasure—these are $the seven.

His fame will $spread and be known throughout the ten directions.” $The young brahmin Uttara further thought, “Let me now closely examine $his bearing and behavior and examine the inclinations that he demonstrates.” $Then the young brahmin Uttara closely followed the Buddha’s activities. 
For $the four months of the summer he examined his bearing and behavior and $examined the inclinations that he demonstrated.296 After the four months of $the summer the young brahmin Uttara was pleased with the World-honored $One’s bearing and behavior, having examined the inclinations he demon￾strated. 
He said, “Gotama, I now have affairs [to attend to]. 
Wishing to return, $I request to take my leave.” $The World-honored One said, “Uttara, you may leave as you wish.” $The young brahmin Uttara, having heard what the World-honored One $had said, having received it well and retained it well, rose from his seat, cir￾cumambulated him three times, and left. 
He approached the brahmin Brah￾māyu. 
Having paid homage with his head at the feet of the brahmin Brahmāyu, $he stepped back and sat to one side. 
$The brahmin Brahmāyu asked him: $Uttara, is what I have heard true? The renunciant Gotama has a great rep￾utation, which has spread throughout in the ten directions. 
Is he so or is $he not so? Does he really have the thirty-two marks of a great man? $The young brahmin Uttara replied: $286$Division 12$Indeed, venerable sir, what you have heard is true. 
The renunciant Gotama $has a great reputation, which has spread throughout the ten directions. 
$The renunciant Gotama is so; he is not otherwise. 
He really does have the $thirty-two marks of a great man. 
$Venerable sir, the renunciant Gotama’s feet stand flat and even on the $ground.

If he lives the home life, he will certainly become $a wheel-turning monarch, intelligent and wise, equipped with a fourfold $army to reign over the entire world, freely, as he likes. 
Being a righteous $Dharma king, he will attain the seven treasures. 
Those seven treasures are: $the wheel treasure, the elephant treasure, the horse treasure, the jewel treasure, $289$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$the woman treasure, the steward treasure, and the counselor treasure—these $are the seven. 
He will have a thousand sons, handsome, brave, fearless, and $will be able to overcome the troops of others. 
He will certainly rule over the $whole earth, as far as the ocean, without relying on sword or club, just by $teaching the Dharma, bringing peace and happiness. 
$If [however,] he shaves off hair and beard, dons the yellow robes, $leaves home out of faith, and goes forth to train in the path, then he will $certainly become a tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened. 
$His fame will spread and be known throughout the ten directions. 
$Again, venerable sir, I have seen the renunciant Gotama as he puts on $his [inner] robe; having put on his [inner] robe, as he covers himself with $the [outer] robe; having covered himself with the [outer] robe, as he goes $out of the hut; having gone out of the hut, as he goes out of the [monastery] $park; having gone out of the [monastery] park, as he walks on the road to $the village and as he enters the village; having entered the village along $an alley, as he enters a house; having entered a house, as he arranges his $seat; having arranged his seat, as he sits down; having sat down, as he $washes his hands; having washed his hands, as he accepts food and drink; $having accepted food and drink, as he consumes them; having consumed $them, as he washes his hands and gives a blessing; [having given a blessing,] $as he rises from the seat and leaves the house; having left the house, as he $leaves the village along an alley; having left the village, as he enters the $[monastery] park; having entered the [monastery] park, as he enters the $hut; and having entered the hut.298 [On allsuch occasions,] venerable sir, $the renunciant Gotama wears the [inner] robe neatly, neither [too] high nor $[too] low; his [inner] robe is not [worn] too tightly on the body, nor is the $wind able to blow the [inner] robe away from his body. 
Venerable sir, the $renunciant Gotama covers himself with the [outer] robe neatly, neither [too] $high nor [too] low; the [outer] robe is not [worn] too tightly on his body, nor $is the wind able to blow the [outer] robe away from his body. 
$Venerable sir, the renunciant Gotama always, when wearing new robes, $[makes them] following the custom of the noble ones by cutting [the cloth] $with a knife. 
He dyes it an unattractive color just as the noble ones dye it $an unattractive color. 
He wears the robes not as property, not out of pride, $not to decorate himself, not for adornment, but just for protection against $290^taisho687a Division 12$mosquitoes and gadflies, against contact with wind and sun, and to cover $the body out of a sense of modesty. 
$When emerging from a hut, he does not stoop and [then] straighten up $his body. 
Venerable sir, the renunciant Gotama never stoops as he emerges $from a hut. 
Venerable sir, when the renunciant Gotama wishes to walk, $he raises his right foot first. 
He raises [each foot] straight and puts it down $straight, walking without disorderliness and without disarray. 
As he walks, $the two ankles never bump against each other. 
Venerable sir, as he walks $the renunciant Gotama is not dirtied by dust. 
Why is that? Because of his $naturally good way of walking. 
$When emerging from the [monastery] park, he does not stoop and $[then] straighten up his body [to pass through a low entrance gate]. 
Ven￾erable sir, the renunciant Gotama never stoops as he emerges from the $[monastery] park. 
In turning toward the village, he turns his entire body $to the right and observes in the manner of an elephant. 
He observes all $over, just observing, without anxiety or concern, without surprise, observing $in all directions. 
Why is that? Because he is a tathāgata, free from attach￾ment, fully awakened. 
$When entering the village, he does not stoop and [then] straighten up $his body. 
Venerable sir, the renunciant Gotama never stoops as he enters $a village. 
When being on a street or lane he looks neither down nor up; $he looks only straight ahead with unobstructed knowledge and vision. 
$Venerable sir, the faculties of the renunciant Gotama are always com￾posed. 
Why is that? Because of his inherently good mode of practice. 
$When entering a house, he does not stoop and [then] straighten up his $body. 
Venerable sir, the renunciant Gotama never stoops as he enters a $house. 
Venerable sir, the renunciant Gotama turns his body to the right, $arranges the seat, and sits down. 
In sitting down on the seat he does not $do so with the full force of his body. 
He also does not place his hands on $his thighs as he sits down on the seat. 
Having sat down on the seat, he is $not restless, not disturbed, but neither is he jolly. 
In receiving water for $washing, he [holds his hands] neither [too] high nor [too] low [and he $uses] neither [too] much [water] nor [too] little. 
$In receiving food and drink, he [holds his bowl] neither [too] high nor $[too] low, [and he accepts] neither [too] much [food] nor [too] little. 
Venerable $291$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$292$sir, in receiving food, the renunciant Gotama keeps his bowl level and $[accepts] curries and rice to eat in equal proportions.299 Venerable sir, the $renunciant Gotama forms the food into a ball neatly and puts it into his $mouth slowly. 
He does not open his mouth until the ball of food has $reached it, and when it is inside his mouth, he chews it three times before $swallowing it. 
No rice or curry that is not broken up [by chewing] remains $in his mouth when the next ball follows. 
$Venerable sir, the renunciant Gotama eats with three kinds of purity. 
$He wishes to experience the taste, but he does not wish to be defiled by $that taste. 
He eats not for the sake of wealth, not out of pride, not for the $sake of his appearance, not for adornment, but just wishing to maintain $the body, so that it may long endure without trouble. 
He uses [food] to $arrest old disease and prevent the arising of new illness, to preserve life $without trouble and to have strength and comfort. 
$Having completed the meal, when receiving water for hand washing, $[he holds his hands] neither [too] high nor [too] low, and [takes] neither $[too] much [water] nor [too] little. 
In receiving water for washing the $bowl [he holds the bowl] neither [too] high nor [too] low, and takes neither $[too] much [water] nor [too] little. 
When he has washed his hands clean, $his bowl is also clean; when he has washed his bowl clean, his hands are $also clean. 
Having wiped his hands, he then wipes the bowl; having wiped $the bowl, he then wipes his hands. 
$Having washed and wiped the bowl, he places it to one side, neither $[too] close nor [too] far away. 
He does not keep looking at the bowl; he $is not possessive of the bowl. 
He does not criticize this food or praise that $food. 
Instead, he keeps silent for a little while.300 After that he teaches the $Dharma to the householders, exhorting and inspiring them, fully delighting $them, teaching them the Dharma with countless skillful means. 
Having $exhorted and inspired them, fully delighting them, he rises from his seat $and withdraws to return [to the monastery]. 
$When leaving the house, he does not stoop and [then] straighten up $his body. 
$Venerable sir, the renunciant Gotama never stoops as he leaves a house. 
$When on a street or lane he looks neither down nor up; he looks only $straight ahead with unobstructed knowledge and vision. 
Venerable sir, ^taisho687b Division 12$the faculties of the renunciant Gotama are always composed. 
Why is that? $Because of his inherently good mode of practice. 
$When he goes out of the village, he does not stoop and [then] straighten $up his body. 
Venerable sir, the renunciant Gotama never stoops when $going out of a village. 
When he enters the [monastery] park, he does not $stoop and [then] straighten up his body. 
Venerable sir, the renunciant $Gotama never stoops when entering a [monastery] park. 
$After the midday meal, he puts away his [outer] robe and bowl, washes $his hands and feet, puts his sitting mat over his shoulder, and enters a hut $to sit in meditation. 
Venerable sir, the renunciant Gotama enters a hut to $sit in meditation for the welfare of the whole world. 
Venerable sir, the $renunciant Gotama rises from sitting in meditation in the afternoon with $radiant complexion. 
Why is that? Because he is a tathāgata, free from $attachment, fully awakened. 
$Venerable sir, the voice that emerges from the mouth of the renunciant $Gotama has eight qualities: first, it is very deep; second, it is melodious; $third, it enters the heart; fourth, it is lovely; fifth, it is very sonorous; sixth, 687c it is lively; seventh, it is clear and distinct; eighth, it is wise. 
Many people $love it, many delight in it, many recall it and thereby gain calmness of mind. 
$Venerable sir, when the renunciant Gotama teaches the Dharma to an $assembly, the sound does not go beyond the assembly; it just remains $within [the confines of] the assembly. 
He teaches the Dharma to [his lis￾teners], exhorting and inspiring them, fully delighting them, teaching $them the Dharma with countless skillful means. 
Having exhorted and $inspired them, fully delighting them, he rises from his seat and withdraws $to return to his former place. 
$Venerable sir, such is the appearance of the renunciant Gotama; yet he $has other excellent qualities beyond these. 
Venerable sir, I wish to approach $the renunciant Gotama and train in the holy life under him.301$The brahmin Brahmāyu said, “Do as you wish.” $Then the young brahmin Uttara paid homage with his head at the feet of $the brahmin Brahmāyu, circumambulated him three times, and left. 
He $approached the Buddha, paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet, $stepped back, and sat to one side. 
He said: $293$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$World-honored One, may I train in the path under the World-honored $One! [May I] receive full ordination and become a monk, so that I can $practice the holy life under the World-honored One! $Then the World-honored One allowed the young brahmin Uttara to train $in the path by giving him the full ordination. 
Having allowed the young brah￾min Uttara to train in the path by giving him the full ordination, he traveled $in the country of Videha together with a great company of monks, proceeding $by stages to Mithilā. 
In Mithilā he stayed in Mahādeva’s Mango Grove. 
$The brahmins and householders of Mithilā heard that the renunciant $Gotama from the Sakya lineage, who had left the Sakya clan and gone forth $to train in the path, had been traveling in the country of Videha together with $a large company of monks, proceeding by stages to Mithilā, and was staying $in Mahādeva’s Mango Grove. 
$[They had heard this:] “The renunciant Gotama has a great reputation, $which has spread throughout the ten directions. 
The renunciant Gotama is a $tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened, accomplished in knowledge $and conduct. 
He is a well-gone one, a knower of the world, an unsurpassable $person, a leader on the path of Dharma, a teacher of devas and human beings, $known as the Buddha, an exalted one. 
In this world, with its devas, māras, $Brahmās, renunciants, and brahmins, from human beings to devas, he has $himself known and realized, and dwells having personally accomplished $realization. 
The Dharma he teaches is good in the beginning, good in the $middle, and good in the end, with its meaning and phrasing, endowed with $purity, and he reveals the holy life.” $[They thought]: “One who visits the Tathāgata, free from attachment, $fully awakened, who reveres and pays homage to him, supports him and $respects him, swiftly gains excellent benefits. 
Let us go together and visit $the renunciant Gotama, pay homage to him, and support and honor him.” $The brahmins and householders of Mithilā, each accompanied by their $family members, went out of Mithilā and proceeded northward to Mahā-$deva’s Mango Grove, desiring to visit the World-honored One, pay homage $to him, and support him. 
Having approached the Buddha, some brahmins $and householders from Mithilā paid homage with their heads at the Buddha’s $feet, stepped back, and sat to one side; some exchanged polite greetings with $294^taisho688a Division 12$the Buddha, stepped back, and sat to one side; some extended their hands $with joined palms toward the Buddha, stepped back, and sat to one side; and $some, having seen the Buddha from afar, sat down in silence. 
$When the brahmins and householders of Mithilā had all sat down, the $Buddha taught them the Dharma, exhorting and inspiring them, fully delight￾ing them, teaching them the Dharma with countless skillful means. 
Having $exhorted and inspired them, fully delighting them, he remained silent. 
$The brahmin Brahmāyu heard that the renunciant Gotama from the Sakya $lineage, who had left the Sakya clan and gone forth to train in the path, had $been traveling in the country of Videha together with a large company of $monks, proceeding by stages to Mithilā, and was staying in Mahādeva’s $Mango Grove. 
$[He also had heard this:] “The renunciant Gotama has a great reputation, $which has spread throughout the ten directions.

In this world, with its devas, māras, $Brahmās, renunciants, and brahmins, from human beings to devas, he has $himself known and realized, and dwells, having personally accomplished $realization. 
The Dharma he teaches is good in the beginning, good in the $middle, and good in the end, with its meaning and phrasing, endowed with $purity, and he reveals the holy life.” $[He thought:] “One who visits the Tathāgata, free from attachment, fully $awakened, who reveres and pays homage to him, supports him and respects $him, swiftly gains excellent benefits. 
Let me go and visit the renunciant $Gotama, pay homage to him, and support him.” $The brahmin Brahmāyu said to his charioteer, “Quickly prepare the chariot. 
$I wish to approach the renunciant Gotama now.” $Having received this instruction, the charioteer quickly completed preparing $the chariot, returned, and said, “The chariot is prepared. 
The venerable one $himself will know the proper time.” Then Brahmāyu, driving that extremely $fine chariot, went out of Mithilā and proceeded northward to Mahādeva’s $Mango Grove, desiring to visit the World-honored One, to pay homage to $him and support him. 
$295$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$296$At that time the World-honored One was teaching the Dharma surrounded $by an immense assembly. 
The brahmin Brahmāyu saw from afar that the $World-honored One was teaching the Dharma surrounded by an immense $assembly. 
Seeing this, he felt intimidated. 
Then Brahmāyu avoided [the sit￾uation] by driving to a tree beside the road and remaining under it.302 He said $to a young brahmin: $Approach the renunciant Gotama and on my behalf inquire if the noble $one is in good health, strong in body, comfortable, free from ailments, $and if he is dwelling at ease with his usual vigor. 
Say this: “Gotama, my $teacher Brahmāyu inquires: ‘Are you in good health, strong, comfortable, $free from ailments, and dwelling at ease with your usual vigor? Gotama, $my teacher Brahmāyu wishes to come and visit the renunciant Gotama.’” $Then the young brahmin, receiving the instruction, walked over and $approached the Buddha. 
He exchanged polite greetings, stepped back, sat to $one side, and said: $Gotama, my teacher Brahmāyu inquires: “Is the noble one is in good $health, strong in body, comfortable, free from ailments, and dwelling at $ease with your usual vigor?” Gotama, my teacher Brahmāyu wishes to $come and visit the renunciant Gotama. 
$The World-honored One said: $Young brahmin, may the brahmin Brahmāyu find well-being and happi￾ness! May devas, human beings, asuras, gandhabbas, yakkhas, and other $forms of life find well-being and happiness! Young brahmin, if the brahmin $Brahmāyu wishes to come, let him do as he wishes.303$Then the young brahmin, having heard what the Buddha said, received it well $and retained it well. 
He rose from his seat, circumambulated the Buddha three $times, and left. 
He returned to the brahmin Brahmāyu and told him: $Venerable sir, I have communicated with the renunciant Gotama. 
The $renunciant Gotama is now waiting for the venerable one. 
May the venerable $one know the proper time. 
$The brahmin Brahmāyu descended from the chariot and approached the ^taisho688b Division 12$297$Buddha on foot. 
On seeing from afar the brahmin Brahmāyu coming, the $assembly rose from their seats to make way for him. 
Why is that? Because $he was famous, virtuous, and widely renowned. 
$The brahmin Brahmāyu said to the assembly, “Friends, be seated again, $all of you! I wish to go straight on and visit the renunciant Gotama.” Then $Brahmāyu approached the Buddha, exchanged polite greetings, stepped back, $and sat to one side. 
$At that time two of Brahmāyu’s sense faculties were still good: the eye faculty $and the ear faculty. 
Having sat down, the brahmin Brahmāyu carefully examined $the Buddha’s body for the thirty-two marks. 
He saw thirty marks but was in $doubt about two marks: the concealed male organ and the long, wide tongue. 
$Then the brahmin Brahmāyu asked the World-honored One in verse: $As I heard long ago, $[There are] thirty-two marks of a great man. 
$Searching, I cannot see two of them. 
$Does the body of the venerable renunciant Gotama $Have a concealed male organ? $All men venerate [this] deep secret. 
$Why does the most venerated of men $Not display his mysterious tongue $If the venerable one does have a long, wide tongue? $Let him enable me to see [these two marks]! $I now really have doubt in my mind. 
$May the tamer of those to be tamed resolve my doubt! $The World-honored One thought, “This brahmin Brahmāyu is searching my $body for the thirty-two marks. 
He sees thirty but is in doubt about two: the con￾cealed male organ and the long, wide tongue. 
Let me now remove his doubt.” $Having understood this, the World-honored One performed a feat of supernormal $power. 
The feat of supernormal power having been performed, the brahmin $Brahmāyu saw that the World-honored One’s body did have the concealed male $organ and the long, wide tongue. 
As for the long, wide tongue, when the tongue $came out of his mouth it completely covered his face. 
688c$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Having concluded the feat of supernormal power, the World-honored One $spoke these stanzas to the brahmin Brahmāyu: $As you heard long ago, $[There are] thirty-two marks of a great man. 
$All of them are found in my body. 
$I am fully, properly, and superbly endowed with them, $Being a trainer of those to be trained. 
Cut off your doubt about me, $Brahmin, develop sublime faith! $Very rare it is to get to see and hear $One who has rightly and fully awakened to the Supreme. 
$Extremely rare is the appearance in the world $Of one who has rightly and fully awakened to the Supreme. 
$Brahmin, I am rightly awakened, $A king of the unsurpassable true Dharma.304$Having heard this, the brahmin Brahmāyu thought: $This renunciant Gotama is indeed endowed with the thirty-two marks of a $great man. 
For one who is endowed with these marks of a great man, there $truly are only two real possibilities. 
If he lives the home life, he will certainly $become a wheel-turning monarch, intelligent and wise, equipped with a four￾fold army to reign over the entire world, freely, as he likes. 
Being a righteous $Dharma king, he will attain the seven treasures. 
Those seven treasures are: $the wheel treasure, the elephant treasure, the horse treasure, the jewel treasure, $the woman treasure, the steward treasure, and the counselor treasure—these $are the seven. 
He will have a thousand sons, handsome, brave, fearless, and $will be able to overcome the troops of others. 
He will certainly rule over the $whole earth, as far as the ocean, without relying on sword or club, just by $teaching the Dharma, bringing peace and happiness. 
$If, [however], he shaves off hair and beard, dons the yellow robes, $leaves home out of faith, and goes forth to train in the path, then he will $certainly become a tathāgata, free from attachment and fully awakened. 
$His fame will spread and be known throughout the ten directions. 
$Then the World-honored One thought, “This brahmin Brahmāyu has for $a long time been without flattery and deceit. 
Whatever he wishes, whatever $298$Division 12$299$he asks will be entirely from a wish to understand and not to oppose or to $annoy; he is like that. 
Let me teach him the profound higher Dharma (Abhi -$dharma).” Having understood this, the World-honored One spoke to the brah￾min Brahmāyu in verse: $For the sake of rejoicing in the Dharma in the present life $And for much benefit in the next life, $Brahmin, you may ask about such matters $According to your own wishes. 
$Whatever you ask about $I will cut off your doubt. 
$Having been permitted by the World-honored One to ask questions, the $brahmin Brahmāyu therefore asked the World-honored One about matters $in accordance with what he originally intended [to ask]: $How is one a brahmin? $What is the significance of the threefold attainment? $By virtue of what is one said to be without attachment? $What is perfect full awakening?305$Then the World-honored One replied in verse: $Eradicating evil and unwholesome states, $Being established and dwelling in celibacy, $Cultivating the conduct of brahmins,306$By these one is a brahmin. 
$Having higher knowledge of one’s past [existences], $Seeing happy and evil destinies, $Achieving the complete destruction of ignorance,307$With these [three] knowledges, one is established as a sage. 
$Knowing well that the mind has been purified, $Completely shedding sensual passion, anger, and delusion, $Accomplishing the three knowledges, $By this one has the threefold attainment. 
^taisho689a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$300$Abstaining from unwholesome states, $Rightly established in the foremost of purposes, $Revered by the world as foremost, $By these one is without attachment. 
$Being of much benefit to devas and human beings, $Bestowing vision and destroying dissention, $Knowing widely and manifesting vision that is complete, $With these one is perfectly and fully awakened. 
$At this the brahmin Brahmāyu got up from his seat, wishing to pay homage $with his head at the Buddha’s feet.308 Then that great assembly made a huge $uproar: $The renunciant Gotama is very wonderful, very remarkable! He has great $spiritual power, great virtue, great merit, great power! Why is that? $Among brahmins and householders in this country of Mithilā the brahmin $Brahmāyu is foremost, because of his birth. 
The brahmin Brahmāyu is $born to parents of pure descent. 
For seven generations on both his father’s $and his mother’s sides there has been uninterrupted continuity of births $without blemish. 
[Yet] he [wants to] prostrate himself humbly before the $renunciant Gotama, revering, worshiping, supporting, and respecting him.309$The renunciant Gotama is very wonderful, very remarkable! He has $great spiritual power, great virtue, great merit, great power! Why is that? $Among brahmins and householders in this country of Mithilā the brahmin $Brahmāyu is foremost, because of his learning. 
The brahmin Brahmāyu has $learned much, retained it, and is able to recite it. 
He is a master of the four $Vedas with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and etymology, and the $histories as a fifth. 
[Yet] he [wants to] prostrate himself humbly before the $renunciant Gotama, revering, worshiping, supporting, and respecting him. 
$The renunciant Gotama is very wonderful, very remarkable! He has $great spiritual power, great virtue, great merit, great power! Why is that? $Among brahmins and householders in this country of Mithilā the brahmin $Brahmāyu is foremost, because of his wealth. 
The brahmin Brahmāyu is $very wealthy and prosperous, with immeasurable wealth, with livestock $and estates beyond estimation, and with an abundance of flourishing feuda￾tories. 
Mithilā with its water, pastures, and timber was granted to him as ^taisho689b Division 12$a brahmin’s fief by the king of Magadha, Ajātasattu Vedehiputta. 
[Yet] he $[wants to] prostrate himself humbly before the renunciant Gotama, rever￾ing, worshiping, supporting, and respecting him. 
$The renunciant Gotama is very wonderful, very remarkable! He has $great spiritual power, great virtue, great merit, great power! Why is that? $Among brahmins and householders in this country of Mithilā the brahmin $Brahmāyu is foremost, because of his age. 
The brahmin Brahmāyu is very $old, endowed with a life span of one hundred and twenty-six years. 
[Yet] $he [wants to] prostrate himself humbly before the renunciant Gotama, $revering, worshiping, supporting, and respecting him. 
$Then the World-honored One, with his knowledge of other minds, knew $the thoughts in the minds of the great assembly. 
Having understood it, the $World-honored One said to the brahmin Brahmāyu: “Stop, stop, brahmin, $though my mind is pleased and satisfied [by your wish to pay respect]. 
Return $to your seat and I will teach you the Dharma.” $Then the brahmin Brahmāyu, having paid homage with his head at the $Buddha’s feet, stepped back and sat to one side. 
The World-honored One $taught him the Dharma, exhorting and inspiring him, fully delighting him, $teaching him the Dharma with countless skillful means. 
Having exhorted $and inspired him, fully delighted him, he did as all buddhas do when first $teaching the true Dharma to delight their hearers. 
He taught him about gen￾erosity, virtue, rebirth in heaven, the disadvantages of sensual desire, and $the defilement of [continued] birth and death, extolling the excellence of dis￾passion and the purity of the constituents of the path. 
Having taught him like $this, the Buddha knew that [Brahmāyu’s] mind was delighted, prepared, mal￾leable, resolute, uplifted, unified, free of doubt, free of the hindrances, [pos￾sessing] the ability and power to receive the true Dharma of the Buddha. 
$In accordance with the essential teaching of all buddhas, the World-honored $One taught him about dukkha, its arising, its cessation, and the path [leading $to its cessation]. 
While seated [right there], the brahmin Brahmāyu saw the $four noble truths: dukkha, its arising, its cessation, and the path [leading to $its cessation]. 
Just as a piece of white cloth is easily dyed, so the brahmin $Brahmāyu, while seated [right there], saw the four noble truths: dukkha, its $arising, its cessation, and the path [leading to its cessation]. 
$301$302$Then the brahmin Brahmāyu, having seen the Dharma, having attained $the Dharma, awakened of his own accord to the pure Dharma, cut off doubt, $and overcame uncertainty. 
[For him] there was no other teacher; he would $no longer follow others. 
Without hesitation, he abided in the realization of $the fruit. 
In the teaching of the World-honored One he had attained fearless￾ness. 
He rose from his seat, paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet, $[saying:] $World-honored One, from now on I go for refuge to the Buddha, the $Dharma, and the Sangha of monks. 
May the World-honored One accept $me as a lay disciple from this day forth until the end of life, as having $personally gone for refuge for my whole life.310$Then the brahmin Brahmāyu held his hands with joined palms [in respect] $toward the Buddha and said, “May the World-honored One condescend to $accept my invitation for [the meal] tomorrow, together with the Sangha of $monks.” The World-honored One accepted for the sake of the brahmin Brah￾māyu by remaining silent. 
$Knowing that the World-honored One had accepted by remaining silent, $the brahmin Brahmāyu paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet, cir￾cumambulated him three times and returned to his home. 
That night he had $various kinds of fine dishes prepared, very delicious, plentiful, and easy to $digest. 
When the preparations were completed, at dawn, he put out seats and $announced that the time had come: “World-honored One, the meal has been $prepared. 
May the Noble One know the proper time.” $Then, when the night was over, at dawn, the World-honored One put on $his [outer] robe and took his bowl. 
Followed by the monks, the World-honored $One led the way to the house of the brahmin Brahmāyu. 
He sat down on a $seat prepared in front of the Sangha of monks. 
When the brahmin Brahmāyu $knew that the World-honored One and the Sangha of monks had settled into $their seats, he personally brought water for washing [their hands], and per￾sonally offered various kinds of fine dishes, delicious, plentiful, and easy to $digest, making sure there was enough. 
After the meal, he gathered up the $utensils, brought water for washing, and then seated himself on a small seat $to one side to receive the blessing. 
^taisho689c Division 12$303$When the brahmin Brahmāyu had sat down, the World-honored One gave $him a blessing:311$The fire oblation is the foremost of sacrifices, $The universal sound is the root of all sounds, $The king is foremost among men, $The ocean is chief among rivers. 
$The moon is brightest among the constellations, $[But] in brightness nothing surpasses the sun. 
$Above, below, in all the [ten] directions, $And in all the worlds, $From human beings to devas, $The Buddha alone is foremost. 
$Then, having spoken these blessings to the brahmin Brahmāyu, the World￾honored One rose from his seat and left. 
Having stayed in the country of $Mithilā for some days, he gathered his robes, took his bowl, and traveled $toward Sāvatthī. 
Having proceeded by stages to Sāvatthī, he stayed in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$Then a group of many monks, while begging for almsfood in Sāvatthī, $heard that the brahmin Brahmāyu of Mithilā, who had asked the Buddha in $verse about some matters, had passed away. 
Having heard this, after having $partaken of their midday meal, putting away their [outer] robes and bowls, $and washing their hands and feet, the monks put their sitting mats over their $shoulders and approached the Buddha. 
Having paid homage with their heads $[at his feet], they stepped back, stood to one side, and said: $World-honored One, having put on our robes at dawn and taken our bowls, $we as a group of many monks entered Sāvatthi to beg for almsfood. 
At that $time we heard that the brahmin Brahmāyu of Mithilā, who had asked the $Buddha in verse about some matters, has passed away. 
World-honored One, $where has he gone? Where will he be reborn? What is his future destiny? $The World-honored One replied: $Monks, the brahmin Brahmāyu possessed the foremost great benefit. 
At $his last, he came to know the Dharma, yet he did not trouble me for the ^taisho690a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$sake of the Dharma. 
Monks, through having eradicated the five lower $fetters the brahmin Brahmāyu will take birth <in between> and attain $final nirvana there.312 Having attained the state of not falling back from $the Dharma, he will not come back to this world. 
$At that time the World-honored One declared that Brahmāyu had attained $nonreturn. 
$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the brahmin $Brahmāyu and the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.$304$Division 13$On Basic Analysis$162. 
^ck The Discourse on an Analysis $of the Six Elements313$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha, who was dwelling in the country $of Magadha, approached Rājagaha to stay overnight. 
Then the World-honored $One approached the house of a potter and said to the potter, “I would like to $stay the night in your pottery. 
Will you give permission?” $The potter replied, “I have no objection. 
However, there is a monk who $came first and is already staying there. 
If he gives permission, then you may $stay as you wish.” $At that time the venerable Pukkusāti was already staying in that pottery. 
$So the World-honored One went out of the potter’s house, entered the pottery, $and said to the venerable Pukkusāti, “Monk, I would like to stay the night $in the pottery. 
Will you give permission?” $The venerable Pukkusāti replied, “Sir, I have no objection. 
Furthermore, $in this pottery there are straw seats already set out. 
Sir, if you wish to stay, $you may do as you wish.” $Then the World-honored One went out of the pottery, washed his feet, $and came back inside. 
He spread his sitting mat on a straw seat, sat down 690b cross-legged, and spent the night in silence, seated in meditation with a con￾centrated mind. 
The venerable Pukkusāti also spent the night in silence, $seated in meditation with a concentrated mind. 
$Then the World-honored One thought, “It is marvelous and wonderful $how this monk stays tranquil and quiet. 
Let me ask him this: ‘Monk, who is $your teacher? In dependence on whom have you gone forth to train in the $path, having accepted his Dharma?”’ $Having thought this, the World-honored One asked, “Monk, who is your $teacher? In dependence on whom have you gone forth to train in the path, $having accepted his Dharma?” $305$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$The venerable Pukkusāti replied: $Venerable friend, there is the renunciant Gotama from the Sakyan lineage $who left the Sakyan clan, shaved off hair and beard, donned the yellow $robes, and out of faith left the household life and became homeless to $train in the path. 
He has realized the unsurpassable right and total awak￾ening. 
He is my teacher. 
In dependence on him I have gone forth to train $in the path, having accepted his Dharma. 
$The World-honored One asked further, “Monk, have you ever seen your $teacher?”314$The venerable Pukkusāti replied, “I have not seen him.” $The World-honored One asked further, “If you saw your teacher, would $you recognize him?” $The venerable Pukkusāti replied: $I would not recognize him. 
However, venerable friend, I have heard that $the World-honored One is a tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awak￾ened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, a well-gone one, a knower $of the world, an unsurpassable person, leader on the path of Dharma, $teacher of devas and human beings, called a buddha, an exalted one. 
He $is my teacher. 
In dependence on him I have gone forth to train in the path, $having accepted his Dharma. 
$Then, the World-honored One thought, “This clansman has gone forth to $train in the path in dependence on me, having accepted my Dharma. 
Let me $now teach him the Dharma!” $Having thought this, the World-honored One said to the venerable $Pukkusāti: $Monk, I will teach you the Dharma that is sublime in the beginning, sub￾lime in the middle, and also sublime in the end, with its meaning and $phrasing, endowed with purity, to reveal the holy life,315 namely the analysis $of the six elements. 
You should listen closely and pay proper attention. 
$The venerable Pukkusāti replied, “Yes indeed.” $The Buddha said to him: $306$Division 13$Monk, a human being is composed of six elements, has six spheres of $contact, and has eighteen mental activities. 
He [also] has four spheres of $stability, and if he is established in them, he does not experience distressing $objects. 
Not experiencing distressing objects, his mind does not give rise $to dislike, sadness, worry, or agitation.316 Such is the instruction: do not $neglect wisdom, protect the truth, and cultivate relinquishment. 
$Monk, one should train for the supreme, one should train to attain qui￾etude, by analyzing the six elements in this way. 
Monk, “a human being $is composed of six elements”—for what reason has this been said? It $refers to the earth element, the water element, the fire element, the wind $element, the space element, and the consciousness element. 
Monk—for $this reason it has been said: “a human being is composed of six elements.” $Monk, “a human being has six spheres of contact”—for what reason $has this been said? This means, monk, that through eye contact one sees 690c forms, through ear contact one hears sounds, through nose contact one $smells odors, through tongue contact one tastes flavors, through body $contact one experiences tangibles, and through mind contact one cognizes $mind objects.317 Monk, for this reason it has been said, “a human being $has six spheres of contact.” $Monk, “a human being has eighteen mental activities”—for what reason $has this been said? It means, monk, that on seeing a form with the eye, one $observes that form and abides in joy, [or] one observes that form and abides $in sadness, [or] one observes that form and abides in equanimity. 
In the $same way, with the ear ...
the nose ...
the tongue ...
the body ...
on cog￾nizing a mental object with the mind, one observes that mental object and $abides in joy, [or] one observes that mental object and abides in sadness, $[or] one observes that mental object and abides in equanimity. 
Monk, $these six observed with joy, six observed with sadness, and six observed $with equanimity together become eighteen activities. 
Monk, for this reason $it has been said: “a human being has eighteen mental activities.” $Monk, “a human being has four spheres of stability”—for what reason $has this been said? It refers to the sphere of stability in truth, the sphere $of stability in wisdom, the sphere of stability in relinquishment, and the $sphere of stability in appeasement. 
Monk, for this reason it has been said: $“a human being has four spheres of stability.” $307$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$How does a monk not neglect wisdom? Suppose that a monk discerns $in relation to the bodily elements: “in this present body of mine there is $the internal earth element, which was received at birth.” And what is it? $It is this: head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, rough and smooth epidermis, $skin, flesh, bones, sinews, kidneys, heart, liver, lungs, spleen, large intestine, $stomach, and feces—whatever is of this nature; and whatever else is found $in this body internally, whatever is contained in it internally that is solid, $that is of a solid nature and found internally, having been received at $birth—this, monk, is what is meant by the internal earth element. 
$Monk, whatever is the internal earth element and whatever is the exter￾nal earth element, all of that is collectively called the earth element. 
All $of it is not mine, I am not that, and it is not my self. 
On wisely contem￾plating it like this, knowing it as it really is, the mind does not become $defiled with attachment in regard to this earth element. 
This, monk, is $what is meant by not neglecting wisdom. 
$Again, monk, a monk does not neglect wisdom if he discerns in relation $to the bodily elements: “in this present body of mine there is the internal $water element, which was received at birth.” And what is it? It is this: $brain fluid,318 tears, sweat, mucus, saliva, pus, blood, fat, marrow, phlegm, $bile, and urine—whatever is of this nature; and whatever else is found in $this body internally, whatever is contained in it internally that is watery, $that is of a watery nature and moist internally, having been received at $birth—this, monk, is what is meant by the internal water element. 
$Monk, whatever is the internal water element and whatever is the exter￾nal water element, all of that is collectively called the water element. 
All $of that is not mine, I am not that, and it is not my self. 
On wisely contem￾plating it like this, knowing it as it really is, the mind does not become $defiled with attachment in regard to the water element. 
This, monk, is $what is meant by not neglecting wisdom. 
$Again, monk, a monk does not neglect wisdom if he discerns in relation $to the bodily elements: “in this present body of mine there is the internal $fire element, which was received at birth.” And what is it? It is this: bodily $heat, bodily warmth, bodily discomfort, warmth from bodily nourishment, $that is, from digesting food and drink—whatever is of this nature; and what￾ever else is found in this body internally, whatever is contained in it internally $308^taisho691a Division 13$that is fiery, that is of a fiery nature and hot internally, having been received $at birth—this, monk, is what is meant by the internal fire element. 
$Monk, whatever is the internal fire element and whatever is the external $fire element, all of that is collectively called the fire element. 
All of that $is not mine, I am not that, and it is not my self. 
On wisely contemplating $it like this, knowing it as it really is, the mind does not become defiled $with attachment in regard to the fire element. 
This, monk, is what is meant $by not neglecting wisdom. 
$Again, monk, a monk does not neglect wisdom if he discerns in relation $to the bodily elements: “in this present body of mine there is the internal $wind element, which was received at birth.” And what is it? It is this: $upward-moving winds, downward-moving winds, forceful winds, pulling $and contracting winds, disturbing winds, irregular winds, winds in the $joints, the winds of out-breaths, and the winds of in-breaths—whatever $is of this nature; and whatever else is found in this body internally, whatever $is contained in it internally that is windy, that is of a windy nature and $moves internally, having been received at birth—this, monk, is what is $meant by the internal wind element. 
$Monk, whatever is the internal wind element and whatever is the exter￾nal wind element, all of that is collectively called the wind element. 
All $of that is not mine, I am not that, and it is not my self. 
On wisely contem￾plating it like this, knowing it as it really is, the mind does not become $defiled with attachment in regard to the wind element. 
This, monk, is what $is meant by not neglecting wisdom. 
$Again, monk, a monk does not neglect wisdom if he discerns in relation $to the bodily elements: “in this present body of mine there is the internal $space element, which was received at birth.” And what is it? It is the space $for the eyes, the space in the ears, the space in the nostrils, the space in $the mouth, the throat, and so on, through which [food] can pass; it is where $food is chewed, held, dissolved, slowly passed through the throat, retained $[for a while], and [eventually] discharged below—whatever is of this $nature; and whatever else is found in this body internally, whatever is $contained in it internally that is space-like, whatever is found to be space￾like, not covered by flesh, skin, bone, or tendons—this, monk, is what is $meant by the internal space element. 
$309$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Monk, whatever is the internal space element and whatever is the exter￾nal space element, all of that is collectively called the space element. 
All $of that is not mine, I am not that, and it is not my self. 
On wisely contem￾plating it like this, knowing it as it really is, the mind does not become $defiled with attachment in regard to the space element. 
This, monk, is $what is meant by not neglecting wisdom. 
$Monk, if a monk knows these five elements as they truly are, having known $them as they truly are, his mind is not defiled by them but liberated from $them. 
There then remains just consciousness. 
Consciousness of what? Con￾sciousness of pleasure, consciousness of pain, consciousness of mental joy, $consciousness of mental sadness, consciousness of equanimity.319$Monk, because of pleasant contact there arises pleasant feeling; he $feels a pleasant feeling. 
On feeling a pleasant feeling, he knows he is $feeling a pleasant feeling. 
If for the monk this pleasant contact ceases, $then once the pleasant contact has ceased, the pleasant feeling that had $arisen from the pleasant contact also ceases and comes to an end; he knows $it has become cool. 
$Monk, because of painful contact there arises painful feeling; he feels a $painful feeling. 
On feeling a painful feeling, he knows he is feeling a painful $feeling. 
If for the monk this painful contact ceases, then once the painful $contact has ceased, the painful feeling that had arisen from the painful $contact also ceases and comes to an end; he knows it has become cool. 
$Monk, because of mentally joyful contact there arises mentally joyful feel￾ing; he feels a mentally joyful feeling. 
On feeling a mentally joyful feeling, $he knows he is feeling a mentally joyful feeling. 
If for the monk this mentally $joyful contact ceases, then once the mentally joyful contact has ceased, the $mentally joyful feeling that had arisen from the mentally joyful contact also $ceases and comes to an end; he knows it has become cool. 
$Monk, because of mentally sad contact there arises mentally sad feeling; $he feels a mentally sad feeling. 
Having felt a mentally sad feeling, he $knows he is feeling a mentally sad feeling. 
If for the monk this mentally $sad contact ceases, then once the mentally sad contact has ceased, the $mentally sad feeling that had arisen from the mentally sad contact also $ceases and comes to an end; he knows it has become cool. 
$310^taisho691b Division 13$Monk, because of equanimous contact there arises equanimous feeling; $he feels an equanimous feeling. 
On feeling an equanimous feeling, he $knows he is feeling an equanimous feeling. 
If for the monk this equanimous $contact ceases, then once the equanimous contact has ceased, the equani￾mous feeling that had arisen from the equanimous contact also ceases and $comes to an end; he knows it has become cool. 
$Monk, because of this or that contact there arises this or that feeling; $and once this or that contact has ceased, this or that feeling also ceases. 
$He knows that this feeling comes from contact, has its root in contact, $arises by way of contact, is born from contact, has contact as its beginning, $and proceeds in dependence on contact. 
$Monk, it is just as, conditioned by a lower firestick, an upper firestick, $and human effort, heat is produced and fire arises; but, monk, if the many $pieces of firewood are scattered, then any fire that arises from those [fire￾sticks]—fire that might have produced much heat if provided with much $fuel—will all cease and come to an end, leaving just cold firewood. 
$In the same way, monk, because of this or that contact there arises this $or that feeling. 
Once this or that contact has ceased, this or that feeling $also ceases. 
He knows that this feeling comes from contact, has its root $in contact, arises by way of contact, is born from contact, has contact as $its beginning, and proceeds in dependence on contact. 
$If a monk is not defiled by these three feelings but is liberated from $them, then that monk just dwells in equanimity which is extremely pure. 
$Monk, that monk reflects, “With this pure equanimity of mine, let me $enter the sphere of infinite space, developing the mind accordingly, in $dependence on that, dwelling in that, established on that, conditioned by $that, bound to that. 
With this pure equanimity of mine, let me enter the $sphere of infinite consciousness ...
the sphere of nothingness ...
the $sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception, developing the mind $accordingly, in dependence on that, dwelling in that, established on that, $conditioned by that, bound to that.” $Monk, he is just like a skilled goldsmith who uses fire to refine gold, $forging it so that it becomes extremely thin, heating it in the furnace in $various ways so that it becomes pure, extremely malleable, and bright. 
$311^taisho691c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Monk, once that gold has been heated and refined in various ways by $the goldsmith so that it becomes pure, extremely malleable, and bright, $that goldsmith fashions it according to his will into [gold thread for] $embroidery to adorn a new garment, or into a finger ring, an arm bracelet, $a necklace, or a jeweled hair ornament. 
$In the same way, monk, that monk reflects, “With this pure equanimity $of mine, I could enter the sphere of infinite space, and develop this mental $state in dependence on that, dwelling in that, established on that, conditioned $by that, bound to that. 
With this pure equanimity of mine, I could enter the $sphere of infinite consciousness ...
the sphere of nothingness ...
the sphere $of neither-perception-nor-nonperception, and develop this mental state in $dependence on that, dwelling in that, established on that, conditioned by $that, bound to that.” $That monk reflects further, “If this pure equanimity of mine were $dependent on the sphere of infinite space, then it would be conditioned. 
$What is conditioned, that is impermanent. 
What is impermanent, that is $dukkha. 
What is dukkha, I know as dukkha.” Having known it as dukkha, $he lets go of it and does not enter the sphere of infinite space. 
$[He reflects,] “If this pure equanimity of mine were based on the sphere $of infinite consciousness ...
the sphere of nothingness ...
the sphere of nei￾ther-perception-nor-nonperception, then it would be conditioned. 
What is $conditioned, that is impermanent. 
What is impermanent, that is dukkha. 
What $is dukkha, I know as dukkha.” Having known it as dukkha, he lets go of it $and does not enter the sphere of infinite consciousness ...
the sphere of noth￾ingness ...
the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception.320$Monk, if a monk, by wisely contemplating these four spheres, knows $them as they truly are, then his mind does not [wish to] attain them and does $not enter them. 
At that time he is no longer conditioned and has no intentions $in regard to becoming or nonbecoming. 
When he experiences the last feeling $to be experienced by the body,321 he will know that he is experiencing the $last feeling to be experienced by the body. 
When he experiences the last $feeling to be experienced in his life, he will know that he is experiencing the $last feeling to be experienced in his life. 
He knows that with the breaking $up of the body at the end of life, when the life span has been completed, all $feelings completely cease and come to an end, becoming cool. 
$312^taisho692a Division 13$Monk, it is just like a lamp that burns in dependence on oil and a wick. 
$If nobody adds oil and supplies a wick, then once what had earlier [been $supplied] comes to an end, the lamp does not continue [burning], having $no more fuel. 
$In the same way, when the monk experiences the last feeling to be expe￾rienced by the body, he will know that he is experiencing the last feeling $to be experienced by the body. 
When he experiences the last feeling to be $experienced in his life, he will know that he is experiencing the last feeling $to be experienced in his life. 
With the breaking up of the body at the end $of life, when the life span has been completed, all feelings completely $cease and come to an end. 
He knows that they have become cool. 
$Monk, this is reckoned the foremost right wisdom for a monk, namely $attaining supreme and complete cessation. 
A monk whose taints are $destroyed has attained this; he has attained the foremost sphere of right $wisdom. 
Monk, with this liberation he is established in truth and has $attained imperturbability. 
Truth is what is in accordance with the Dharma. 
$Falsehood is what has the nature of delusion. 
Monk, to attain that is the $foremost sphere of truth. 
$Monk, suppose that a monk is practicing relinquishment.322 Whereas $he formerly would certainly have harbored resentment, he has now let go $of that, vomited it out, become liberated from it, extinguished it completely. 
$Monk, this is reckoned a monk’s foremost right relinquishment, namely $the complete giving up of worldliness, its fading away, ceasing, and coming $to an end. 
A monk who achieves this achieves the foremost sphere of $relinquishment. 
$Monk, that monk’s mind [formerly] was defiled by sensual desire, ill $will, and stupidity, for he had not attained liberation. 
Monk, when all sen￾sual passion, anger, and stupidity end, [when they] fade away, cease, come $to an end, that is to attain the foremost peace. 
Monk, one who achieves $that achieves the foremost sphere of peace. 
$Monk, “I am” elevates oneself. 
“I shall be” also elevates oneself. 
“I $shall neither be nor not be” also elevates oneself. 
“I shall be endowed with $form” also elevates oneself. 
“I shall be formless” also elevates oneself. 
“I $shall be neither endowed with form nor formless” also elevates oneself. 
$“I shall be percipient” also elevates oneself. 
“I shall be nonpercipient” also $313$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$elevates oneself. 
“I shall be neither percipient nor non-percipient” also ele￾vates oneself. 
This is conceit; this is pride; this is negligence.323$Monk, if there is none of this self-elevation, conceit, pride, or negli￾gence, then the mind is reckoned to be at peace. 
Monk, if the mind is at $peace, then it does not dislike, is not sad, is not troubled, not agitated.324$Why is that? Because that monk has attained Dharma, there is no longer $what could be called dislike. 
Not disliking, he is not sad; not being sad, $he is not worried; not being worried, he is not troubled; not being troubled, $he is not agitated; and because of not being agitated he attains nirvana, $knowing as it really is: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, $what had to be done has been done, there will be not be another experi￾encing of existence.” $As this Dharma was being taught, there arose in the venerable Pukkusāti $the spotless, immaculate Dharma eye in regard to all phenomena.325 Then $the venerable Pukkusāti saw the Dharma, attained the Dharma, realized the $bright pure Dharma; he abandoned doubt and went beyond perplexity; he $became independent of other teachers; he would never again follow others; $and he became free of hesitation. 
Having been established in the attainment $of the fruit, he had attained fearlessness in the Dharma taught by the World￾honored One. 
$He rose from his seat, paid homage at the feet of the Buddha, and said, $World-honored One, I repent. 
Well-gone One, I confess. 
[I was] like a fool, $like an ignorant [person], like an uncertain [person], like one who does $not understand well and does not recognize good ground, unable to under￾stand on my own. 
Why is that? Because I addressed the Tathāgata, free $from attachment, fully awakened, as “sir.” May the World-honored One $accept my repentance. 
Having repented, I will not do it again. 
$The World-honored One said: $Monk, you truly were foolish and ignorant, you truly were uncertain. 
You $did not understand well in that you addressed the Tathāgata, free from $attachment, fully awakened, as “sir.” Monk, if you are able to repent on $your own, having seen it and disclosed it, and you guard against doing it $again, then, monk, in this way there is benefit and no loss in the noble $314^taisho692b Division 13$Dharma and discipline; that is to say, when one is able to repent on one’s $own, having seen it and disclosed it, and guards against doing it again.326$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the venerable $Pukkusāti was delighted and received it respectfully.

^ck The Discourse on an Analysis $of the Six Sense Spheres327$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī, staying $in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $I shall teach you the Dharma that is sublime in the beginning, sublime in $the middle, and also sublime in the end, with its meaning and phrasing, $endowed with purity, and revealing the holy life,328 namely a discourse $on an analysis of the six sense spheres. 
Listen closely, listen closely and $pay proper attention. 
$Then the monks replied, “Yes, World-honored One, we shall receive the $teaching.” $The Buddha said: $You should internally understand the six sense spheres. 
You should inter￾nally understand the six contacts.329 You should internally understand the $eighteen mental activities. 
You should internally understand the thirty￾six implements [of experience].330 Herein, abandoning that, accomplish $this. 
[You] should internally understand that the teaching of the Dharma $is infinite. 
There are three establishments of mindfulness developed by $the Noble One, having developed which the Noble One is capable of $teaching the assemblies, as an unsurpassable trainer who trains people to $advance in any direction. 
These are the topics of this discourse on an $analysis of the six sense spheres. 
$“The six sense spheres should be internally understood”—why has $this been said? There are the eye sense sphere, the ear ...
nose ...
$tongue ...
body and mind sense sphere. 
“The six sense spheres should $be internally understood”—this has been said for this reason. 
$315^taisho692c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$“The six contacts should be internally understood”—why has this been $said? There is eye contact on seeing forms, ear contact on hearing sounds, $nose contact on smelling odors, tongue contact on tasting flavors, body $contact on touching tangibles, and mind contact on cognizing mind $objects.331 “The six contacts should be internally understood”—this has $been said for this reason. 
$“The eighteen mental activities should be internally understood”—$why has this been said? Monks, having seen a form with the eye, one dis￾cerns the form and abides in joy, [or] one discerns the form and abides in $sadness, [or] one discerns the form and abides in equanimity. 
In the same $way with the ear ...
nose ...
tongue ...
body ...
having cognized a $mental object with the mind, one discerns the mental object and abides $in joy, [or] one discerns the mental object and abides in sadness, [or] one $discerns the mental object and abides in equanimity. 
This is reckoned as $discerning six [types] of joy, discerning six [types] of sadness, discerning $six [types] of equanimity. 
These are collectively called the eighteen mental $activities. 
“The eighteen mental activities should be internally under￾stood”—this has been said for this reason. 
$“The thirty-six implements [of experience] should be internally under￾stood”—why has this been said? There are six [types] of joy that are based $on attachment, six [types] of joy that are based on dispassion, six [types] $of sadness that are based on attachment, six [types] of sadness that are $based on dispassion, six [types] of equanimity that are based on attachment, $and six [types] of equanimity that are based on dispassion. 
$What are the six [types] of joy that are based on attachment and what $are the six [types] of joy that are based on dispassion? The eye having $seen a form, there arises joy. 
One should know that this [can be] of two $types, either based on attachment or based on dispassion. 
$What is joy based on attachment? The eye comes to know forms that are $conducive to joy and the mind reflects on them, desiring those forms, expe￾riencing happiness conjoined with desire. 
Those [forms] which one has not $gotten, one desires to get; those which one has already gotten are recollected $and give rise to joy. 
Joy of this type is called joy based on attachment. 
$What is joy based on dispassion? One understands that forms are imper￾manent, changing, [bound to] disappear, fade away, and cease; that all $316$Division 13$forms, both formerly and in the present, are impermanent, dukkha, and $bound to cease. 
Recollecting this gives rise to joy. 
Joy of this type is called $joy based on dispassion.332$In the same way the ear ...

Those $[mental objects] which one has not yet got, one desires to get; those which $one has already got are recollected and give rise to joy. 
Joy of this type $is called joy based on attachment. 
$What is joy based on dispassion? One understands that mental objects $are impermanent, changing, [bound to] disappear, to fade away and cease; $that all mental objects, both formerly and in the present, are impermanent, $dukkha, and bound to cease.

$What is sadness based on attachment? The eye comes to know forms $that are conducive to joy and the mind reflects on them, desiring those $forms, experiencing happiness conjoined with desire. 
Those [forms] which $one has not yet got, one is not able to get; those which one has already $got are [soon] past and gone, scattered and decayed, having ceased or $changed, which gives rise to sadness. 
Sadness of this type is called sadness $based on attachment. 
$What is sadness based on dispassion? One understands that forms are $impermanent, changing, [bound to] disappear, to fade away and cease; $that all forms, both formerly and in the present, are impermanent, dukkha,$and bound to cease. 
$Recollecting this, one reflects, “When will I attain and dwell in that $sphere, namely the sphere that the noble ones attain and dwell in?” This $317^taisho693a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$is [one’s] aspiration for the highest liberation.

That is the indifference [of one] who $is not learned, who lacks wisdom, an unlearned ignorant worldling. 
Such $equanimity toward form is not detached from form. 
This is called equa￾nimity based on attachment. 
$What is equanimity based on dispassion? One understands that forms $are impermanent, changing, [bound to] disappear, to fade away and cease; $that all forms, both formerly and in the present, are impermanent, dukkha,$318^taisho693b Division 13$and bound to cease.

$“Herein, abandoning that, accomplish this!”—why has this been said? $By holding to the six [types] of joy that are based on dispassion, by depend￾ing on them and dwelling in them, extinguish the six [types] of joy that $are based on attachment, remove them, vomit them out. 
In this way they $are to be eradicated.

$There is equanimity that is of countless contacts, diverse contacts, and $there is equanimity that is of a single contact, not of diverse contacts. 
$What is equanimity that is of countless contacts, diverse contacts? Equa￾nimity in regard to forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles—this is equa￾nimity that is of countless contacts, diverse contacts. 
$What is equanimity that is of a single contact, not of diverse contacts? $This is equanimity that depends on the sphere of infinite space, or on the $sphere of infinite consciousness, or on the sphere of nothingness, or on $the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception—this is equanimity $that is of a single contact, not of diverse contacts.

$Holding to boundlessness, depending on boundlessness, and dwelling $in boundlessness—this is reckoned as the type of equanimity that is of a $single contact, not of diverse contacts.

$320^taisho693c Division 13$“One should internally understand that the teaching of the Dharma is $infinite”—why has this been said?336 [Suppose that] the Tathāgata had $four disciples who were of superior conduct, superior understanding, supe￾rior mindfulness, and superior wisdom, who were skilled in eloquence, $having achieved foremost skill in eloquence, and had a life span of a hun￾dred years. 
The Tathāgata could teach them the Dharma for one hundred $years continuously—except for the time [required] for eating and drinking, $the time for obeying the calls of nature, the time for resting when weary, $and the time for [Sangha] meetings— and they would quickly see, with $wisdom, the meaning of the Dharma taught by the Tathāgata, as regards $wording, phrasing, and import, without needing to ask the Tathāgata further $questions about the Dharma. 
Why is that? [Because] the Tathāgata’s teach￾ing of the Dharma is without limit and could not be exhausted, as regards $wording, phrasing, and import, before the lives of those four disciples $would come to an end. 
$They would be just like four skilled archers, well trained, knowledge￾able, and endowed with energy, who, powerfully shooting [their arrows], $immediately penetrate [the target]. 
$In the same way, [suppose that] the Tathāgata had four disciples who $were of superior conduct, superior understanding, superior mindfulness, $and superior wisdom, who were skilled in eloquence, having achieved $foremost skill in eloquence, and had a life span of a hundred years. 
The $Tathāgata could teach them the Dharma [even] for one hundred years con￾tinuously—except for the time [required] for eating and drinking, the time $for obeying the calls of nature, the time for resting when weary, and the $time for [Sangha] meetings— and they would quickly see, with wisdom, $the meaning of the Dharma taught by the Tathāgata, as regards wording, $phrasing, and import, without needing to ask the Tathāgata further questions $about the Dharma. 
Why is that? [Because] the Tathāgata’s teaching of the $Dharma is without limit and could not be exhausted. 
“One should internally $understand that the teaching of the Dharma is infinite”—this has been $said for this reason. 
$“[There are] three establishments of mindfulness that are developed $by the Noble One, having developed which the Noble One is capable of $321$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$teaching the assemblies”—why has this been said? The Tathāgata teaches $the Dharma to his disciples with thoughts of sympathy and consideration, $seeking their benefit and welfare, seeking their peace and happiness, with $a mind full of compassion and kindness, [telling them,] “This is for your $welfare, this is for your happiness, this is for your welfare and happiness.” $If those disciples are not respectful and do not act accordingly, not $becoming established in knowledge, their minds not progressing in the $Dharma, not following the Dharma, not receiving the true Dharma, dis￾regarding the World-honored One’s instruction, and unable to attain cer￾tainty in it; then the World-honored One is not sad or sorrowful because $of this.337 Instead, the World-honored One is equanimous and unaffected, $constantly mindful and constantly aware. 
This is reckoned the first estab￾lishment of mindfulness that is developed by the Noble One, such that, $having developed it, the Noble One is capable of teaching the assemblies. 
$Again, the Tathāgata teaches the Dharma to his disciples with thoughts $of sympathy and consideration, seeking their benefit and welfare, seeking $their peace and happiness, with a mind full of compassion and kindness, $[telling them,] “This is for your welfare, this is for your happiness, this $is for your welfare and happiness.” $If the disciples are respectful and act accordingly, becoming established $in knowledge, their minds surrendering and progressing in the Dharma, $following the Dharma, receiving the true Dharma, not disregarding the $World-honored One’s instruction and able to attain certainty in it; then $the World-honored One is not glad or joyful because of this.338 Instead, $the World-honored One is equanimous and unaffected, constantly mindful $and constantly aware. 
This is reckoned the second establishment of mind￾fulness that is developed by the Noble One, such that, having developed $it, the Noble One is capable of teaching the assemblies. 
$Again, the Tathāgata teaches the Dharma to his disciples with thoughts $of sympathy and consideration, seeking their benefit and welfare, seeking $their peace and happiness, with a mind full of compassion and kindness, $[telling them,] “This is for your welfare, this is for your happiness, this $is for your welfare and happiness.” $Some disciples are not respectful and do not act accordingly, not becom￾ing established in knowledge, their minds not progressing in the Dharma, $322^taisho694a Division 13$not following the Dharma, not receiving the true Dharma, disregarding $the World-honored One’s instruction, and unable to attain certainty in it. 
$Some disciples are respectful and act accordingly, becoming established $in knowledge, their minds surrendering to and progressing in the Dharma, $following the Dharma, receiving the true Dharma, not disregarding the $World-honored One’s instruction, and able to attain certainty in it; the $World-honored One is not sad or sorrowful because of this, nor is he glad $or joyful. 
Instead, the World-honored One is equanimous and unaffected, $constantly mindful and constantly aware. 
$This is reckoned the third establishment of mindfulness that is developed $by the Noble One, such that, having developed it, the Noble One is capable $of teaching the assemblies. 
“There are three establishments of mindfulness $that are developed by the Noble One, such that, having developed them, $the Noble One is capable of teaching the assemblies”—this has been said $for this reason. 
$“The unsurpassable trainer of able men trains able men to advance in $any direction”—why has this been said? “Trainer of able men”: this is $said of one who trains able men to advance in a certain direction: the $eastern direction, or the southern direction, or the western direction, or $the northern direction. 
$A trainer of elephants trains elephants to advance in a certain direction: $the eastern direction, or the southern direction, or the western direction, $or the northern direction.

$The unsurpassable trainer of able men trains able men to advance in $any direction.

$Thus spoke the Buddha.

^ck The Discourse on an Analytical $Contemplation of Dharmas339$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī, staying $in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $I shall teach you the Dharma that is sublime in the beginning, sublime in $the middle, and also sublime in the end, with its meaning and phrasing, $endowed with purity, and revealing the holy life,340 namely a discourse $on an analytical contemplation of dharmas. 
Listen closely, listen closely $and pay proper attention. 
$Then the monks replied, “Yes, World-honored One, we shall receive the $teaching.” $324$Division 13$The Buddha said: $Monks, one may keep contemplating in such and such a way. 
Monks, $having contemplated like this, the mind moves outward and becomes scat￾tered—the mind is not settled within; and through <clinging> it becomes $agitated.341 [On the other hand,] monks, one may keep contemplating in $such and such a way. 
Monks, having contemplated like that, the mind $does not move outward and does not become scattered—the mind is settled $within;342 and through not clinging it does not become agitated. 
In this $way there will be no further birth, old age, disease, and death. 
This is $called the end of dukkha. 
$Having spoken thus, the Buddha rose from his seat and entered his dwelling $to sit in meditation. 
$Then the monks had this thought: “Venerable friends, it should be known that $the World-honored One has risen from his seat and entered his dwelling to sit in $meditation, having spoken about this matter in brief, without explaining its details, $[namely:] ‘Monks, one may keep contemplating in such and such a way. 
Monks, $having contemplated like this, the mind moves outward and becomes scattered—$the mind is not settled within; and through <clinging> it becomes agitated. 
[On $the other hand,] monks, one may keep contemplating in such and such a way. 
$Monks, having contemplated like that, the mind does not move outward and $does not become scattered—the mind is settled within; and through not clinging $it does not become agitated. 
In this way there will be no further birth, old age, 694c disease, and death. 
This is called the end of dukkha.”’ $They further had this thought: “Venerable friends, who would be able to $explain in detail the meaning of what the World-honored One has just said $in brief?” They further had this thought: “The venerable Mahākaccāna is $often praised by the World-honored One and by his wise companions in the $holy life. 
The venerable Mahākaccāna would be able to explain in detail the $meaning of what the World-honored One has just said in brief. 
Venerable $friends, let us together approach the venerable Mahākaccāna and request $him to explain this matter. 
As the venerable Mahākaccāna explains it, so we $should remember it well.” $Then the monks approached the venerable Mahākaccāna. 
Having exchanged $greetings, stepped back, and sat to one side, they said: $325$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Venerable Mahākaccāna, please know that the World-honored One rose $from his seat and entered his dwelling to sit in meditation, having spoken $on this matter in brief without explaining the details, [namely:] “Monks, $one may keep contemplating in such and such a way. 
Monks, having con￾templated like this, the mind moves outward and becomes scattered—the $mind is not settled within; and by <clinging> it becomes agitated. 
[On the $other hand,] monks, one may keep contemplating in such and such a way. 
$Monks, having contemplated like that, the mind does not move outward $and does not become scattered—the mind is settled within; and by not cling￾ing it does not become agitated. 
In this way there will be no further birth, $old age, disease, and death. 
This is called the end of dukkha.” $Then we had this thought: “Venerable friends, who would be able to $explain in detail the meaning of what the World-honored One has just said $in brief?” We further had this thought: “The venerable Mahākaccāna is $often praised by the World-honored One and by his wise companions in $the holy life. 
The venerable Mahākaccāna would be able to explain in detail $the meaning of what the World-honored One has just said in brief.” May $the venerable Mahākaccāna teach us in detail, out of compassion! $Then the venerable Mahākaccāna said: $Venerable friends, listen while I tell you a simile. 
On hearing a simile $wise people understand the meaning. 
Venerable friends, it is as if there $were a man wishing to search for heartwood. 
In search of heartwood, he $enters the forest, carrying an ax. 
He sees a great tree possessed of roots, $branches, joints, twigs, leaves, flowers, and heartwood. 
That man does $not take hold of the roots, branches, joints, and heartwood, but only takes $hold of the twigs and leaves. 
$Venerable friends, what you have said is just like this. 
The World-hon￾ored One was present, yet you have left him and come to ask me about $this matter. 
Why is that? Venerable friends, know this: The World-honored $One is the eye, is knowledge, is meaning, is the Dharma, is the master of $the Dharma, is the general of the Dharma. 
The teaching of the true meaning, $the revelation of all meaning comes from the World-honored One. 
Ven￾erable friends, you should have approached the World-honored One himself $to ask about this matter, saying: “World-honored One, how is this? What $326$Division 13$is the meaning of this?” As the World-honored One explained it, so, ven￾erable friends, you should have remembered it well. 
$Then the monks said: $Yes, indeed, venerable Mahākaccāna, the World-honored One is the eye, $is knowledge, is meaning, is the Dharma, is the master of the Dharma, is $the general of the Dharma. 
The teaching of the true meaning, the revelation $of all meaning comes from the World-honored One. 
We should have $approached the World-honored One to ask about this matter, saying: “World￾honored One, how is this? What is the meaning of this?” As the World￾honored One explained it, so we should have remembered it well. 
$However, the venerable Mahākaccāna is often praised by the World￾honored One and by his wise companions in the holy life. 
The venerable $Mahākaccāna will be able to explain in detail the meaning of what the $World-honored One said in brief. 
May the venerable Mahākaccāna explain $it in detail, out of compassion! $The venerable Mahākaccāna said to the monks: $Venerable friends, listen together to what I shall say. 
Venerable friends, $how does a monk’s mind move outward and become scattered? $Venerable friends, a monk sees a form with the eye and his conscious￾ness feeds on the characteristics of that form, his consciousness becomes $attached to the pleasurable characteristics of that form, his consciousness $becomes shackled to the pleasurable characteristics of that form. 
Being $in bondage to the gratification [derived from] the characteristics of that $form, his mind moves outward and becomes scattered.

Venerable friends, approach the Buddha and set $out [my explanation] in full [to him]. 
As the World-honored One explains $its meaning, venerable friends, remember it. 
$Then, having heard what the venerable Mahākaccāna had said, bearing well $in mind [how] to recite it, the monks rose from their seats, circumambulated $the venerable Mahākaccāna three times, and left. 
They approached the Buddha. 
$Having paid homage to him, they stepped back, sat to one side, and said: $World-honored One, the instruction that the World-honored One gave in $brief without explaining its meaning in detail, after which he rose from his $seat and entered his dwelling to sit in meditation—the venerable Mahā-$kaccāna has explained it to us in detail employing these phrases and words. 
$Having heard it, the World-honored One expressed praise: $It is well, it is well, my disciple is endowed with the eye, with knowledge, $with Dharma, with meaning. 
Why is that? [Because] in regard to this $matter which the teacher taught to the disciples in brief, without explaining $its details, that disciple has taught it in detail employing these phrases $and words. 
You should remember it like this, [just] as the monk Mahā -$kaccāna has taught it.

^ck The Discourse on a Deva at the Hot Spring Grove346$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Rājagaha, staying $in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. 
$334$Division 13$At that time the venerable Samiddhi was also dwelling at Rājagaha, staying $in the Hot Spring Grove. 
When the night was over, toward dawn, the venerable 696c$Samiddhi left his dwelling and approached the hot spring. 
Taking off his robes $and [leaving] them on the bank, he entered the hot spring to bathe. 
Having $bathed, he came out again, wiped his body [dry], and put on his robes. 
$Then, the night being over, toward dawn, a deva of fine physique and $majestic appearance approached the venerable Samiddhi, paid homage with $the head, stepped back, and stood to one side. 
The excellent splendor of that $deva’s appearance brilliantly illuminated the bank of the hot spring. 
Having $stepped back and stood to one side, that deva said to the venerable Samiddhi, $“Monk, do you remember the verses on an auspicious night?”347$The venerable Samiddhi replied to that deva, “I do not remember the $verses on an auspicious night.” He [then] asked the deva, “Do you remember $the verses on an auspicious night?” $The deva replied, “I too do not remember the verses on an auspicious night.” $The venerable Samiddhi asked the deva further, “Who does remember $the verses on an auspicious night?”348$The deva answered: $The World-honored One is dwelling here at Rājagaha, staying in the Bam￾boo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. 
He will remember the verses on an $auspicious night. 
$Monk, approach the World-honored One and from him memorize well $the verses on an auspicious night and recite them. 
Why is that? [Because] $the verses on an auspicious night pertain to the Teaching; they pertain to $what is beneficial. 
They are the root of the holy life, leading to knowledge, $to realization, and to nirvana. 
$[As] a son of good family who, out of faith, has left the household life $to become homeless and practice the path [you] should memorize well $the verses on an auspicious night and recite them. 
$Having spoken in this way, that deva paid homage with the head at the $feet of the venerable Samiddhi and, having circumambulated him three times, $vanished on the spot. 
$Then, not long after the deva had vanished, the venerable Samiddhi $approached the Buddha. 
Having paid homage with his head, he stepped back, $sat to one side, and said: $335$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$World-honored One, today, when the night was over, toward dawn, I left $my dwelling and approached the hot spring. 
I took off my robes and, $[leaving] them on the bank, entered the hot spring to bathe. 
Having bathed, $I came out and stood on the bank wiping my body [dry]. 
$At that time, the night being over, toward dawn, a deva of fine physique $and majestic appearance approached me, paid homage with the head, $stepped back, and stood to one side. 
The excellent splendor of that deva’s $appearance brilliantly illuminated the bank of the hot spring. 
Having $stepped back and stood to one side, that deva said to me, “Monk, do you $remember the verses on an auspicious night?” $I replied to that deva, “I do not remember the verses on an auspicious $night.” [Then] I asked the deva, “Do you remember the verses on an aus￾picious night?” $The deva replied, “I too do not remember the verses on an auspicious $night.” $I asked [the deva] further, “Who does remember the verses on an aus￾picious night?” $The deva answered, “The World-honored One is dwelling here at Rāja￾gaha, staying in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.

$The World-honored One asked, “Samiddhi, do you know that deva’s name $and where he came from?” $The venerable Samiddhi replied, “World-honored One, I do not know that $deva’s name and I also do not know where he came from.” $336^taisho697a Division 13$The World-honored One said, “Samiddhi, that deva is called Main Hall $and he is a general in the army of the devas of the Thirty-three.”349$Then the venerable Samiddhi said: $World-honored One, now is the right time. 
Well-gone One, now is the $right time for the World-honored One to teach the monks the verses on $an auspicious night. 
Having heard them from the World-honored One, $the monks will remember them well. 
$The World-honored One said, “Samiddhi, listen closely. 
Listen closely $and pay proper attention to what I shall teach you.” $The venerable Samiddhi said, “Yes, indeed.” $Then all the monks listened to receive instruction. 
The Buddha said: $Be careful not to think about the past, $And do not long for the future. 
$Matters of the past have already ceased, $And the future has not yet arrived. 
$Phenomena in the present $Are what one should contemplate,350$Mindful of [their] lack of stability.

$Having spoken in this way, the Buddha rose from his seat and entered his $dwelling to sit in meditation. 
$Then the monks had this thought: “Venerable friends, you should know $that the World-honored One has risen from his seat and entered his dwelling $337$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$to sit in meditation, having given this instruction in brief, without explaining $its details, [namely]: $“Be careful not to think about the past, $And do not long for the future.

$“Venerable friends, let us together approach the venerable Mahākaccāna $and request him to explain its meaning.

Having exchanged $greetings with him, they stepped back, sat to one side, and said: $Venerable Mahākaccāna, please know this. 
The World-honored One rose $from his seat and entered his dwelling to sit in meditation, after giving $this instruction in brief, without explaining its details, [namely:] $338^taisho697b Division 13$Be careful not to think about the past, $And do not long for the future.

$339^taisho697c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Venerable friends, what you have said is just like that. 
The World-hon￾ored One was present, yet you left him to come and ask me about this $matter. 
Why is that? $Venerable friends, know this: the World-honored One is the eye, is $knowledge, is meaning, is the Dharma, is the master of the Dharma, is $the general of the Dharma. 
The teaching of the true meaning, the revelation $of all meaning, comes from the World-honored One. 
$Venerable friends, you should have approached the World-honored $One to ask him about this matter, [saying,] “World-honored One, how is $this? What is the meaning of this?” As the World-honored One explained $it, venerable friends, so you should have remembered it well. 
$Then the monks said: $Yes, indeed, venerable Mahākaccāna.

$Venerable friends, the World-honored One rose from his seat and entered $his dwelling to sit in meditation, after giving this instruction in brief $without explaining the details, [namely:] $Be careful not to think about the past, $And do not long for the future.

$343$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$This brief instruction that the World-honored One gave without explaining $its details I have explained in detail in this way, employing these phrases $and words. 
Venerable friends, approach the Buddha and set out [my expla￾nation] in full [to him]. 
As the World-honored One explains its meaning, $venerable friends, you can together remember it. 
$Then, having heard the venerable Mahākaccāna’s explanation, the monks, $having well memorized [how] to recite it, rose from their seats, circumambulated $the venerable Mahākaccāna three times, and left. 
Approaching the Buddha, they $paid homage with their heads, stepped back, sat to one side, and said: $World-honored One, the instruction that the World-honored One gave in $brief without analyzing the meaning in detail, after which he rose from $his seat and entered his dwelling to sit in meditation, the venerable $Mahākaccāna has explained in detail employing these phrases and words. 
$Having heard it, the World-honored One expressed praise: $It is well, it is well, my disciple is endowed with the eye, with knowledge, $with meaning, with Dharma. 
Why is that? $[Because] in regard to this instruction, which the teacher taught to the $disciples in brief, without explaining its details, that disciple has explained $it in detail employing these phrases and words.

^ck The Discourse on a Venerable One $in a Meditation Hut among $the Sakyans354$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī, staying $in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the venerable Lomasakaṅgiya was dwelling among the $Sakyans in a meditation hut in a forest. 
Then, the night being over, toward $dawn, the venerable Lomasakaṅgiya came out of his meditation hut, spread $344^taisho698c Division 13$his sitting mat on a rope bed that was on open ground in the shade of the $meditation hut, and sat down [on it] cross-legged. 
$Then, the night being over, toward dawn, a deva of fine physique and $majestic appearance approached the venerable Lomasakaṅgiya. 
He paid hom￾age with the head, stepped back, and stood to one side. 
The excellent splendor $of that deva brilliantly illuminated the whole meditation hut. 
Standing there $on one side, the deva addressed the venerable Lomasakaṅgiya, “Monk, do $you remember the verses on an auspicious night and their meaning?”355$The venerable Lomasakaṅgiya replied to the deva, “I do not remember $the verses on an auspicious night nor do I remember their meaning.” He $[then] asked the deva, “Do you remember the verses on an auspicious night $and their meaning?” $That deva replied, “I remember the verses on an auspicious night but not $their meaning.” $The venerable Lomasakaṅgiya asked the deva further, “How is it that you $remember the verses on an auspicious night but not their meaning?” $The deva replied: $At one time the World-honored One was dwelling at Rājagaha, staying $in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.356 At that time the World￾honored One taught the monks the verses on an auspicious night [thus]: $Be careful not to think about the past, $And do not long for the future. 
$Matters of the past have already ceased, $And the future has not yet arrived. 
$Phenomena in the present $Are what one should contemplate,357$Mindful of [their] lack of stability.

$Monk, in this way I remember the verses on an auspicious night, but not $their meaning. 
$The venerable Lomasakaṅgiya asked the deva further, “Who remembers $the verses on an auspicious night and also their meaning?”358$The deva answered: $The World-honored One is dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anātha -$piṇḍika’s Park. 
He will remember the verses on an auspicious night and $also their meaning. 
Monk, approach the World-honored One and from $him memorize well the verses on an auspicious night and also their mean￾ing, and recite them. 
Why is that? $[Because] the verses on an auspicious night and their meaning pertain $to the Teaching; they pertain to what is beneficial. 
Being the root of the $holy life, they lead to knowledge, to realization, and to nirvana. 
[As] a $son of good family who, out of faith, has left the household life to become $homeless and practice the path, [you] should memorize well the verses $on an auspicious night and also their meaning, and recite them. 
$Having spoken like this, that deva paid homage with the head at the feet $of the venerable Lomasakaṅgiya and, having circumambulated him three $times, vanished on the spot. 
$Then, not long after the deva had vanished, the venerable Lomasakaṅgiya, $having completed the rains retreat among the Sakyans,359 the three months $being over, having mended his robes, took his robes and bowl and headed $for Sāvatthī. 
Traveling by stages he reached Sāvatthī, where he stayed at $Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the venerable Lomasakaṅgiya approached the Buddha. 
Having $paid homage with his head, he stepped back, sat to one side, and said: $Blessed One, at one time I was dwelling among the Sakyans, in a medi￾tation hut in a forest. 
Blessed One, then, the night being over, toward $346^taisho699a Division 13$dawn, I came out of a meditation hut, spread my sitting mat on a rope bed $that was on open ground in the shade of the meditation hut, and sat down $on it cross-legged.

$At that time the venerable Ānanda was teaching the monks, who had gath￾ered at night in the assembly hall, the verses on an auspicious night and their $meaning. 
$Then, when the night was over, toward dawn, a certain monk approached $the Buddha. 
Having paid homage with his head, he stepped back, sat to one $side, and said: $World-honored One, the venerable Ānanda taught the monks, who had $gathered at night in the assembly hall, the verses on an auspicious night $and also their meaning.362$350^taisho700a Division 13$Then the World-honored One told a certain monk, “Go to the monk Ānanda $and say this, ‘Ānanda, the World-honored One summons you.’” $That monk, on receiving the World-honored One’s instruction, rose from $his seat, paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated $him three times, and left.

^ck The Discourse on Mental Practice366$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$353$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $I shall now teach you the Dharma that is sublime in the beginning, sublime $in the middle, and also sublime in the end, with its meaning and phrasing $endowed with purity and revealing the holy life. 
Called the “Discourse $on an Analysis of Mental Practice,” it is on rebirth according to mental $practice. 
Listen closely. 
Listen closely and pay proper attention. 
$Then the monks listened to receive the instruction. 
$The Buddha said: $What is rebirth according to mental practice? Suppose that a monk, secluded $from sensual desires, secluded from evil and unwholesome states, with $[directed] awareness and [sustained] contemplation, with rapture and hap￾piness born of seclusion, dwells having attained the first absorption. 
He $delights in this state of concentration, desires it, and is established in it. 
$Since he delights in this state of concentration, desires it, and is estab￾lished in it, it is certainly possible that, delighting in it and being established $in it, he will at death be reborn among the Brahmā devas. 
$The Brahmā devas, who are born there and established there, experience $rapture and happiness born of seclusion, [just] as a monk here who becomes $established on entering the first absorption experiences rapture and hap￾piness born of seclusion. 
These two [instances of] rapture and happiness $born of seclusion are not different; the two are completely equal. 
Why is $that? [Because] one who first practices this state of concentration here $will later be reborn there. 
He develops this state of concentration like this, $practices it like this, extends it like this. 
Such is rebirth among the Brahmā$devas; it is rebirth according to mental practice. 
$Again, with the calming of [directed] awareness and [sustained] con￾templation, with inner stillness and mental unification, without [directed] $awareness and [sustained] contemplation, with rapture and happiness born $of concentration, a monk dwells having attained the second absorption. 
He $delights in this state of concentration, desires it, and is established in it. 
$Since he delights in this state of concentration, desires it, and is estab￾lished in it, it is certainly possible that, delighting in it and being established $in it, he will at death be reborn among the devas of Streaming Radiance $(ābhassarā-devā). 
$354^taisho700c Division 13$The devas of Streaming Radiance, who are born there and established $there, experience rapture and happiness born of concentration, [just] as a $monk here who becomes established on entering the second absorption $experiences rapture and happiness born of concentration.

He develops $this state of concentration like this, practices it like this, extends it like $this. 
Such is rebirth among the devas of Streaming Radiance; it is rebirth $according to mental practice. 
$Again, secluded from rapture and pleasure, dwelling in equanimity, $not seeking anything, with right mindfulness and right comprehension, $experiencing happiness with the body, a monk dwells having attained the $third absorption, which the noble ones speak of as noble equanimity and $mindfulness, a happy abode. 
He delights in this state of concentration, $desires it, and is established in it. 
$Since he delights in this state of concentration, desires it, and is estab￾lished in it, it is certainly possible that, delighting in it and being established $in it, he will at death be reborn among the devas of Refulgent Glory (subha -$kiṇṇā-devā).

$Again, with the cessation of pleasure and the cessation of pain, and $with the earlier cessation of joy and displeasure, with neither-pain-nor￾pleasure, with equanimity, mindfulness, and purity, a monk dwells, having $attained the fourth absorption. 
He delights in this state of concentration, $desires it, and is established in it. 
$355$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Since he delights in this state of concentration, desires it, and is estab￾lished in it, it is certainly possible that, delighting in it and being established $in it, he will at death be reborn among the devas of Great Reward (ve -$happha lā-devā).

He develops this state of concentration like this, practices it like $this, extends it like this. 
Such is rebirth among the devas of Great Reward; $it is rebirth according to mental practice. 
$Again, by completely transcending perceptions of form, with the ces￾sation of perceptions of sensory impact, not aware of perceptions of diver￾sity, [aware] of infinite space, a monk dwells having attained the sphere $of infinite space. 
He delights in this state of concentration, desires it, and $is established in it.

Such is rebirth among the devas of the sphere 701b of nothingness; it is rebirth according to mental practice. 
$Again, by completely transcending the perception of the sphere of noth￾ingness, [aware] of neither-perception-nor-nonperception, a monk dwells $having attained the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception. 
He $delights in this state of concentration, desires it, and is established in it. 
$Since he delights in this state of concentration, desires it, and is estab￾lished in it, it is certainly possible that, delighting in it and being established $357$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$in it, he will at death be reborn among the devas of the sphere of neither￾perception-nor-nonperception. 
$The devas of the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception, who $are born there and established there, experience the perception of the sphere $of neither-perception-nor-nonperception, [just as] a monk here who is estab￾lished in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception experiences $the perception of it. 
These two [instances of] the perception of it are not $different; the two are completely equal. 
Why is that? [Because] one who $first practices this state of concentration here will later be reborn there. 
He $develops that state of concentration like this, practices it like this, extends $it like this. 
Such is rebirth among the devas of the sphere of neither-percep￾tion-nor-nonperception; it is rebirth according to mental practice. 
$Again, by completely transcending the perception of the sphere of nei￾ther-perception-nor-nonperception, a monk dwells knowing cessation. 
$Having directly experienced it, by seeing with wisdom all his taints are $destroyed and he has knowledge of their elimination. 
Among all these $states of concentration, this one is reckoned supreme, the greatest, the $highest, the best, the most excellent. 
$It is just as from the cow comes milk, from milk comes cream, from $cream comes butter, from butter comes ghee, and from ghee comes cream $of ghee; and [among these] cream of ghee is reckoned supreme, the great￾est, the highest, the best, the most excellent. 
$In the same way, among all these states of concentrations, this one is $reckoned supreme, the greatest, the highest, the best, the most excellent. 
$Having attained this state of concentration, being based on this state of $concentration, having become established in this state of concentration, $one will no longer experience the dukkha of birth, old age, disease, and $death. 
This is reckoned as the end of dukkha.$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, those monks $were delighted and received it respectfully. 
$169. 
^ck The Discourse [Spoken among] $the Kurus on Nonconflict367$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was dwelling among the Bhaggās,368$staying at Kammāsadhamma, a Kuru town. 
$358$Division 13$At that time the World-honored One told the monks: $I shall teach you the Dharma that is sublime in the beginning, sublime in $the middle, and also sublime in the end, with its meaning and phrasing, $endowed with purity, and revealing the holy life.369 It is called the “Dis￾course on Analysis of Nonconflict.” Listen closely. 
Listen closely and pay $proper attention. 
$Then the monks listened to receive the teaching. 
$The Buddha said: $Do not seek sensual pleasure, which is an extremely degrading activity $engaged in by ordinary worldlings; also do not seek self-mortification, $which leads to suffering, is not the practice of noble ones, and is not con￾nected to what is beneficial. 
Avoiding these two extremes is the middle $way for attaining vision, for attaining knowledge, for naturally attaining $stillness, which leads to knowledge, to awakening, to nirvana. 
$There is praising, there is blaming, and there is neither-praising-nor￾blaming, which is teaching the Dharma. 
Be committed to evenness and, $having commitment and understanding, constantly seek happiness within. 
$Do not speak in an insinuating manner and also do not praise [someone] $to [their] face. 
Speak in an even and restrained manner; do not speak in $an uneven and unrestrained manner.370$Follow local customs, neither insisting on them nor rejecting them. 
This $is the subject matter of this “Discourse on an Analysis of Nonconflict.” $“Do not seek sensual pleasures, which is an extremely degrading activity $engaged in by ordinary worldlings; but also do not seek self-mortification, $which leads to suffering, is not a practice of noble ones and is not connected $to what is beneficial”—why was this said? $“Do not seek sensual pleasures, which is an extremely degrading activity $engaged in by ordinary worldlings”—this describes one extreme; “also $do not seek self-mortification, which leads to suffering, is not a practice $of noble ones, and is not connected to what is beneficial”—this describes $the second extreme.371$“Do not seek sensual pleasures, which is an extremely degrading activity $engaged in by ordinary worldlings; and also do not seek self-mortification, $359^taisho701c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$which leads to suffering, is not a practice of noble ones, and is not con￾nected to what is beneficial”—this has been said for this reason. 
$“Avoiding these two extremes is the middle way for attaining vision, $for attaining knowledge, for naturally attaining stillness, which leads to $knowledge, to awakening, to nirvana”—why has this been said? There is $this noble eightfold path: right view ...
up to ...
right concentration; $these are the eight. 
“Avoiding these two extremes is the middle way for $attaining vision, for attaining knowledge, for naturally attaining stillness, $which leads to knowledge, to awakening, to nirvana”—this has been said $for this reason. 
$“There is praising, there is blaming, and there is neither praising nor $blaming, which is teaching the Dharma”—why has this been said? What $is praising? What is blaming and [what is] not teaching the Dharma? $[Seeking] joy and happiness connected with sensual pleasure is an $extremely degrading activity engaged in by ordinary worldlings. 
It is a state $beset by suffering, vexation, trouble, and sadness; it is wrong practice. 
$Having come to know this, one blames [such practitioners] personally. 
Why $is that? [One thinks,] “Sensual pleasures are impermanent, dukkha, of a $nature to wear away.” Knowing that sensual pleasures are impermanent, $[one thinks,] “Therefore those [who engage in them] are entirely beset by $suffering, vexation, trouble, and sadness; such people are practicing wrongly.” $Having come to know this, one therefore blames them personally. 
$Self-mortification which leads to suffering is not a practice of noble $ones and is not connected to what is beneficial. 
It is a state beset by suffering, $vexation, trouble, and sadness; it is wrong practice. 
Having come to know $this, one blames personally [those who practice it]. 
Why is that? [One $thinks,] “Those renunciants and brahmins, through fear of dukkha, shave $off hair and beard, don yellow robes, and out of faith leave the household $life and become homeless to train in the path. 
Yet those renunciants and $brahmins embrace this dukkha, and therefore they are entirely beset by $suffering, vexation, trouble, and sadness; they are practicing wrongly.” $Having come to know this, one therefore blames them personally. 
$The presence of fetters that have not been eradicated is a state beset $by suffering, vexation, trouble, and sadness; it is wrong practice. 
Having $come to know this, one blames [such practitioners] personally. 
Why is $360^taisho702a Division 13$that? [One thinks,] “Those who have not eradicated the fetters, have not $eradicated becoming. 
Therefore they are entirely beset by suffering, vex￾ation, trouble, and sadness; they are practicing wrongly.” Having come $to know this, one therefore blames them personally. 
$The eradication of fetters is a state that is not beset by suffering, vex￾ation, trouble, and sadness; it is right practice. 
Having come to know this, $one praises [such practitioners] personally. 
Why is that? [One thinks,] $“Those who have eradicated the fetters, have eradicated becoming. 
There￾fore, they are entirely free from suffering, vexation, trouble, and sadness; $they are practicing rightly.” Having come to know this, one therefore $praises them personally. 
$Not seeking happiness within is a state beset by suffering, vexation, $trouble, and sadness; it is wrong practice.372 Having come to know this, $one blames [such practitioners] personally. 
Why is that? [One thinks,] $“Those who do not seek happiness within are not inner seekers. 
Therefore, $they are entirely beset by suffering, vexation, trouble, and sadness; they $are practicing wrongly.” Having come to know this, one therefore blames $them personally. 
$Seeking happiness within is a state not beset by suffering, vexation, trou￾ble, and sadness; it is right practice.

Why is that? [One thinks,] “Those who seek $happiness within are inner seekers.

$In these ways, there is praising, and there is blaming, but no teaching $of the Dharma. 
Neither praising them nor blaming them, one [should $instead] teach them the Dharma. 
How does one neither praise nor blame, $but [instead] teach the Dharma? $[Seeking] joy and happiness connected with sensual pleasure is an $extremely degrading activity engaged in by ordinary worldlings. 
It is a state $beset by suffering, vexation, trouble, and sadness; it is wrong practice.

“There is praising, there is blaming, and there is neither $praising nor blaming, which is teaching the Dharma”—this has been said $for this reason. 
$“Be committed to evenness and, having commitment and understanding, $constantly seek happiness within”—why has this been said? There is hap￾piness that is ignoble happiness, the happiness of the ordinary worldling, $which is basically a disease, basically a carbuncle, basically an arrow or $a thorn, which pertains to what is worldly (sāmisa), which pertains to birth $and death, which should not be cultivated, should not be practiced, should 702c not be made much of.

$“Be committed to evenness and, having commitment and understanding, $constantly seeks happiness within”—this has been said for this reason. 
$“Do not speak in an insinuating manner, and do not praise [someone] $to [their] face”373—why has this been said? There is insinuating speech $that is untrue, false, and not connected to what is beneficial; there is insin￾uating speech that is true, not false, but is not connected to what is ben￾eficial; and there is insinuating speech that is true, not false, and is con￾nected to what is beneficial. 
$Herein, if insinuating speech is untrue, false, and not connected to what $is beneficial, then it should not be spoken. 
Herein, if insinuating speech $is true, not false, but not connected to what is beneficial, then one should $also train in not speaking it. 
Herein, if insinuating speech is true, not false, $and is connected to what is beneficial, then if one knows the time is right, $364$Division 13$let it be accomplished with right comprehension and right mindfulness. 
$It is the same with praising [someone] to [their] face. 
“Do not speak in $an insinuating manner, and do not praise [someone] to [their] face”—this $has been said for this reason. 
$“Speak evenly and with restraint; do not speak unevenly and without $restraint”374—why has this been said? With uneven and unrestrained speech $the body becomes troubled, mindfulness is lost, the mind becomes very $fatigued, and the voice is spoiled and not easily understood. 
With speech $that is even and restrained the body does not become troubled, mindfulness $is not lost, the mind does not become very fatigued, the voice is not spoiled, $and it is easily understood. 
“Speak evenly and with restraint; do not speak 703a unevenly and without restraint”—this has been said for this reason. 
$“Follow local customs; do not insist on them and do not reject them”—$why has this been said? What is following local customs, [what is] insisting $on them, and [what is] rejecting them? $Various people in various regions in various ways may speak of a tray, $or they may speak of a dish, or they may speak of a platter, or they may $speak of a plate, or they may speak of a salver. 
As various people in various $regions in various ways may speak of a tray, or may speak of a dish, or $may speak of a platter, or may speak of a plate, or may speak of a salver, $each one is strong in always declaring: “This is true; anything else is $false.” In this way there is insisting on or rejecting of local customs. 
$What is neither insisting on nor rejecting of local customs? Various $people in various regions may, in various ways, speak of a tray, or speak $of a dish, or speak of a platter, or speak of a plate, or speak of a salver. 
$As various people in various regions may, in various ways, speak of a $tray, or speak of a dish, or speak of a platter, or speak of a plate, or speak $of a salver, each one is not strong in always declaring: “This is true; any￾thing else is false.” In this way there is neither insisting on nor rejecting $of local customs.

$There are states with conflict and there are states without conflict. 
What $are states with conflict and what are states without conflict?

$In this way the clansman Subhūti, by following the path of nonconflict, $subsequently came to understand the Dharma according to the Dharma. 
$Having known the Dharma as it really is Subhūti spoke this verse: $This practice is true emptiness; $Equanimity, this is dwelling in appeasement.375$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks $were delighted in it and received it respectfully. 
$170. 
^ck The Discourse to [a Brahmin $Named] Parrot376$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time, when the night was over, toward dawn, the World-honored $One put on his [outer] robe, took his bowl, and entered Sāvatthī to beg for $almsfood.377 While begging for almsfood, he approached the house of the $young brahmin [named] Parrot, the son of Todeyya. 
$At this time the young brahmin Parrot, Todeyya’s son, had gone out for $some small matter and was not at home. 
At that time in the house of the $young brahmin Parrot, Todeyya’s son, there was a white dog, which was on $a large bed eating from a golden feeding bowl. 
$Then the white dog saw the Buddha coming in the distance. 
Having seen $him, it barked. 
The World-honored One said to the white dog, “You should $not do that. 
You have gone from defaming [people in your previous existence] $to barking [at them in this existence].” $On hearing this, the white dog became extremely angry, got down from $the bed, went to a woodheap, and lay down beside it sad and distressed. 
$368^taisho704a Division 13$Later, on returning to the house, the young brahmin Parrot, Todeyya’s $son, saw that the white dog had become extremely angry and had gotten $down from the bed, had gone to the woodheap, and was lying beside it sad $and distressed. 
He asked the people in the house: $Who has harassed my dog, so that he has become extremely angry, has $gotten down from the bed, and has gone to the woodheap, and is lying $beside it sad and distressed? $The people of the house replied: $None of us has harassed the white dog, so that he has become very angry, $has gotten down from the bed, has gone to the woodheap, and is lying $beside it sad and distressed. 
Young brahmin, you should know that the $renunciant Gotama came here today to beg for almsfood. 
On seeing him, $the white dog chased him and barked at him. 
$The renunciant Gotama [then] said to the white dog, “You should not $do that. 
You have gone from defaming [people in your previous existence] $to barking [at them in this existence].” It is because of this, young brahmin, $for this reason that the white dog became extremely angry, got down from $the bed, went to the woodheap, and lay down beside it sad and distressed. 
$On hearing this the young brahmin Parrot, Todeyya’s son, became very angry, $wanting to defame the World-honored One, wanting to slander the World￾honored One, wanting to disparage the World-honored One. 
So, [in order] to $defame, slander, and disparage the renunciant Gotama, he right away went out $of Sāvatthī and approached Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the World-honored One was teaching the Dharma, surrounded $in front and behind by an immeasurably large assembly. 
Seeing the young $brahmin Parrot, Todeyya’s son, coming in the distance, the World-honored $One said to the monks, “Do you see the young brahmin Parrot, Todeyya’s $son, coming?” They answered, “We see him.” $The World-honored One said: $If the life of the young brahmin Parrot, Todeyya’s son, were to end now, $he would certainly be reborn in hell just as quickly as one might bend $one’s arm and stretch it out again. 
Why is that? Because he is extremely $angry with me. 
Because of [such] a mind full of anger, at the breaking up $369$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$of the body at death a living being will certainly go to a bad realm of exis￾tence and be reborn in hell. 
$Then the young brahmin Parrot, Todeyya’s son, approached the Buddha $and said to the World-honored One, “Renunciant Gotama, did you come to $my house today to beg for almsfood?” The World-honored One replied, “I $did go to your house today to beg for almsfood.” $[The young brahmin asked:] $Gotama, what did you say to my white dog, so that my white dog became $extremely angry, got down from the bed, went to the woodheap, and lay $down beside it sad and distressed? $The World-honored One replied: $Today, toward dawn, I put on my [outer] robe, took my bowl, and entered $Sāvatthī to beg for almsfood. 
Proceeding [from house to house] in turn, $I approached your house to beg for almsfood. 
Then the white dog saw $me coming in the distance. 
Having seen me, he barked. 
I said to the white $dog, “You should not do that. 
You have gone from defaming [people in $your previous existence] to barking [at them in this existence].” Because $of this, the white dog became extremely angry, got down from the bed, $went to the woodheap, and lay down beside it sad and distressed. 
$The young brahmin Parrot asked the World-honored One, “In its former $existence, what [relationship] did the white dog have to me?” $The World-honored One replied, “Stop, stop, young brahmin! Take care $not to ask me this; for on hearing [the answer], you will certainly be displeased.” $The young brahmin Parrot asked the World-honored One three times, “In $its former existence, what [relationship] did the white dog have to me?” The $World-honored One replied three times: “Stop, stop, young brahmin! Take $care not to ask me this; for on hearing [the answer], you will certainly be $displeased.” $The World-honored One said to the young brahmin, “You asked me three $times and would not stop. 
Young brahmin, you should know that in its former $existence the white dog was your father, Todeyya.” $On hearing this, the young brahmin Parrot became even more angry, wanting $to defame the World-honored One, wanting to slander the World-honored One, $370^taisho704b Division 13$wanting to disparage the World-honored One. 
Thus [in order] to defame, slander, $and disparage the renunciant Gotama, he said to the World-honored One: $My father Todeyya was a great donor; he performed great sacrifices. 
With $the breaking up of the body at death he [should] rightly have been reborn $in the Brahmā world. 
Through what cause, what condition, would he have $been reborn in this lowly condition among dogs? $The World-honored One said: $Your father Todeyya was very conceited. 
This is the reason why he was $reborn in a lowly condition among dogs. 
$A brahmin who is very conceited $After death will be reborn in [one of] six types of existence: $As a chicken, a dog, a pig, or a jackal, $A donkey as the fifth, or in hell as the sixth. 
$Young brahmin Parrot, if you do not believe what I have said, return $[home] and say to the white dog, “If in your former existence you were $my father, white dog, then you should get back on the big bed.” Young $brahmin, the white dog will certainly get back on the bed. 
$[Then say,] “White dog, if in your former existence you were my father, $then go back to eating from the golden feeding bowl.” Young brahmin, the $white dog will certainly go back to eating from the golden feeding bowl. 
$[Then say this,] “If in your former existence you were my father, show me $the place, unknown to me, where you hid gold, silver, crystal, and jewelry.” $Young brahmin, the white dog will certainly show you a place, unknown $to you, where gold, silver, crystal, and jewelry are hidden. 
$Then, on hearing what the Buddha said, the young brahmin Parrot mem￾orized it well and recited it. 
Having circumambulated the World-honored $One, he returned to his home. 
He said to the white dog, “If in your former $existence you were my father, white dog, then you should get back on the $big bed.” And the white dog promptly got back on the big bed. 
$[Then he said,] “White dog, if in your former existence you were my father, $then you should go back to eating from the golden feeding bowl.” And the $white dog promptly went back to eating from the golden feeding bowl. 
$371$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$[Again, he said,] “If in your former existence you were my father, show $me the place, unknown to me, where my father earlier hid gold, silver, crystal, $and jewelry.” The white dog promptly got down from the bed and went to $the place where, in his previous existence, he used to spend the night. 
With $its muzzle and paws it began digging beneath the four feet of the bed. 
From $that place, the young brahmin Parrot recovered a great treasure. 
$Thereupon, having recovered the treasure, the young brahmin Parrot, $Todeyya’s son, was extremely happy. 
He knelt with his right knee on the $ground, extended his hands with joined palms in the direction of Jeta’s Grove, $Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park, and three times expressed praise for the World-honored $One aloud: “What the renunciant Gotama said was not false! What the renun￾ciant Gotama said was true! What the renunciant Gotama said was according $to reality!” Having praised [the Buddha] three times, he went out of Sāvatthī$and approached Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the World-honored One was teaching the Dharma surrounded $in front and behind by an immeasurably large assembly. 
Seeing the young $brahmin Parrot coming in the distance, the World-honored One said to the $monks, “Do you see the young brahmin Parrot coming?” They answered, $“We see him.” $The World-honored One said: $If the life of the young brahmin Parrot were to end now, he would certainly $go to a good realm of existence, just as quickly as one might bend one’s $arm and stretch it out again. 
Why is that? Because he has an extremely $wholesome mental attitude toward me. 
Because of [such] a wholesome $state of mind, at the breaking up of the body at death living beings will $certainly go to a good realm of existence, being reborn in heaven. 
$At that time the young brahmin Parrot approached the Buddha, exchanged $friendly greetings, stepped back, and sat to one side. 
The World-honored $One said, “How was it, young brahmin? Was it as I said regarding the white $dog, or was it not so?” $The young brahmin Parrot replied, “Gotama, it really was as you said. 
$Gotama, I wish to ask something else. 
Will you listen if I venture to express $it?” The World-honored One said, “Ask as you wish.” $372^taisho704c Division 13$Gotama, what is the cause, what is the condition why living beings that $have received a human body are superior or inferior, excellent or not $excellent? Why is that? $Gotama, I see those who have a short life span and those who have a $long life span. 
I see those who are often unwell and those who are seldom $unwell. 
I see those who are ugly and those who are handsome. 
I see those $who lack power and those who have power. 
I see those who are from $lowly families and those who are from respected families. 
I see those who $lack wealth and those who have wealth. 
I see those who have bad knowl￾edge and those who have good knowledge. 
$The World-honored One replied: $Those living beings are [like this] because of the deeds that they themselves $have done. 
The results obtained are caused by these deeds. 
Conditioned $by [their own] deeds, dependent on [their own] deeds, having [their own] $deeds as their abode, living beings are correspondingly superior or inferior, $excellent or not excellent. 
$The young brahmin Parrot said to the World-honored One: $What the renunciant Gotama has said in brief, without analyzing it at $length, I am unable to understand. 
May the renunciant Gotama explain it $to me at length so that I get to understand the meaning. 
$The World-honored One said, “Young brahmin, listen closely and pay $proper attention. 
I will analyze it in detail for you.” $The young brahmin Parrot said, “Yes, indeed. 
I shall listen and receive $the teaching.” $The Buddha said: $Young brahmin, what is the cause, what is the condition for a man or a $woman to be of extremely short life span? $Suppose that a man or a woman kills living beings, is wicked, bad, $very evil, bloodthirsty, of harmful intent, attached to evil, devoid of mental $states of kindness for living beings, even including insects.378 One who $has undertaken and performed such deeds will, on the breaking up of the $373^taisho705a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$body at death, certainly [either] go to a bad realm of existence, being $reborn in hell, [or else] on being reborn among human beings, he or she $will be of short life span.379$Why is that?

^ck The Discourse on a Great $Analysis of Karma382$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Rājagaha, staying $in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. 
$At that time the venerable Samiddhi was also dwelling at Rājagaha, staying $in a meditation hut in the forest. 
Then the heterodox practitioner Potaliputta, $while roaming around in the afternoon, approached the venerable Samiddhi. 
$Having exchanged friendly greetings, he stepped back, sat to one side, [and $said,] “Venerable friend Samiddhi, I would like to ask a question. 
Do you $permit me to ask it?” $The venerable Samiddhi replied, “Venerable friend Potaliputta, ask what $you wish to ask. 
Having heard it, I will consider it.” $The heterodox practitioner Potaliputta asked: $Venerable friend Samiddhi, I have heard face to face from the renunciant $Gotama, received it face to face from the renunciant Gotama, that bodily $and verbal actions are vain and false, and only mental action is real and $380$Division 13$true; and that there is a state of concentration such that, when a monk $enters this state of concentration, nothing is felt. 
$The venerable Samiddhi replied: $Venerable friend Potaliputta, do not speak like this! Do not misrepresent $the World-honored One! It is not good to misrepresent the World-honored $One. 
The World-honored One does not speak like this, venerable friend $Potaliputta. 
$The World-honored One has with countless skillful means explained: $“If one intentionally performs an action which, having been performed, $comes to fruition, then, I say, it is not the case that one does not experience $its result. 
Either one experiences it in this life or one experiences it in a $later life. 
If one unintentionally performs an action which, having been $performed, comes to fruition, then I do not say that one must experience $its result.”383$Three times the heterodox practitioner Potaliputta said to the venerable $Samiddhi: $Venerable friend Samiddhi, I have heard face to face from the renunciant $Gotama, received it face to face from the renunciant Gotama, that bodily 706c and verbal actions are vain and false, and only mental action is real and $true; and that there is a state of concentration such that, when a monk $enters this state of concentration, nothing is felt. 
$And three times the venerable Samiddhi replied: $Venerable friend Potaliputta, do not speak like this! Do not misrepresent $the World-honored One! It is not good to misrepresent the World-honored $One. 
The World-honored One does not speak like this, venerable friend $Potaliputta. 
$The World-honored One has with countless skillful means explained: “If $one intentionally performs an action which, having been performed, comes $to fruition, then, I say, it is not the case that one does not experience its result; $either one experiences it in this life or one experiences it in a later life. 
If one $unintentionally performs an action which, having been performed, comes $to fruition, then I do not say that one must experience its result. 
$381$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$The heterodox practitioner Potaliputta asked the venerable Samiddhi, “If $one intentionally performs an action which, having been performed, comes $to fruition, what result will one experience?”384$The venerable Samiddhi replied, “Venerable friend Potaliputta, if one $intentionally performs an action which, having been performed, comes to $fruition, one will certainly experience dukkha.”$The heterodox practitioner Potaliputta asked the venerable Samiddhi, $“Venerable friend Samiddhi, how long have you been training on the path $of this Dharma and discipline?” $The venerable Samiddhi replied, “Venerable friend Potaliputta, I have not $been training on the path of this Dharma and discipline for long; [just] three $years.” $Then the heterodox practitioner Potaliputta thought, “If even such a junior $monk is capable of defending his teacher, how much more so would senior $elders who are veterans in the training!” Then the heterodox practitioner $Potaliputta, having heard what the venerable Samiddhi said, neither agreed $nor disagreed with it, but rose from his seat and left, shaking his head. 
$At that time the venerable Mahācunda was seated for the day’s abiding $in a place not far from the venerable Samiddhi. 
Then the venerable Mahā-$cunda, who had memorized and borne well in mind the whole conversation $that had taken place between the venerable Samiddhi and the heterodox prac￾titioner Potaliputta, rose from his seat and approached the venerable Ānanda. 
$Having exchanged friendly greetings, he stepped back, sat to one side, and $reported to the venerable Ānanda the whole conversation that had taken place $between the venerable Samiddhi and the heterodox practitioner Potaliputta.385$Having heard it, the venerable Ānanda said: $Venerable friend Cunda, in relation to this conversation, let us go and visit $the Buddha and present it to the World-honored One. 
Venerable friend $Cunda, let us now together approach the Buddha and tell the World-hon￾ored One all about this matter. 
Perhaps we will thereby get to hear from $the World-honored One a teaching that differs [from Samiddhi’s reply].” $Then the venerable Ānanda and the venerable Mahācunda went together to $the Buddha. 
The venerable Mahācunda paid homage with his head at the $382$Division 13$Buddha’s feet, stepped back, and sat to one side; the venerable Ānanda paid $homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet, stepped back, and stood to one side. 
$Then the venerable Ānanda said, “Venerable friend Mahācunda, please 707a speak, please speak!” $Then the World-honored One asked, “Ānanda, what matter does the monk $Cunda wish to speak about?” $The venerable Ānanda said, “The World-honored One will now hear it $from him directly.” $Then the venerable Mahācunda reported to the Buddha the whole conver￾sation that had taken place between the venerable Samiddhi and the heterodox $practitioner Potaliputta. 
Having heard it, the World-honored One said: $See, Ānanda. 
The monk Samiddhi, this foolish man, is on the wrong track. 
$Why is that? The heterodox practitioner Potaliputta asked about a matter $that is not definite, but the monk Samiddhi, this foolish man, gave a definite $answer.386$The venerable Ānanda said, “World-honored One, if the monk Samiddhi $was speaking in relation to the dictum that whatever is felt is dukkha, then $what is his fault?”387$The World-honored One reproved the venerable Ānanda: $See, the monk Ānanda is also on the wrong track. 
Ānanda, this foolish $man Samiddhi was asked by the heterodox practitioner Potaliputta about $all three feelings: pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neutral feeling. 
$Ānanda, this foolish man Samiddhi [should have] answered the question $by the heterodox practitioner Potaliputta like this: “Venerable friend Potal￾iputta, if one intentionally performs a pleasant action which, having been $performed, comes to fruition, then one will experience a pleasant result. 
$If one intentionally performs a painful action which, having been per￾formed, comes to fruition, then one will experience a painful result. 
If $one intentionally performs a neutral action which, having been performed, $comes to fruition, then one will experience a neutral result.” $Ānanda, if this foolish man Samiddhi had answered the question by $the heterodox practitioner Potaliputta like this, then the heterodox prac￾titioner Potaliputta would not even have dared to look this foolish man $383$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Samiddhi in the eye, let alone ask him such a question. 
Ānanda, if you $were to hear from the World-honored One the “Discourse on a Great $Analysis of Karma,” then you would develop greater and superior mental $tranquility and happiness with regard to the Tathāgata. 
$Then the venerable Ānanda, extending his hands with joined palms toward $the Buddha, said: $World-honored One, now is the right time; Well-gone One, now is the $right time for the World-honored One to deliver the “Discourse on a Great $Analysis of Karma.” Having heard it, the monks will remember it well. 
$The World-honored One said, “Ānanda, listen closely and pay proper $attention. 
I will analyze it in detail for you.” $The venerable Ānanda said, “Yes, certainly.” $Then the monks listened to receive the teaching. 
The Buddha said: $Ānanda, suppose that someone does not refrain from killing, from stealing, $from sexual misconduct, from false speech ...
up to ...
wrong view; not $having refrained, not having exercised restraint, on the breaking up of the $body at death he is reborn in a good realm of existence, in heaven.

$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the venerable $Ānanda and the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.$392$Division 14$On the Mind$172. 
^ck The Discourse on the Mind391$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s 709a$Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time there was a monk who, while sitting in meditation in peaceful $seclusion, had this thought in his mind: “By what are [people of] the world $led? By what are they defiled and attached? By the arising of what are they $controlled?”392 Then, in the afternoon, the monk rose from his seated medi￾tation and approached the Buddha. 
Having paid homage with his head at [the $Buddha’s] feet, he stepped back and sat to one side. 
He said: $World-honored One, just now, while sitting in meditation in peaceful $seclusion, I had this thought in my mind, “By what are [people of] the $world led? By what are they defiled and attached? By the arising of what $are they controlled?” $On hearing this, the World-honored One praised him, saying: $It is well, monk, it is well, namely that, having a skillful approach, skillful $contemplation, and superb eloquence, you have the proper reflection: “By $what are [people of] the world led? By what are they defiled and attached? $By the arising of what are they controlled?” Monk, is this what you are $asking? $The monk replied, “That is so, World-honored One.” $The World-honored One said: $Monk, by the mind [people of] the world are led, by the mind they are $defiled and attached, by the arising of the mind they are controlled. 
By $that [people of] the world are led, by that they are defiled and attached, $by the arising of that they are controlled. 
$393$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Monk, the learned noble disciple is not led by the mind, he is not defiled $and attached by the mind, he is not controlled by the mind. 
Monk, the $learned noble disciple does not follow the mind’s control; rather, the mind $follows the learned noble disciple.393$The monk said, “It is well, World-honored One, it is well indeed!” Then, $having heard what the Buddha said, the monk was delighted and received it $respectfully. 
He asked: $World-honored One, “a learned monk”; one speaks of “a learned monk.” $World-honored One, what makes a monk learned? How does one designate $a monk as “learned”? $On hearing this, the World-honored One praised him, saying: $It is well, monk, it is well, namely that, having a skillful approach, skillful $contemplation, and superb eloquence, you have the proper reflection: $“World-honored One, ‘a learned monk’; one speaks of ‘a learned monk.’ $World-honored One, what makes a monk learned? Whom does one des￾ignate as ‘a learned monk’?” Monk, is this what you are asking? $The monk replied, “That is so, World-honored One.” $The World-honored One said: $Monk, I have taught a great many things, namely: discourses (sutta), stan￾zas (geyya), expositions (veyyākaraṇa), verses (gāthā), causes (nidāna), $inspired utterances (udāna), heroic tales (apadāna), [what has been] “thus $said” (itivuttaka), birth stories (jātaka), answers to questions (vedalla), $marvels (abbhutadhamma), and explanations of meaning (upadesa).394$Monk, if a son of good family, on being taught by me [just] a four-line $verse, comes to know its meaning, comes to know the Dharma, progresses $in the Dharma, moves toward the Dharma, progresses in the holy life, $then, monk, what one speaks of as “a learned monk” is nothing more than $this. 
Monk, such is a learned monk. 
Such a one the Tathāgata designates $as a learned monk. 
$The monk said, “It is well, World-honored One, it is well indeed!” Then, $having heard what the Buddha said, the monk was delighted and received it $respectfully. 
He asked: $394^taisho709b Division 14$World-honored One, “a learned monk with penetrative wisdom”; one $speaks of “a learned monk with penetrative wisdom.” World-honored $One, what makes a monk learned with penetrative wisdom? Whom does $one designate as “a learned monk with penetrative wisdom”? $On hearing this, the World-honored One praised him, saying: $It is well, monk, it is well, namely that, having a skillful approach, skillful $contemplation, and superb eloquence, you have the proper reflection: $“World-honored One, ‘a learned monk with penetrative wisdom’; one $speaks of ‘a learned monk with penetrative wisdom.’ World-honored One, $what makes a monk learned with penetrative wisdom? Whom does one $designate as ‘a learned monk with penetrative wisdom’?” Monk, is this $what you are asking? $The monk replied, “That is so, World-honored One.” $The World-honored One said: $Monk, if a monk hears: “This is dukkha,” and with wisdom rightly sees $dukkha as it really is; if he hears of the arising of dukkha ...
of the cessation $of dukkha ...
of the path to the cessation of dukkha, and with wisdom $rightly sees the path to the cessation of dukkha as it really is, then, monk, $such is “a learned monk with penetrative wisdom.” This is what the Tathā-$gata designates as “a learned monk with penetrative wisdom.” $The monk said, “It is well, World-honored One, it is well indeed!” Then, $having heard what the Buddha said, the monk was delighted and received it $respectfully. 
He asked: $World-honored One, “an intelligent monk, clever, and with vast wisdom”; $one speaks of “an intelligent monk, clever, and with vast wisdom.” World￾honored One, what makes a monk intelligent, clever, and with vast wis￾dom? Whom does one designate as “an intelligent monk, clever, and with $vast wisdom”? $On hearing this, the World-honored One praised him, saying: $It is well, monk, it is well, namely that, having a skillful approach, skillful $contemplation, and superb eloquence, you have the proper reflection: $[“World-honored One, ‘an intelligent monk, clever, and with vast wisdom’; $395^taisho709c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$one speaks of ‘an intelligent monk, clever, and with vast wisdom.’] World￾honored One, what makes a monk intelligent, clever, and with vast wis￾dom? Whom does one designate as ‘an intelligent monk, clever, and with $vast wisdom’?” Monk, is this what you are asking? $The monk replied, “That is so, World-honored One.” $The World-honored One said: $If a monk does not think of harming himself, does not think of harming $others, does not think of harming both; [if] instead a monk thinks of ben￾efiting himself and others, benefiting many, with empathy for the world, $seeking what is meaningful and of benefit for devas and human beings, $seeking their ease and happiness; then monk, such is “an intelligent monk, $clever, and with vast wisdom.” Such a one the Tathāgata designates as an $intelligent monk, clever, and with vast wisdom.395$The monk said, “It is well, World-honored One, it is well indeed!” $Then the monk, having heard what the Buddha said, received it well, $retained it well, and recited it well. 
He rose from his seat, paid homage with $his head at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and returned. 
$Then the monk, having heard the World-honored One’s teaching, went $and dwelled alone in a secluded place and practiced diligently, with his mind $free of negligence.

He dwelled having personally attained understanding, awakening, $and realization here and now. 
He knew as it really is: “Birth has been ended, $the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, there $will not be another experiencing of existence.” That venerable one, having $come to know the Dharma ...

^ck The Discourse to Bhūmija396$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha, in the $Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. 
$396$Division 14$At that time the venerable Bhūmija was also staying at Rājagaha, in a $secluded meditation hut. 
Then, when the night was over, at dawn, the venerable 710a$Bhūmija put on his robes and took his almsbowl, intending to go into Rājagaha $to beg for almsfood. 
Then the venerable Bhūmija had this thought: “For the $time being, never mind about going into Rājagaha to beg for food. 
Let me $rather approach the house of Prince Jayasena.” Then the venerable Bhūmija $approached the house of Prince Jayasena. 
$On seeing the venerable Bhūmija coming in the distance, Prince Jayasena $rose from his seat, arranged his clothes so as to bare one shoulder, extended $his hands with joined palms toward the venerable Bhūmija, and said, “Wel￾come, venerable Bhūmija. 
It is a long time since the venerable Bhūmija came $here. 
Please be seated on this seat.” Then the venerable Bhūmija sat down. 
$Prince Jayasena paid homage with his head at the venerable Bhūmija’s $feet, stepped back, and sat to one side. 
He said, “Venerable Bhūmija, I would $like to ask a question. 
Do you permit me to ask it?” $The venerable Bhūmija replied, “Prince, ask whatever you wish. 
Having $heard [your question], I will consider it.” $The prince asked the venerable Bhūmija: $Sometimes there are renunciants and brahmins who come and call on $me. 
They tell me: “Prince, if one makes an aspiration and <practices> $the holy life, then one will certainly get results; or if one does not make $an aspiration ...
or if one both makes an aspiration and does not make $an aspiration ...
or if one neither makes an aspiration nor does not make $an aspiration and practices the holy life, then one will certainly get $results.”397 $Venerable Bhūmija, what is the position of your venerable teacher? $What does he say [regarding this]?398$The venerable Bhūmija said: $Prince, I have not myself heard [anything regarding this] from the World￾honored One or from my companions in the holy life. 
However, prince, $the World-honored One might speak in this manner: “If one makes an $aspiration and properly practices the holy life, then one will certainly get $results; or if one does not make an aspiration ...
or if one both makes an $aspiration and does not make an aspiration ...
or if one neither makes an $397$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$aspiration nor does not make an aspiration and properly practices the holy $life, then one will certainly get results.” $The prince said: $If the position of the venerable teacher of the venerable Bhūmija is like $this and he speaks like this, then in this world with its devas and māras, $Brahmās, renunciants and brahmins, from human beings to devas, he is $foremost and supreme. 
Venerable Bhūmija, please take your meal here.399$The venerable Bhūmija accepted by remaining silent. 
Knowing that the $venerable Bhūmija had accepted by remaining silent, the prince rose from $his seat and personally brought water for washing [the hands], and personally $offered various kinds of fine dishes, delicious, plentiful, and easy to digest, $making sure there was enough. 
After the meal, he gathered up the utensils, $again brought water for washing, and then seated himself on a small seat to $one side to listen to the Dharma. 
$The venerable Bhūmija expounded the Dharma to him, exhorting and $inspiring him, fully delighting him, teaching him the Dharma with countless $skillful means. 
Having exhorted and inspired him, having fully delighted $him, [the venerable Bhūmija] rose from his seat and left. 
He approached the $Buddha.

^ck The Discourse on Ways $of Practice (1)402$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $In the world there are actually four ways of practice. 
What are the four? $There is a way of practice that is pleasant now but results in future pain; $there is a way of practice that is painful now but results in future pleasure; $there is a way of practice that is painful now and results in future pain; $and there is a way of practice that is pleasant now and results in future $pleasure.403$What is the way of practice that is pleasant now but results in future $pain? There are some renunciants and brahmins who amuse themselves $with prettily adorned girls, saying, “What is the future dread that these $[other] renunciants and brahmins see in sensual desires? What is the disaster $[on account of which] they cut off sensual desires and advocate the cutting $off of sensual desires? The bodies of these prettily adorned girls are pleas￾urable, pleasant to touch!” They amuse themselves with these girls, $indulging themselves with them. 
While engaging in this practice, they are $404$Division 14$fully satisfied with it. 
[But] with the breaking up of the body at death they $go to a bad realm, being reborn in hell. 
$[Only] then do they think, “This is the future dread that those [other] $renunciants and brahmins saw in sensual desires. 
This is the disaster on $account of which they cut off sensual desires and advocated the cutting $off of sensual desires. 
It is because of sensual desires, through being $subject to sensual desires, on account of sensual desires, that we are now $experiencing such extreme suffering, such severe suffering.” $It is just as when, in the last month of the hot season, in the extreme $daytime heat, a pod of the māluva creeper splits open and a seed from it $falls at the foot of a sāla tree. 
Then, because of that, dread arises in the $tree spirit in that sāla tree. 
At this the relatives and friends of that tree $spirit—village spirits in the vicinity of that seed [such as] the tree spirits $of the numerous village cereal crops and medicinal plants—see future $dread and disaster in that seed, and they therefore approach that tree spirit $and console it, saying, “Tree spirit, do not be afraid! Tree spirit, do not $be afraid! This seed will be eaten by a deer, or it will be eaten by a peacock, $or it will be blown away by the wind, or it will be burned in a village fire, $or it will be burned in a grass fire, or it will rot and become unable to $sprout. 
In these ways, tree spirit, you will be safe.” [But] suppose that this $seed is not eaten by a deer, not eaten by a peacock, not blown away by $the wind, not burned in a village fire, not burned in a grass fire, and does $not rot and become unable to sprout; this seed is not deficient, not punc￾tured, and not cracked; it is not damaged by wind, rain, or sun. 
It is sprin￾kled with abundant rain and quickly grows. 
$Then that tree spirit thinks, “How is this? What is the future dread that $my relatives and friends—village spirits in the vicinity of that seed [such $as] the tree spirits of the numerous village cereal crops and medicinal $plants—saw in that seed? What is the disaster on account of which they $came and consoled me, saying, ‘Tree spirit, do not be afraid! Tree spirit, $do not be afraid! This seed will be eaten by a deer, or it will be eaten by $a peacock, or it will be blown away by the wind, or it will be burned in $a village fire, or it will be burned in a grass fire, or it will rot and become $unable to sprout. 
In these ways, tree spirit, you will be safe.’ $405^taisho711c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$“For this seed was not eaten by a deer, not eaten by a peacock, not $blown away by the wind, not burned in a village fire, not burned in a grass $fire, and did not rot and become unable to sprout; this seed was not defi-$cient, not punctured, and not cracked; it was not damaged by wind, rain, $or sun. 
It was sprinkled by abundant rain and has quickly grown. 
$“It has developed stems, branches, and leaves, tender and soft. 
It has $developed joints and become very pleasant to the touch!” $Those stems, branches, and leaves, tender and soft, and those joints that $have become very pleasant to the touch become ever more pleasant to the $touch. 
Because of the tree they develop into great branches, joints, and $leaves, which surround that tree and cover it up to the top. 
[Only] when it $has become covered up right to the top does the tree spirit think, “This is $the future dread that my relatives and friends—village spirits in the vicinity $of that seed [such as] the tree spirits of the numerous village cereal crops $and medicinal plants—saw in that seed. 
This is the disaster on account of $which they came and consoled me, saying, ‘Tree spirit, do not be afraid! $Tree spirit, do not be afraid! This seed will be eaten by a deer, or it will be $eaten by a peacock, or it will be blown away by the wind, or it will be burned $in a village fire, or it will be burned in a grass fire, or it will rot and become $unable to sprout. 
In these ways, tree spirit, you will be safe.’ $“Yet, this seed was not eaten by a deer, not eaten by a peacock, not $blown away by the wind, not burned in a village fire, not burned in a grass $fire, and did not rot and become unable to sprout; this seed was not defi-$cient, not punctured, and not cracked; it was not damaged by wind, rain, $or sun. 
It was sprinkled by abundant rain and quickly grew. 
It is because $of that seed, on account of that seed, that I am now experiencing such $extreme suffering, such severe suffering.” $In the same way, there are some renunciants and brahmins who amuse $themselves with prettily adorned girls, saying, “What is the future dread $that these [other] renunciants and brahmins see in sensual desires? What $is the disaster [on account of which] they cut off sensual desires and advo￾cate the cutting off of sensual desires? The bodies of these prettily adorned $girls are pleasurable, pleasant to the touch.” They amuse themselves with $these girls, indulging themselves with it. 
While engaging in this practice, $406^taisho712a Division 14$they are fully satisfied with it. 
[But] with the breaking up of the body at $death they go to a bad realm, being reborn in hell. 
$Only then do they think, “This is the future dread that those renunciants $and brahmins saw in sensual desires; this is the disaster on account of $which they cut off sensual desires and advocated the cutting off of sensual $desires. 
It is because of sensual desires, through being subject to sensual $desires, on account of sensual desires, that we are now experiencing such $extreme suffering, such severe suffering.” This is the way of practice that $is pleasant now but results in future pain. 
$What is the way of practice that is painful now but results in future $pleasure? Suppose that someone is by nature strongly polluted by sensual $desire, strongly polluted by anger, strongly polluted by delusion. 
Being $frequently under the influence of sensual desire, his mind experiences pain, $grief, and sorrow. 
Being frequently under the influence of anger ...
of $delusion, his mind experiences pain, grief, and sorrow. 
Pained and $aggrieved, he lives the holy life for his whole life ...
up to ...
crying and $in tears. 
While engaging in this practice, he is fully satisfied with it; and $with the breaking up of the body at death he certainly ascends to a good $realm, being reborn in heaven. 
This is the way of practice that is painful $now but results in future pleasure. 
$What is the way of practice that is painful now and results in future $pain? There are some renunciants and brahmins who go naked, unclothed, $who use their hands as clothes [to cover their private parts], or use leaves $as clothes, or use beads as clothes; who will not use a pot to get water, or $will not use a ladle to get water; who will not eat food [obtained by others] $by robbery with blade and cudgel; who will not eat food obtained by $deception, or by personally approaching [a donor], or by sending a mes￾senger [to get it], or [when called thus]: “Come, venerable sir!” or “Wel￾come, venerable sir!” or “Stay, venerable sir!” $Or who, when two are eating together, will not eat with them; or who $will not eat food from a house where there is a pregnant woman, or from $a house where there is a pet dog; or who will not eat food from a house $where there are flies that have been around excrement; or who do not eat $fish, do not eat meat, do not drink liquor, do not drink water [considered $407^taisho712b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$as] evil, or do not drink at all but train in the practice of not drinking; or $who eat one mouthful and are content with one mouthful, or eat two $mouthfuls, or three, four ...
or at most seven mouthfuls and are content $with seven mouthfuls. 
$Or who eat [only the almsfood] they obtain at a single [house] and are $content with what they obtain at a single [house], or at two [houses], or $three, four ...
or at most seven [houses] and are content with what they $obtain at seven [houses]; or who have one meal a day and are content $with one meal, or one meal in two days, or in three, four, five, six, or seven $days, or in a fortnight, or who have one meal in a month and are content $with one meal [in a month]. 
$Or who eat edible roots, or wild rice, or millet, or rice bran, or rice $scum, or coarse food; who go to the forest and live off [what they find] $in the forest, or eat roots or eat fruit, or eat fallen fruit. 
$Or who clothe themselves in patchwork robes, or in robes made of $hair, or in robes made of coarse fabric, or in robes made of hair and coarse $fabric; or who wear complete hides, or wear pierced hides, or wear com￾plete pierced hides; who keep their hair disheveled, or keep their hair in $braids, or keep their hair disheveled and in braids, or shave off their hair, $or shave off their beard, or shave off their hair and beard,404 or tear out $their hair, or tear out their beard, or tear out their hair and beard. 
$Or who stand continuously, abstaining from sitting; or move about in a $squatting position; or lie down on thorns, using a bed of thorns; or lie down $on fruits, using a bed of fruit; or who worship water day and night, pouring $it out with their hands; or who worship fire, keeping it burning continuously. 
$Or who worship the sun and moon, revering them as spirits of great might, $and extending their hands with joined palms toward them. 
$In these ways they experience immeasurable suffering, practicing self￾mortification. 
While engaging in this practice, they are fully satisfied with $it; and with the breaking up of the body at death they certainly go to a $bad realm, being reborn in hell. 
This is the way of practice that is painful $now and results in future pain. 
$What is the way of practice that is pleasant now and results in future $pleasure? Suppose someone is by nature not strongly polluted by sensual $desire, not strongly polluted by anger, not strongly polluted by delusion. 
$408$Division 14$Not being frequently under the influence of sensual desire, his mind does not $experience pain, grief, and sorrow. 
Not being frequently under the influence $of anger ...

While engaging in this practice, he is fully satisfied with $it; and, having eradicated the five lower fetters, he will be spontaneously $born <in between> and attain final nirvana there.405 Having attained the $condition of nonreturning, he will not come back to this world.406 This is $the way of practice that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure. 
$It was in relation to this that I said, “In the world there are actually $these four ways of practice.” $Thus spoke the Buddha.

At one time the Buddha was staying among the Kurus, $at a Kuru town called Kammāsadhamma. 
$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $People in this world have a desire like this, a hope like this, a craving like $this, a source of happiness like this, an expectation like this: “May states $that are not enjoyable, not desirable, and not agreeable cease! May states $that are enjoyable, desirable, and agreeable arise!” They have a desire $like this, a hope like this, a craving like this, a source of happiness like $this, an expectation like this. 
Yet, states that are not enjoyable, not desirable, $and not agreeable arise, and states that are enjoyable, desirable, and agree￾able cease. 
This is a state of delusion. 
$My teaching is profound, difficult to see, difficult to awaken to, difficult $to penetrate. 
In my teaching, which is profound, difficult to see, difficult $to awaken to, difficult to penetrate, states that are not enjoyable, not desir￾able, and not agreeable do cease, and states that are enjoyable, desirable, $and agreeable do arise. 
This is a state of nondelusion.408$In the world there are actually four ways of practice. 
What are the four? $There is a way of practice that is pleasant now but results in future pain; there $409^taisho712c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$is a way of practice that is painful now but results in future pleasure; there is $a way of practice that is painful now and results in future pain; and there is a $way of practice that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure.409$What is the way of practice that is pleasant now but results in future pain? $Suppose there is someone who is himself happy and joyful when he kills $living beings, for whom killing living beings gives rise to happiness and joy.

$It was because of this that I said, “In the world there are actually these $four ways of practice.” $Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks $were delighted and received it respectfully. 
$414^taisho713c Division 14$176. 
^ck The Discourse on Practitioners $of the Absorptions $Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $In the world there are actually four types of practitioners of the absorptions. 
$What are the four? $There is the practitioner of the absorptions who is progressing but $thinks he is regressing; there is the practitioner of the absorptions who is $regressing but thinks he is progressing; there is the practitioner of the $absorptions who is regressing and knows, as it really is, that he is regress￾ing; and there is the practitioner of the absorptions who is progressing $and knows, as it really is, that he is progressing. 
$How does a practitioner of the absorptions who is progressing think $that he is regressing? The practitioner of the absorptions, secluded from $sensual desires, secluded from evil and unwholesome states, with [directed] $awareness and [sustained] contemplation, with rapture and happiness born $of seclusion, dwells having attained the first absorption. 
$Cultivating right attention, his mind moves on from the first absorption $to the second absorption, which is superior in calm and quietude. 
That 714a practitioner of the absorptions then thinks, “My mind has separated from $the earlier characteristics and has moved to another sphere [of experience]. 
$It has lost the first absorption; [that level of] concentration has ceased.” $That practitioner of the absorptions does not know as it really is, that: $“By cultivating right attention my mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, has moved $on from the first absorption to the second absorption, which is superior $in calm and quietude.” $Not knowing this as it really is, he [feels] as if he had regressed and $his mind had lost [that level of] concentration. 
This is how a practitioner $of the absorptions progresses but thinks he is regressing. 
$Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, with the calming of [directed] $awareness and [sustained] contemplation, with inner stillness and mental $unification, without [directed] awareness and [sustained] contemplation, $415$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$with rapture and happiness born of concentration, dwells having attained $the second absorption. 
$Cultivating right attention, his mind moves on from the second absorp￾tion to the third absorption, which is superior in calm and quietude. 
That $practitioner of the absorptions then thinks, “My mind has separated from $the earlier characteristics and has moved to another sphere [of experience]. 
$It has lost the second absorption; [that level of] concentration has ceased.” $That practitioner of the absorptions does not know as it really is, that: $“By cultivating right attention my mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, has pro￾gressed from the second absorption to the third absorption, which is supe￾rior in calm and quietude.” $Not knowing this as it really is, he [feels] as if he had regressed and $his mind had lost [that level of] concentration. 
This is how a practitioner $of the absorptions progresses but thinks he is regressing. 
$Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, secluded from rapture and $pleasure, dwelling in equanimity and without seeking anything, with right $mindfulness and right comprehension, experiencing happiness with the $body, dwells having attained the third absorption, which the noble ones $speak of as noble equanimity and mindfulness, a happy abode. 
$Cultivating right attention, his mind moves on from the third absorption $to the fourth absorption, which is superior in calm and quietude. 
That $practitioner of the absorptions then thinks, “My mind has separated from $the earlier characteristics and has moved to another sphere [of experience]. 
$It has lost the third absorption; [that level of] concentration has ceased.” $That practitioner of the absorptions does not know as it really is, that: $“By cultivating right attention my mind, joyful, calm, and quiet, has moved $on from the third absorption to the fourth absorption, which is superior $in calm and quietude.” $Not knowing this as it really is, he [feels] as if he had regressed and $his mind had lost [that level of] concentration. 
This is how a practitioner $of the absorptions progresses but thinks he is regressing. 
$Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, with the cessation of pleasure $and the cessation of pain, and with the earlier cessation of rapture and $displeasure, with neither-pain-nor-pleasure, with purity of equanimity $and mindfulness, dwells having attained the fourth absorption. 
$416$Division 14$Cultivating right attention, his mind moves on from the fourth absorption $to the sphere of infinite space, which is superior in calm and quietude.

$Again, a practitioner of the absorptions, by completely transcending $perceptions of form, with the cessation of perceptions of sensory impact, $unaware of perceptions of diversity, [being instead aware of] infinite space, $dwells having attained the sphere of infinite space. 
$Cultivating right attention, his mind moves on from the sphere of $infinite space to the sphere of infinite consciousness, which is superior in $calm and quietude.

At one time the Buddha was dwelling in the Kuru country, $at Kammāsadhamma, a town of the Kurus. 
$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $I will now teach you the Dharma that is excellent in the beginning, excellent $in the middle, and excellent in the end, with its meaning and phrasing, $endowed with purity, and revealing the holy life, which is called the “Dis￾course on Four Modes of Explanation.” $I will analyze the meaning [of the absorptions] according to the “Dis￾course on Four Modes of Explanation.” Listen closely, listen closely and $pay proper attention to what I will now teach you. 
$Then the monks listened to receive the instruction. 
The Buddha said: $How does one analyze the meaning according to the “Discourse on Four $Modes of Explanation”? $Suppose that by a [certain] practice, a [certain] characteristic, and a $[certain] mark, a monk dwells secluded from sensual desires, secluded $428$Division 14$from evil and unwholesome states, with [directed] awareness and [sus￾tained] contemplation, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion, $having attained the first absorption. 
$Yet, he does not keep to that practice, is not mindful of that characteristic $and that mark, but practices mindfulness and perception connected with $delight in sensual pleasures, and [thereby] fully regresses. 
$That monk should know: “This state having arisen in me, I will neither $remain [at my level of concentration] nor advance it, nor will I [develop] $disenchantment.

$At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: $A hunter who puts out fodder for deer does not have a state of mind like $438^taisho718b Division 14$this: “May the deer become fat! May they look good, be strong, be happy, $and live long!” A hunter who puts out fodder for deer has a state of mind $like this: “May they come close in order to eat it! Having come close to $eat, may they become careless and negligent! Having become negligent, $they will come under the sway of the hunter and the hunter’s following.”416$A hunter who puts out fodder for deer has a state of mind like this. 
$The first herd of deer came close in order to eat the hunter’s fodder. 
Having $come close in order to eat it, they became careless and negligent; and having 718c become negligent, they came under the sway of the hunter and the hunter’s $following. 
In this way that first herd of deer was unable to escape from the $territory [controlled by] the hunter and the hunter’s following. 
$A second herd of deer had this thought: “The first herd of deer came $close in order to eat the hunter’s fodder. 
Having come close in order to $eat it, they became careless and negligent; and having become negligent, $they came under the sway of the hunter and the hunter’s following.

$Monks, I have delivered this simile, wishing you to understand its $meaning. 
I will now explain how you should contemplate its meaning. 
$You should know that “the hunter’s fodder” stands for the five strands of $sensual pleasure: forms known by the eye, sounds known by the ear, odors $known by the nose, flavors known by the tongue, and tangibles known $by the body. 
You should know that “the hunter’s fodder” stands for these $five strands of sensual pleasure. 
$You should know that “the hunter” stands for the evil King Māra, and $you should know that “the hunter’s following” stands for King Māra’s $following. 
You should know that “the herd of deer” stands for renunciants $and brahmins. 
$Renunciants and brahmins of the first [type] come close in order to eat $King Māra’s fodder, [that is,] the almsfood offered by the faithful of the $world. 
Coming close in order to eat it, they become careless and negligent; $and in becoming negligent they come under the sway of King Māra and $King Māra’s following. 
$In this way renunciants and brahmins of the first [type] are unable to $escape from the territory [controlled by] King Māra. 
They are just like the $first herd of deer, which came close in order to eat the hunter’s fodder; and $having come close in order to eat it, became careless and negligent; and $having become negligent, came under the sway of the hunter and the hunter’s $following. 
In this way the first herd of deer was unable to escape from the $territory [controlled by] the hunter and the hunter’s following. 
Renunciants $and brahmins of the first [type] should be seen as also like this. 
$Renunciants and brahmins of a second [type] have this thought: “Renun￾ciants and brahmins of the first [type] come close in order to eat King $Māra’s fodder, [that is,] the almsfood offered by the faithful of the world. 
$Having come close in order to eat it, they become careless and negligent; $and having become negligent, they come under the sway of King Māra $and King Māra’s following. 
In this way renunciants and brahmins of the $first [type] are unable to escape from the territory [controlled by] King $Māra and King Māra’s following. 
Now let us forgo the almsfood offered $441$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$by the faithful of the world, avoiding it out of fear, and instead depend $on eating fruit and roots in the forest.” $Having had this thought, renunciants and brahmins of the second [type] $forgo the almsfood offered by the faithful of the world, avoiding it out of $fear, and instead depend on eating fruit and roots in the forest.

$However, they come to hold [either of] two views: the view of existence $or the view of nonexistence.419 Through holding [either of] these two views, $they come under the sway of King Māra and King Māra’s following.

$Renunciants and brahmins of the fourth [type] have this thought: $“Renunciants and brahmins of the first, second, and third [types] are all $unable to escape from the territory [controlled by] King Māra and King $Māra’s following.

$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the monks $were delighted and received it respectfully. 
$179. 
^ck The Discourse to the Carpenter $Pañcakaṅga424$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$At that time the carpenter Pañcakaṅga had left Sāvatthī at dawn and was $approaching the place where the Buddha was staying with the intention of $visiting the World-honored One and paying homage. 
$Then the carpenter Pañcakaṅga had this thought: “For the time being I $will put off visiting the Buddha. 
The World-honored One may be sitting in $meditation, and the venerable monks also. 
Let me now rather visit Mallikā’s $Single-halled Park for heterodox practitioners.” $Then, to divert and amuse himself, the carpenter Pañcakaṅga took the $path to the tinduka plantation, to visit Mallikā’s Single-halled Park for het￾erodox practitioners. 
$At that time in Mallikā’s Single-halled Park for heterodox practitioners $there was a heterodox practitioner, the renunciant Samaṇamuṇḍikāputta, a $great leader, teacher of a congregation, esteemed by the people, a teacher $leading a great community of five hundred heterodox practitioners. 
$He was in a noisy crowd that was creating a great uproar, noisily talking $various kinds of useless talk: talk about kings, talk about thieves, talk about $battles and quarrels, talk about food and drink, talk about robes and blankets, $talk about married women, talk about girls, talk about promiscuous women, $talk about the world, talk about evil ways, and talk about what is in the ocean. 
$They were gathered like this talking various kinds of useless talk. 
$446^taisho720b Division 14$Seeing the carpenter Pañcakaṅga coming in the distance, the heterodox prac￾titioner Samaṇamuṇḍikāputta personally admonished his own congregation: $Keep quiet! Be quiet, all of you! Do not speak another word! You should $collect and control yourselves. 
The carpenter Pañcakaṅga, a disciple of $the renunciant Gotama, is coming. 
$Among the lay disciples of the renunciant Gotama that live in Sāvatthī, $none surpasses the carpenter Pañcakaṅga. 
Why is that? He delights in $silence and praises silence. 
If he sees that this congregation is silent, $perhaps he will come here. 
$Then the heterodox practitioner Samaṇamuṇḍikāputta, having stopped $his congregation, remained silent himself. 
Then the carpenter Pañcakaṅga $approached the heterodox practitioner Samaṇamuṇḍikāputta, exchanged $greetings with him, stepped back, and sat to one side. 
$The heterodox practitioner Samaṇamuṇḍikāputta said: $Carpenter, if someone is endowed with four things, I describe him as accom￾plished in wholesomeness, foremost in wholesomeness, an unsurpassable $person who has attained the supreme essence, a true renunciant. 
$What are the four? He does not do evil deeds with the body, he does $not speak evil words with the mouth, he does not engage in wrong liveli￾hood, and he does not think evil thoughts. 
Carpenter, if someone is $endowed with these four things I describe him as accomplished in whole￾someness, foremost in wholesomeness, an unsurpassable person who has $attained the supreme essence, a true renunciant. 
$On hearing this statement made by the heterodox practitioner Samaṇa￾muṇḍikāputta, the carpenter Pañcakaṅga neither agreed nor disagreed. 
He $rose from his seat and left, [reflecting,] “I shall myself approach the Buddha $and ask about the meaning of this statement.” $He then approached the Buddha, paid homage with his head, stepped $back, and sat to one side. 
He told the Buddha the whole conversation he had $had with the heterodox practitioner Samaṇamuṇḍikāputta. 
$Having heard it, the World-honored One said: $Carpenter, if what the heterodox practitioner Samaṇamuṇḍikāputta said $were indeed the case, then a small infant with tender limbs, lying on its $447^taisho720c The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$back sleeping, would also be accomplished in wholesomeness, foremost $in wholesomeness, an unsurpassable person who has attained the supreme $essence, a true renunciant. 
$Carpenter, a small infant has, as yet, no perception of “body,” let alone $of “doing evil bodily deeds.” All it can do is move its body. 
$Carpenter, a small infant has, as yet, no perception of “mouth,” let $alone of “speaking evil words.” All it can do is cry. 
$Carpenter, a small infant has, as yet, no perception of “livelihood,” let $alone of “engaging in wrong livelihood.” All it can do is moan. 
$Carpenter, a small infant has, as yet, no perception of “thoughts,” let $alone of “thinking wrong thoughts.” All it can think of is the mother’s $milk.425$Carpenter, if it were as the heterodox practitioner Samaṇamuṇḍikāputta $proposes, then a small infant would be accomplished in wholesomeness, $foremost in wholesomeness, an unsurpassable person who has attained $the supreme essence, a true renunciant. 
$Carpenter, if someone is endowed with four things, I describe him as $accomplished in wholesomeness, as foremost in wholesomeness, but not $as an unsurpassable person, not as one who has attained the supreme $essence, not as a true renunciant.426$What are the four? He does not do evil deeds with the body, he does $not speak evil words with the mouth, he does not engage in wrong liveli￾hood, and he does not think evil thoughts. 
$Carpenter, if someone is endowed with these four things, I describe $him as accomplished in wholesomeness, as foremost in wholesomeness, $but not as an unsurpassable person, not as one who has attained the supreme $essence, not as a true renunciant. 
$Carpenter, bodily deeds and verbal deeds I refer to as being conduct. 
$Carpenter, thoughts I refer to as belonging to the mind and connected $with the mind. 
$Carpenter, I say one should know unwholesome conduct; one should $know from where unwholesome conduct arises; one should know where $unwholesome conduct ceases without remainder, where it is destroyed $without remainder; and one should know by what practice a noble disciple $brings about the cessation of unwholesome conduct.

$Carpenter, from where do unwholesome thoughts arise? I will declare $the place from which they arise. 
One should know that they arise from $perception. 
What kind of perception? I declare that perceptions are of $many kinds, of countless kinds, with various kinds of activities; they may $be perceptions of sensual desire, or perceptions of ill will, or perceptions $of harming. 
$Carpenter, because of perceptions based on the element of sensual $desire, there arise in living beings unwholesome thoughts that are connected $with the element of sensual desire. 
If there are [such] perceptions, [then] $because of those perceptions there arise unwholesome thoughts connected $with the element of sensual desire.

$Carpenter, because of perceptions based on the element of non-ill will $or the element of nonharming, there arise in living beings wholesome $thoughts that are connected with the element of non-ill will or the element $of nonharming.

A $452^taisho721c Division 14$noble disciple who practices like this comes to know as it really is the $cessation of wholesome thoughts. 
Why is that? $Based on right view arises right intention, based on right intention arises $right speech, based on right speech arises right action, based on right action $arises right livelihood, based on right livelihood arises right effort, based $on right effort arises right mindfulness, based on right mindfulness arises $right concentration.433 With a mind concentrated in this way, a noble disciple $attains liberation from all sensual desire, anger, and delusion. 
$Carpenter, a noble disciple who has rightly liberated the mind in this $way comes to know: “Birth has been ended, the holy life has been estab￾lished, what had to be done has been done; there will not be another expe￾riencing of existence.” He knows this as it really is.434$This is the path of one in training and with vision, which is endowed $with eight factors, while [that of] the arahant who has destroyed the taints $is endowed with ten factors.

$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the carpenter $Pañcakaṅga and the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.

^ck The Discourse to Gotamī435$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was dwelling among the Sakyans, $in the Nigrodha Park at Kapilavatthu. 
$At that time Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī approached the Buddha, holding a new $robe of yellow color made out of thread with a golden [hue].436 Having paid $453$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$homage with her head at the Buddha’s feet, she stepped back, sat to one side, $and said: $World-honored One, I have made this new robe myself out of yellow-col￾ored thread with a golden [hue] for the World-honored One. 
May he con￾descend to accept it, out of compassion for me. 
$The World-honored One said: $Gotamī, take this robe and offer it to the Sangha of monks. 
In offering it $to the Sangha of monks, you will be honoring and supporting me as well $as honoring and supporting the Sangha. 
$Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī made her request three times, saying: $World-honored One, I have made this new robe myself out of yellow-col￾ored thread with a golden [hue] for the World-honored One. 
May he con￾descend to accept it, out of compassion for me. 
$The World-honored One replied three times, saying: $Gotamī, take this robe and offer it to the Sangha of monks. 
In offering it $to the Sangha of monks, you will be honoring and supporting me as well $as honoring and supporting the Sangha. 
$At that time the venerable Ānanda was standing behind the Buddha, hold￾ing a whisk and attending on him. 
Then the venerable Ānanda said: $World-honored One, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī has been of much benefit to $the World-honored One. 
After the death of the World-honored One’s $mother she suckled and raised the World-honored One. 
$The World-honored One said: $Indeed, Ānanda. 
Indeed, Ānanda. 
Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī has been of much $benefit to me. 
After the death of my mother she suckled and raised me. 
$Ānanda, I have also been of much benefit to Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī.$437$Why is that? Because of me, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī took refuge in the $Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha of monks. 
She is free of doubt in $regard to the Three Jewels and in regard to dukkha, its arising, its cessation, $454^taisho722a Division 14$and the path [to its cessation]. 
She is accomplished in faith, morality, $much learning, generosity, and wisdom. 
She abstains from killing, having $abandoned killing; [she abstains] from taking what is not given ...
from $sexual misconduct ...
from false speech ...
and she abstains from alcoholic $beverages, having abandoned alcoholic beverages. 
$Ānanda, if because of a certain person one takes refuge in the Buddha, $the Dharma, and the Sangha of monks; [if one becomes] free of doubt in $regard to the Three Jewels and in regard to dukkha, its arising, its cessation, $and the path [to its cessation]; becomes accomplished in faith, morality, $much learning, generosity, and wisdom; abstains from killing, having $abandoned killing; [abstains] from taking what is not given ...
from sexual $misconduct ...
from false speech ...
and abstains from alcoholic bever￾ages, having abandoned alcoholic beverages—then one cannot possibly $repay the kindness of such a person even if, for one’s whole life, one were $to honor and support him with food and drink, robes and blankets, beds $and seats, medicines, and the various [other] kinds of requisites. 
$Again, Ānanda, there are seven [types of] offering to the Sangha and $fourteen [types of] offering to individuals that bring great merit, great $fruit, great virtue, great and extensive results.438 Ānanda, what are the $seven [types of] offering to the Sangha that bring great merit, great fruit, $great virtue, great and extensive results? $At a time when the Buddha is still in the world, a faithful clansman or $clanswoman makes offerings to the Buddha and to the Sangha of monks $headed by the Buddha.439 This is the first [type of] offering to the Sangha $that brings great merit, great fruit, great virtue, great and extensive results. 
$A faithful clansman or clanswoman makes offerings to the two com￾munities at a time not long after the World-honored One has attained final $nirvana ...

$455^taisho722b The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$Ānanda, at a future time there will be monks called “of the lineage,” $who are not diligent, who wear the yellow robe but are not diligent.441 I $say that when an offering is intentionally made to these [monks] who are $not diligent, then because [it is made] in dependence on the Sangha, $because [it is made] with the Sangha as its cause, because [it is made] in $honor of the Sangha, because [it is made] with the Sangha as its condition, $the donor will gain merit that is immeasurable, that cannot be counted or $calculated, attaining what is wholesome and pleasant. 
$What is to be said, then, of [offerings made] to monks in the present who $are accomplished in undertaking things, accomplished in discarding things, $accomplished in undertaking and discarding things; accomplished in upright￾ness, accomplished in gentleness, accomplished in uprightness and gentle￾ness; accomplished in patience, accomplished in joyfulness, accomplished $in patience and joyfulness; accomplished in being accommodating, accom￾plished in getting things done, accomplished in being accommodating and $getting things done; accomplished in decorum, accomplished in [proper $behavior when] going, coming, and remaining still, accomplished in decorum $and in [proper behavior when] going, coming, and remaining still; accom￾plished in faith, accomplished in morality, accomplished in much learning, $accomplished in generosity, accomplished in wisdom, accomplished in $faith, morality, much learning, generosity, and wisdom! $This is the seventh [type of] offering to the Sangha that brings great $merit, great fruit, great virtue, great and extensive results. 
These are the $seven [types of] offering to the Sangha that bring great merit, great fruit, $great virtue, great and extensive results. 
$Ānanda, what are the fourteen [types of] offering to individuals that $bring great merit, great fruit, great virtue, great and extensive results? $A faithful clansman or clanswoman makes an offering to the Tathā-$gata ...
makes an offering to a paccekabuddha ...

$456$Division 14$makes an offering to a diligent person ...
makes an offering to a person who $is not diligent ...
makes an offering to an animal. 
$Ānanda, making an offering to an animal brings hundredfold merit; making $an offering to a person who is not diligent brings thousandfold merit; making $an offering to a diligent person brings hundred-thousandfold merit; making $an offering to a non-Buddhist seer who is free of sensual desires brings hun￾dred thousand times hundred-thousandfold merit; making an offering to one $on the path to stream-entry brings immeasurable [merit]; making an offering $to a stream-enterer brings immeasurable [merit]; making an offering to one $on the path to once-returning brings immeasurable [merit]; making an offering $to a once-returner brings immeasurable [merit]; making an offering to one $on the path to nonreturning brings immeasurable [merit]; making an offering $to a nonreturner brings immeasurable [merit]; making an offering to one on $the path to arahantship brings immeasurable [merit]; making an offering to $an arahant brings immeasurable [merit]; making an offering to a pacceka -$buddha brings immeasurable [merit]; what is to be said of making an offering $to the Tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened! $These are the fourteen [types of] offering to individuals that bring great $merit, great fruit, great virtue, great and extensive results. 
$Again, Ānanda, there are four types of offering and three purifications $of gifts. 
What are the four? There is the offering that is purified on account $of the donor but not the recipient; there is the offering that is purified on $account of the recipient but not the donor; there is the offering that is not 722c purified on account of either the donor or the recipient; and there is the $offering that is purified on account of both the donor and the recipient. 
$Ānanda, what is the offering that is purified on account of the donor $but not the recipient? $The donor is diligent, they practice the sublime teachings, they look $toward the future, look toward the fruits [of deeds], they have such a view $and make such a declaration: “There is giving, and there are fruits of giving.” $The recipient is not diligent, they practice evil teachings, they do not look $toward the future, do not look toward the fruits [of deeds], they have such $a view and make such a declaration: “There is no giving, and there are $no fruits of giving.”442$457$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$This is the offering that is purified on account of the donor but not the $recipient. 
$Ānanda, what is the offering that is purified on account of the recipient $but not the donor? $The donor is not diligent, they practice evil teachings, they do not look $toward the future, do not look toward the fruits [of deeds], they have such $a view and make such a declaration: “There is no giving, and there are $no fruits of giving.” The recipient is diligent, they practice the sublime $teachings, they look toward the future, look toward the fruits [of deeds], $they have such a view and make such a declaration: “There is giving, and $there are fruits of giving.” $This is the offering that is purified on account of the recipient but not $the donor. 
$Ānanda, what is the offering that is not purified on account of either $the donor or the recipient? $The donor is not diligent, they practice evil teachings, they do not look $toward the future, do not look toward the fruits [of deeds], they have such $a view and make such a declaration: “There is no giving, and there are $no fruits of giving.” The recipient is also not diligent, they practice evil $teachings, they do not look toward the future, do not look toward the fruits $[of deeds], they have such a view and make such a declaration: “There is $no giving, and there are no fruits of giving.” $This is the offering that is not purified on account of either the donor $or the recipient. 
$Ānanda, what is the offering that is purified on account of both the $donor and the recipient? $The donor is diligent, they practice the sublime teachings, they look toward $the future, look toward the fruits [of deeds], they have such a view and make $such a declaration: “There is giving, and there are fruits of giving.” The $recipient is also diligent, they practice the sublime teachings, they look toward $the future, look toward the fruits [of deeds], they have such a view and make $such a declaration: “There is giving, and there are fruits of giving.” $This is the offering that is purified on account of both the donor and $the recipient. 
$458$Division 14$Then, the World-honored One spoke these stanzas: $A diligent one offers to one who is not diligent, $In accordance with the Dharma, attaining a joyful mind, $With faith that there are deeds and their results; $Such an offering is purified on account of the donor. 
$One who is not diligent offers to a diligent one, $Not in accordance with the Dharma and without a joyful mind, $Without faith in deeds and their results; $Such an offering is purified on account of the recipient. 
$A negligent one offers to one who is not diligent, $Not in accordance with the Dharma and without a joyful mind, $Without faith in deeds and their results; $Such an offering is not of great result. 
$A diligent one offers to one who is diligent, $In accordance with the Dharma, attaining a joyful mind, $With faith in deeds and their results; $Such an offering is of great result. 
$Male and female slaves and the poor443$Joyfully part with their own [property] to make an offering, $With faith in deeds and their results; $Such an offering is wholesome and people praise it. 
$With right restraint, with wholesome bodily and verbal [actions], $As he holds out [his bowl] when begging for alms according to $ the Dharma, $A dispassionate one makes an offering to a dispassionate one; $This is foremost among material offerings. 
$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the venerable $Ānanda and the monks were delighted and received it respectfully. 
$181. 
^ck The Discourse on Many Elements444$Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was living at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s $Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
$459^taisho723a The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$At that time the venerable Ānanda, who was seated in meditation alone $in a tranquil place, had this thought in his mind: “All fears, they arise from $foolishness, not from wisdom. 
All misfortunes, disasters, and worries, they $arise from foolishness, not from wisdom.” $Then, in the late afternoon, the venerable Ānanda rose from sitting in $meditation and approached the Buddha. 
Having paid homage with his head $at the Buddha’s feet, he stepped back, stood to one side, and said: $World-honored One, today [while] I was seated in meditation alone in a $tranquil place, I had this thought in my mind: “All fears, they arise from $foolishness, not from wisdom.445 All misfortunes, disasters, and worries, $they arise from foolishness, not from wisdom.” $The World-honored One said: $It is like this, Ānanda; it is like this, Ānanda. 
All fears, they arise from $foolishness, not from wisdom. 
All misfortunes, disasters, and worries, $they arise from foolishness, not from wisdom. 
$Ānanda, just as from a heap of reeds and grass a fire may start, [which $then] burns down a house or a hall, in the same way all fears, they arise $from foolishness, not from wisdom. 
All misfortunes, disasters, and worries, $they arise from foolishness, not from wisdom. 
$Ānanda, whatever fears there were in times past, they all arose from $foolishness, not from wisdom. 
All misfortunes, disasters, and worries, $they arose from foolishness, not from wisdom.446$Ānanda, whatever fears there will be in future times, they will all arise $from foolishness, not from wisdom. 
All misfortunes, disasters, and worries, $they will arise from foolishness, not from wisdom. 
$Ānanda, whatever fears there are at the present time, they all arise from $foolishness, not from wisdom. 
All misfortunes, disasters, and worries, $they arise from foolishness, not from wisdom. 
$This means, Ānanda, that with foolishness there is fear; with wisdom $there is no fear. 
With foolishness there are misfortunes, disasters, and $worries; with wisdom there are no misfortunes, disasters, or worries. 
$Ānanda, whatever fears, misfortunes, disasters, and worries exist, all of $them come from foolishness, not from wisdom. 
$460^taisho723b Division 14$Then the venerable Ānanda, moved to tears,447 extended his hands with $joined palms toward the Buddha and said, “World-honored One, how is a $monk foolish and not wise?”448$The World-honored One replied: $Ānanda, if a monk does not know the elements, does not know the sense $spheres, does not know causes and conditions, and does not know what $is possible and what is impossible—such a monk, Ānanda, is foolish and $not wise. 
$The venerable Ānanda said, “World-honored One, such a monk is foolish $and not wise. 
World-honored One, how is a monk wise and not foolish?” $The World-honored One replied: $Ānanda, if a monk knows the elements, knows the sense spheres, knows $causes and conditions, and knows what is possible and what is impossi￾ble—such a monk, Ānanda, is wise and not foolish. 
$The venerable Ānanda said, “World-honored One, such a monk is wise $and not foolish. 
World-honored One, how does a monk know the elements?” $The World-honored One replied: $Ānanda, a monk sees eighteen elements and knows them as they really $are: the eye element, the form element, and the eye consciousness element; $the ear element, the sound element, and the ear consciousness element; $the nose element, the odor element, and the nose consciousness element; $the tongue element, the taste element, and the tongue consciousness ele￾ment; the body element, the tangible element, and the body consciousness $element; the mind element, the mind object element, and the mind con￾sciousness element. 
Ānanda, he sees these eighteen elements and knows $them as they really are.449$Again, Ānanda, [a monk] sees six elements and knows them as they $really are: the earth element, the water element, the fire element, the wind $element, the space element, and the consciousness element. 
Ānanda, he $sees these six elements and knows them as they really are. 
$Again, Ānanda, [a monk] sees six elements and knows them as they $really are: the element of sensual desire, the element of ill will, the element $461$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$of harming, the element of absence of sensual desire, the element of non￾ill will, and the element of nonharming. 
Ānanda, he sees these six elements $and knows them as they really are. 
$Again, Ānanda, [a monk] sees six elements and knows them as they really $are: the element of pleasure, the element of pain, the element of joy, the ele￾ment of sadness, the element of equanimity, and the element of ignorance. 
$Ānanda, he sees these six elements and knows them as they really are. 
$Again, Ānanda, [a monk] sees four elements and knows them as they $really are: the element of feeling, the element of perception, the element $of formations, the element of consciousness. 
Ānanda, he sees these four $elements and knows them as they really are.450$Again, Ānanda, [a monk] sees three elements and knows them as they $really are: the sense sphere element, the [fine-]material element, and the $immaterial element. 
Ānanda, he sees these three elements and knows $them as they really are. 
$Again, Ānanda, [a monk] sees three elements and knows them as they $really are: the material element, the immaterial element, and the element $of cessation. 
Ānanda, he sees these three elements and knows them as $they really are. 
$Again, Ānanda, [a monk] sees three elements and knows them as they $really are: the element of the past, the element of the future, and the element $of the present. 
Ānanda, he sees these three elements and knows them as $they really are. 
$Again, Ānanda, [a monk] sees three elements and knows them as they $really are: the superior element, the inferior element, and the middling $element. 
Ānanda, he sees these three elements and knows them as they $really are. 
$Again, Ānanda, [a monk] sees three elements and knows them as they $really are: the wholesome element, the unwholesome element, and the $undetermined element. 
Ānanda, he sees these three elements and knows $them as they really are. 
$Again, Ānanda, [a monk] sees three elements and knows them as they $really are: the element of the trainee, the element of the one beyond training, $and the element of the one who is neither a trainee nor beyond training. 
$Ānanda, he sees these three elements and knows them as they really are. 
$462^taisho723c Division 14$Again, Ānanda, [a monk] sees two elements and knows them as they $really are: the element with taints and the element without taints. 
Ānanda, $he sees these two elements and knows them as they really are. 
$Again, Ānanda, [a monk] sees two elements and knows them as they $really are: the conditioned element and the unconditioned element. 
Ānanda, $he sees these two elements and knows them as they really are. 
$Ānanda, he sees these sixty-two elements and knows them as they $really are. 
Ānanda, this is how a monk knows the elements. 
$The venerable Ānanda said, “World-honored One, this is how a monk $knows the elements. 
World-honored One, how does a monk know the sense $spheres?” $The World-honored One replied: $Ānanda, a monk sees the twelve sense spheres and knows them as they $really are: the eye sense sphere and the form sense sphere; the ear sense $sphere and the sound sense sphere; the nose sense sphere and the odor $sense sphere; the tongue sense sphere and the taste sense sphere; the body $sense sphere and the tangible sense sphere; the mind sense sphere and the $mind object sense sphere. 
Ānanda, he sees these twelve sense spheres and $knows them as they really are. 
Ānanda, this is how a monk knows the $sense spheres. 
$The venerable Ānanda said, “World-honored One, this is how a monk $knows the sense spheres. 
How does a monk know causes and conditions?” $The World-honored One replied: $Ānanda, a monk sees causes and conditions as well as what has arisen $through causes and conditions, and he knows them as they really are. 
[He $knows:] dependent on this, that exists; if this does not exist, that does not $exist; if this arises, that arises; if this ceases, that ceases. 
That is to say: $conditioned by ignorance are formations ...
up to ...
conditioned by $birth are old age and death; if ignorance ceases, formations cease ...
up $to ...
if birth ceases, old age and death cease. 
Ānanda, this is how a monk $knows causes and conditions. 
$The venerable Ānanda said, “World-honored One, this is how a monk $463$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$knows causes and conditions. 
How does a monk know what is possible and $what is impossible?” $The World-honored One replied: $Ānanda, a monk sees what is possible as possible and knows it as it really $is; and he sees what is impossible as impossible and knows it as it really is. 
$Ānanda, it is not possible for there to be two wheel-turning monarchs $ruling in the world [at the same time]; [but] it is certainly possible for $there to be one wheel-turning monarch ruling in the world. 
$Ānanda, it is not possible for there to be two tathāgatas in the world $[at the same time]; [but] it is certainly possible for there to be one tathāgata $in the world. 
$Ānanda, it is not possible for a person who has seen the truth to inten￾tionally kill his father or mother, kill an arahant, cause a schism in the $noble Sangha, or, out of an evil mental disposition toward the Buddha, $cause the Tathāgata’s blood to flow; [but] it is certainly possible for an $ordinary worldling to intentionally kill his father or mother, kill an arahant, $cause a schism in the noble Sangha, or, out of an evil mental disposition $toward the Buddha, cause the Tathāgata’s blood to flow. 
$Ānanda, it is not possible for a person who has seen the truth to inten￾tionally violate the moral precepts, abandon the moral precepts, and stop $[practicing] the path; [but] it is certainly possible for an ordinary worldling $to intentionally violate the moral precepts, abandon the moral precepts, $and stop [practicing] the path.451 $It is [also] not possible for a person who has seen the truth to abandon $this [dispensation of the Buddha] and seek a perfected one, a field of merit, $outside of it; [but] it is certainly possible for an ordinary worldling to $abandon this [dispensation of the Buddha] and seek a perfected one, a $field of merit, outside of it. 
$Ānanda, it is not possible for a person who has seen the truth to declare $to non-Buddhist renunciants and brahmins: “Venerable sirs, you see what $can be seen and know what can be known”; [but] it is certainly possible for $an ordinary worldling to declare to non-Buddhist renunciants and brahmins: $“Venerable sirs, you see what can be seen and know what can be known.” $Ānanda, it is not possible for a person who has seen the truth to have $464^taisho724a Division 14$faith in divination and to inquire about auspicious and inauspicious [omens]; $[but] it is certainly possible for an ordinary worldling to have faith in div￾ination and to inquire about auspicious and inauspicious [omens].

$Ānanda, it is not possible that a person who has seen the truth, on expe￾riencing extreme pain, severe pain, pain that is not [at all] agreeable, not $[at all] pleasurable, not [at all] wished for, unthinkable pain that is even $life threatening, should abandon this and seek outside [the Buddha’s dis￾pensation] for some renunciant or brahmin who might know a spell con￾sisting of one verse, [or] of two verses, three verses, four verses, many $verses, [even] a spell consisting of a hundred-thousand verses, [thinking,] $“This will free me from my suffering,” [rather than] seeking [insight into] $dukkha, the arising of dukkha, the path [leading to the cessation of] dukkha, $and the cessation of dukkha; [but] it is certainly possible that an ordinary $worldling [on similarly experiencing such pain] should abandon this and $seek outside [the Buddha’s dispensation] for some renunciant or brahmin $who might know a spell consisting of one verse, [or] of two verses, three $verses, four verses, many verses, [even] a spell consisting of a hundred $thousand verses, [thinking,] “This will free me from my suffering,” [rather $than] seeking [insight into] dukkha, the arising of dukkha, the path [leading $to the cessation of] dukkha, and the cessation of dukkha.452$Ānanda, it is not possible for a person who has seen the truth to expe￾rience [rebirth into] an eighth existence; [but] it is certainly possible for $an ordinary worldling to experience [rebirth into] an eighth existence.453$Ānanda, it is not possible that, on account of evil conduct of body, $speech, and mind, because of this, [one] should, when the body breaks up 724b at death, proceed to a good destination, being reborn in a heavenly realm; $[but] it is certainly possible that, on account of evil conduct of body, speech, $465$The Madhyama Āgama (Middle-length Discourses), Volume III$and mind, because of this, [one] should, when the body breaks up at death, $proceed to a bad destination, being reborn in a hellish realm.

$Ānanda, this is how a monk knows what is possible and what is $impossible. 
$The venerable Ānanda said, “World-honored One, this is how a monk $knows what is possible and what is impossible.” $Then the venerable Ānanda extended his hands with joined palms toward $the Buddha and said, “World-honored One, what is the name of this discourse? $How should we remember it?” $The World-honored One said: $Ānanda, you should remember this [discourse] as “Many Elements, $“Dharma Elements,” “Elements of the Deathless,” “Many Drums,” $“Dharma Drum,” “Drum of the Deathless,” “Mirror of the Dharma,” “Four $Sections.” For this reason, call this discourse by the name “Many Ele￾ments.”455$Thus spoke the Buddha. 
Having heard what the Buddha said, the venerable $Ānanda and the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.$467$469$Notes$Division 11 $1 The Pāli parallel is the Raṭṭhapāla-sutta, MN 82 at MN II 54; for a comparative study, $see Bhikkhu Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya (Taipei: Dharma $Drum Publishing Corporation, 2011), pp. 
451–466. 
$2 In the Raṭṭhapāla-sutta the parents try three times to convince the fasting Raṭṭhapāla $before enlisting the help of his friends. 
$3 The Raṭṭhapāla-sutta does not mention an attempt to enlist yet another group of $friends, although in relation to the first group it reports that these tried three times in $succession to convince the fasting Raṭṭhapāla to change his mind. 
$4 The Raṭṭhapāla-sutta does not specify how much time had elapsed. 
$5 In the Raṭṭhapāla-sutta the Buddha simply gives him permission, without any further $instructions that he should rescue others. 
$6 In the Raṭṭhapāla-sutta she informs the mother. 
$7 The Raṭṭhapāla-sutta reports no apology by the father. 
When Raṭṭhapāla refuses to $come along to the house right away, as he has already had his meal, the father invites $him for a meal the next day. 
$8 In the Raṭṭhapāla-sutta it is the father who arranges a heap of the coins and invites $Raṭṭhapāla to disrobe, and who tells his former wives to dress up. 
$9 In the Raṭṭhapāla-sutta he does not announce his attainment of liberation. 
On hearing $him address them as “sisters,” his former wives faint. 
$10 The Raṭṭhapāla-sutta does not report a departure by supernormal means. 
$11 In the Raṭṭhapāla-sutta the king invites Raṭṭhapāla to sit on his elephant rug, which $Raṭṭhapāla declines. 
$12 This first exchange has no counterpart in the Raṭṭhapāla-sutta, where the king directly $takes up the topic of the four kinds of deterioration. 
$13 In the Raṭṭhapāla-sutta the king mentions first old age and then disease. 
$14 Adopting a variant that adds 謂. 
Here and below, in the Raṭṭhapāla-sutta the rationale $for going forth is the inability to acquire or increase wealth. 
$469$Notes$15 The text reads 欲, literally “desire,” which according to Akira Hirakawa, Buddhist $Chinese-Sanskrit Dictionary (Tokyo: Reiyukai, 1997), p. 
673, can also render abhipreta, $“intended, accepted,” a nuance of meaning that fits the present context better. 
$16 The four maxims in the Raṭṭhapāla-sutta take up the basic themes that the world is $unstable, offers no shelter, has nothing of its own, and is unsatisfactory. 
$17 In the Raṭṭhapāla-sutta, where this is the second topic of discussion, the king only $mentions the four parts of his army. 
$18 In the Raṭṭhapāla-sutta the king does not mention karmic retribution. 
$19 In the Raṭṭhapāla-sutta the king replies that he will leave all his possessions behind $and pass on according to his karma. 
$20 The Raṭṭhapāla-sutta ends with the last of Raṭṭhapāla’s verses and does not report $the king’s delight. 
$21 The Pāli parallel is the Upāli-sutta, MN 56 at MN I 371; for a comparative study see $Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
320–333. 
$22 罰, literally “punishment,” corresponding to daṇḍa, which in the present context $would have the sense of “restraint.” $23 The corresponding simile in the Upāli-sutta is the third and involves shaking a strainer. 
$24 The simile in the Upāli-sutta does not mention a man washing the elephant. 
$25 The corresponding argument in the Upāli-sutta is the second and involves a Jaina $who undertakes the fourfold restraint. 
$26 The corresponding argument in the Upāli-sutta is the first and involves a Jaina who $is sick. 
$27 The Upāli-sutta lists the Daṇḍaka, Kāliṅga, Mejjha, and Mātaṅga forests. 
$28 In the Upāli-sutta he replies right away and thus without remaining silent and without $being pressed by the Buddha to reply. 
$29 In the Upāli-sutta his conversion takes place earlier, as he explains that he had already $been convinced by the Buddha’s first argument and had continued just for the sake $of having a discussion. 
$30 In the Upāli-sutta the Buddha advises him to reflect carefully (about his decision to $convert). 
$31 The Upāli-sutta does not report the Buddha explicitly stating his position on how $gifts should be given. 
$32 Here and below, the Upāli-sutta does not depict Nātaputta as needing to be reminded $of what had been said earlier. 
$470$Notes$33 Here and below, in the Upāli-sutta Nātaputta states three times that it is impossible $for Upāli to be converted by the Buddha. 
$34 Here and below, in the Upāli-sutta Dīghatapassin does not suggest that Nātaputta $should go and find out himself. 
$35 Adopting the variant 施 instead of 抱. 
$36 Such a remark and a reply by Upāli affirming his ownership of the seats is not found $in the Upāli-sutta.$37 The text appears to involve a word play on akkha, which can mean “eye” as well as $“myrobalan fruit.” In the Upāli-sutta this is the second simile used by Nātaputta; the first $seems to involve a word play on aṇḍa, which can mean “egg” or “testicle.” $38 In the Upāli-sutta at this juncture Nātaputta refers to the Buddha’s converting magic, $which in MĀ 133 comes after Upāli has delivered his simile of the monkey. 
$39 Here and below the dyer, whom the Upāli-sutta introduces by name, does not speak $a verse. 
$40 The translation is based on emending 祠 to 祀. 
$41 Adopting the variant 歎 instead of 難. 
This stanza, apparently spoken by the reciters $of the discourse, has no counterpart in the Upāli-sutta.$42 The Upāli-sutta does not report that Nātaputta died; that information is found only $in the commentary, Ps III 100. 
$43 The Pāli parallel is the Sakkapañha-sutta, DN 21 at DN II 263. 
$44 Several of the verses in the Sakkapañha-sutta differ. 
$45 Adopting the variant 活 instead of 沽. 
$46 In the Sakkapañha-sutta she instead tells Sakka that it is not the time for him to visit $the Buddha. 
$47 In the Sakkapañha-sutta Gopaka first rebukes them in prose. 
Several of the ensuing $verses differ from those found in MĀ 134. 
$48 非法, which usually renders adharma. 
Yet if their practice had been adharma, they $would not have been reborn in any heaven; therefore the meaning “inappropriate” $seems to fit the context better. 
$49 Adopting the variant 子 instead of 等. 
$50 On Vāsava (婆娑婆) as one of the many names of the ruler of the devas (along with $Sakka, Kosiya, Indra, etc.), see Marcus Bingenheimer, Studies in Āgama Literature, $With Special Reference to the Shorter Chinese Saṃyuktāgama (Taiwan: Shin Weng $Feng Print Co., 2011), p. 
194f. 
$471$Notes$51 The Sakkapañha-sutta traces thought back not to intention but to perceptions and $notions (related to) conceptual proliferation. 
$52 The Sakkapañha-sutta does not mention the noble eightfold path at this juncture. 
Instead $the Buddha expounds two types of joy, of sadness, and of equanimity, which are either $to be pursued or not to be pursued—a topic taken up later in MĀ 134. 
$53 The corresponding section of the Sakkapañha-sutta discusses two kinds of bodily $conduct, of verbal conduct, and of pursuits. 
Here and below, the Pāli version does $not specify that the wholesome types of any of these should be done at the right time $with mindfulness and comprehension. 
$54 In the Sakkapañha-sutta the previous discussion was on the topic of restraint by the $code of rules, whereas the present one is concerned with restraint of the sense faculties. 
$55 In the Sakkapañha-sutta a corresponding exposition is given by Sakka, who has under￾stood the matter on hearing the brief introductory remark by the Buddha. 
$56 No reference to the momentary nature of the path is found in the Sakkapañha-sutta. 
$57 In the Sakkapañha-sutta Sakka directly relates his past encounters with other recluses, $without reporting a meeting in the Heaven of the Thirty-three, the devas’ indulgence $in sensuality, or distress arising from witnessing another deva passing away. 
$58 The translation is based on emending 曾 to 未曾. 
According to the original reading, the $renunciant or brahmin affirms having “formerly,” 曾, met Sakka, which in the narrative $context fails to make sense, since it is clearly the first time of such meeting. 
$59 No explanation of Sakka’s name is given in the Sakkapañha-sutta.$60 A comparable set of verses (although with several differences) occurs later in the $Sakkapañha-sutta; at the present juncture Sakka instead proclaims his attainment of $stream-entry. 
$61 In the Sakkapañha-sutta such a question by the Buddha is preceded by Sakka pro￾claiming his stream-entry. 
$62 The Sakkapañha-sutta has a comparable description by Sakka only in verse, introduced $by distinguishing six occasions for rejoicing. 
$63 The Sakkapañha-sutta does not report an inquiry by the Buddha regarding Sakka’s $attainment of stream-entry. 
Consequently, it also has no verse reply by Sakka to this $inquiry. 
$64 Adopting a variant according to which “sentient beings” occurs only once. 
$65 The Sakkapañha-sutta does not report Sakka referring to Brahmā, nor does it have $verses spoken by Brahmā. 
$66 The Pāli parallel is the Sigālaka-sutta (or Siṅgalovāda-sutta), DN 31 at DN III 180, $which has the Squirrels’ Sanctuary in the Bamboo Grove by Rājagaha as its location; $472$Notes for a comparative study, see Bhadanta Pannasiri, “Sigālovāda-Sutta,” Visva-Bharati $Annals 3 (1950): 150–228. 
$67 In the Pāli version his name is Si(ṅ)gālaka. 
$68 The Sigālaka-sutta begins by describing his paying homage and has a reference to $his father’s instruction only as part of Sigālaka’s reply to an inquiry by the Buddha. 
$69 In the Sigālaka-sutta the Buddha points out that this is not the way to pay respect to $the six directions according to the discipline of the noble ones, without mentioning $the prospect of being respected and having a good rebirth. 
$70 The six problems of gambling, which is the fourth topic in the Sigālaka-sutta, do not $include uneasy sleep or the happiness of one’s enemies; instead it mentions the prob￾lems of loss of wealth and of not being wanted for marriage. 
$71 Here and below the text refers to 妻子, which can mean “wife and children” but also $just “wife.” The context of subsequent occurrences makes it clear that the second of $these two senses is appropriate here. 
$72 The verses in the Sigālaka-sutta show several differences, although touching on the $same main themes. 
$73 The Sigālaka-sutta only has a verse summary after all four enemies in disguise have $been expounded in prose. 
$74 The exposition of the four type of friends in the Sigālaka-sutta shows several differ￾ences. 
$75 The Sigālaka-sutta differs in identifying friends with the north and servants with the $nadir. 
The exposition of each also shows several differences. 
Throughout, this expo￾sition in the Sigālaka-sutta adopts the pattern of listing five qualities in each case, $unlike MĀ 135, which has thirteen qualities for a wife and nine for servants. 
$76 The Sigālaka-sutta does not mention four ways of caring. 
$77 Adopting the variant 護無貢 instead of 獲無功. 
$78 The original speaks of only four parts, even though the ensuing verse mentions six. 
$79 In the Sigālaka-sutta the householder asks to be accepted as a lay disciple. 
$80 The Pāli parallel is the Valahassa-jātaka, Jā 196 at Jā II 127. 
$81 In the Valahassa-jātaka she had secretly gone out at night to eat some of the formerly $caught merchants. 
The wise merchant noticed that her body was cold from having $been secretly out at night and realized what was going on. 
The Pāli version has no $counterpart to the ensuing tale in MĀ 136 of the wise merchant secretly visiting the $place where the formerly caught merchants were kept imprisoned. 
$82 As in the previous discourse, 妻子 is just rendered “wife” or “wives.” $473$Notes$83 In the Valahassa-jātaka the wise merchant and half of the group who are willing to heed $his words run away and happen to encounter the horse, which is identified as a former $life of the Buddha. 
The horse carries the whole group to safety, so that here only those $who did not heed the wise merchant’s advice to escape are eventually devoured by the $female yakkhas, once a new group of shipwrecked merchants has arrived. 
$84 Instead of functioning as an illustration of the not-self teaching, in the Valahassa￾jātaka the tale serves as a warning to a monk who is infatuated by a woman. 
$85 The Pāli parallel is the Loka-sutta, AN 4.23 at AN II 23, found again in It 112 at $It 121. 
$86 The Loka-sutta continues by proclaiming that the Tathāgata speaks as he acts and $acts as he speaks; it does not have the comparison to a lion in its prose section, but $only among the verses spoken by the Buddha. 
Although touching on similar themes, $these verses show several differences from MĀ 137. 
$87 Adopting the variant 知 instead of 如. 
$88 Adopting the variant 有 instead of 真. 
$89 The verses in the Loka-sutta conclude on the theme of homage and have no counterpart $to the ensuing verse in MĀ 137. 
$90 The Pāli parallel is the second part of the Pacalāyamāna-sutta, AN 7.58 at AN IV $88. 
(The PTS edition seems to have conflated two separate discourses, the Pacalāya -$māna-sutta, AN 7.58 at AN IV 85 to 88, which corresponds to MĀ 83, and the second $part AN IV 88 to 91, which is a parallel to the present discourse, MĀ 138.) $91 The (second part of the) Pacalāyamāna-sutta does state that lack of merits is dukkha. 
$92 The (second part of the) Pacalāyamāna-sutta does not give the name of the wheel￾turning king and does not have a counterpart to the detailed description of his various $possessions. 
Comparable descriptions can be found in the Mahāsudassana-sutta, DN $17 at DN II 187, and in the Gomaya-sutta, SN 22.96 at SN III 144. 
$93 The verses at the end of the Pacalāyamāna-sutta show several differences. 
$94 The Pāli parallel is the Jīvika-sutta, It 91 at It 89, an exposition also found in the latter $part of the Piṇḍolyaṃ-sutta, SN 22.80 at SN III 93. 
$95 The Jīvika-sutta and the Piṇḍolyaṃ-sutta have no counterpart to this comparison, $but only to the later comparison to a piece of wood from a cremation fire. 
$96 The Jīvika-sutta instead proclaims in verse that for such a one it would be better to $swallow a burning iron ball instead of partaking of offerings without being restrained. 
$97 The Pāli parallels are a series of discourses in the repetition section of the Magga￾saṃyutta, beginning at SN V 43, with the comparison to the elephant’s footprint found $in SN 45.140, to the roof peak in SN 45.141, to a type of root in SN 45.142, to san￾dalwood in SN 45.143, to jasmine in SN 45.144, to the wheel-turning king in SN $474$Notes$45.145, to the moon in SN 45.146, and to types of cloth in SN 45.148 (which unlike $MĀ 141 reckons Kāsī cloth as supreme). 
$Division 12$98 The Pāli parallel for the first part of MĀ 142 is the Vassakāra-sutta, AN 7.20 at AN $IV 17, and for the remainder of MĀ 142 the parallels are discourses AN 7.21 to AN $7.25 at AN IV 21; see also the Mahāparinibbāna-sutta, DN 16 at DN II 72. 
$99 In the Vassakāra-sutta the Buddha directly turns to Ānanda and addresses his entire $exposition to him, only turning to Vassakāra at the end of his exposition of the seven $principles of non-decline. 
$100 In the Vassakāra-sutta, where this principle occurs before the one concerned with $not abducting women, the respect and esteem is given to elders. 
$101 The Vassakāra-sutta does not mention support with requisites. 
$102 The Vassakāra-sutta concludes at this point. 
$103 The ensuing exposition has a counterpart in AN 7.21 at AN IV 21; see also DN 16 $at DN II 76. 
$104 AN 7.21 concludes at this point. 
$105 A list of seven types of respect as a factor preventing decline is also found in AN $7.56 at AN IV 84, although with the difference that all four assemblies should have $such respect, not only the monks. 
$106 The ensuing exposition has a counterpart in AN 7.22 at AN IV 22; see also DN 16 $at DN II 77. 
$107 The ensuing exposition has a counterpart in AN 7.23 at AN IV 22; see also DN 16 $at DN II 78. 
$108 The ensuing exposition has a counterpart in AN 7.24 at AN IV 23; see also DN 16 $at DN II 79. 
$109 The seven principles for settling a monastic dispute are discussed in more detail in $MĀ 196 (in which case they are also found in the Pāli parallel, the Sāmagāma-sutta, $MN 104 at MN II 247). 
$110 The ensuing exposition has a counterpart in DN 16 at DN II 80. 
$111 The Pāli parallel is the Saṅgārava-sutta, AN 3.60 at AN I 168. 
$112 In the Saṅgārava-sutta the Buddha replies by describing the arising of a tathāgata $and his teaching others the path to liberation. 
$113 In the Saṅgārava-sutta the topic of their discussion is that formerly there were fewer $monks but more of them performed supernormal feats. 
In reply the Buddha expounds $the three types of miracles. 
$475$Notes$114 The miracle of instruction in the Saṅgārava-sutta consists only in instructions on how $to think and give attention, and on what should be abandoned or established in the mind. 
$115 In relation to this and the following miracle in the Saṅgārava-sutta, Saṅgārava com￾ments that they appear to him like magical tricks. 
$116 In the Saṅgārava-sutta the Buddha rather seems to censure him for having stated that $he thinks the Buddha has the ability to perform these three miracles. 
$117 The Pāli parallel is the Gaṇakamoggallāna-sutta, MN 107 at MN III 1; for a com￾parative study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
618–$623. 
$118 The brahmin in the Gaṇakamoggallāna-sutta does not mention horse and elephant $trainers, although the Buddha in his reply refers to horse trainers. 
$119 The Gaṇakamoggallāna-sutta instead speaks of observance of the monastic rules. 
It $does not have a counterpart to the ensuing description in MĀ 144 of satipaṭṭhāna meditation. 
$120 After sense restraint, the Gaṇakamoggallāna-sutta describes moderation with food $and the practice of wakefulness, before turning to clear comprehension with bodily $activities. 
$121 The Gaṇakamoggallāna-sutta also mentions eating, drinking, consuming food, tasting, $defecating, and urinating. 
$122 Here and below adopting the variant 耳 instead of 耶. 
$123 The simile of the sāla grove is not found in the Gaṇakamoggallāna-sutta.$124 The Gaṇakamoggallāna-sutta has three comparisons: black orris as the best of roots, $sandalwood as the best of woods, and jasmine as the best of flower perfumes. 
In the $Pāli version the brahmin then illustrates the nature of the exposition he has received $with a standard set of similes that describe setting upright what had been overturned, $revealing what was hidden, etc. 
$125 The Pāli parallel is the Gopakamoggallāna-sutta, MN 108 at MN III 7; for a comparative $study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
623–630. 
$126 Instead of mentioning the Vajjis, the Gopakamoggallāna-sutta reports that the king $of Magadha was apprehensive of King Pajjota. 
$127 Adopting a variant that adds 欲. 
$128 In the Gopakamoggallāna-sutta Ānanda replies that there is not a single monk equal $to the Buddha. 
$129 The translation follows an emendation in the CBETA edition. 
The original speaks of $gathering in “two” places, which in the present context does not make sense. 
$130 The Gopakamoggallāna-sutta does not mention the giving of a talk on the Dharma. 
$476$Notes$131 Following these first two qualities, the remainder of the list of ten qualities in the $Gopakamoggallāna-sutta is rather different, with the two versions agreeing only on con￾tentment and the destruction of the taints. 
Six qualities mentioned only in the Pāli version $are attaining the four absorptions and each of the five higher knowledges. 
$132 Although the Gopakamoggallāna-sutta does mention contentment, which is its third $quality, it does not illustrate this with the simile of a bird taking along just its two $wings (a simile found elsewhere also among Pāli discourses). 
$133 Instead of an exclamation by the assembled crowd, the Gopakamoggallāna-sutta reports a remark made by Vassakāra to the general Upananda on the appropriateness $of respecting a monk endowed with the ten qualities listed earlier. 
$134 Adopting the variant 整 instead of 政. 
$135 The Gopakamoggallāna-sutta does not mention the absence of insect pests. 
Instead of $referring to the Buddha’s commending of the Squirrel’s Sanctuary, it reports that Ānanda $acknowledged the protection of the Squirrel’s Sanctuary afforded by Vassakāra. 
$136 The Gopakamoggallāna-sutta does not report this remark by the general Upananda. 
$137 The location mentioned in the Gopakamoggallāna-sutta by Vassakāra is the Kūṭagāra $in the Mahāvana by Vesālī. 
$138 The term employed in the Gopakamoggallāna-sutta is jhāna, which here clearly stands $for meditation in general, not for the recognized stages of concentrative absorption. 
$139 The supplementation is guided by the fact that the text lacks a reference to the hindrance $of restlessness-and-worry, which, besides being mentioned in the Gopakamoggallāna￾sutta, MN III 14, is clearly required by the context. 
$140 Here and below, the original speaks of “fourth” or “four,” which is related to the error $mentioned in the previous footnote and may have been due to influence from the $correct occurrence of “four” in the next exposition on praiseworthy application of $the mind, which is the four absorptions. 
$141 Adopting the variant 憎 instead of 增. 
$142 In the Gopakamoggallāna-sutta he clarifies that he has already replied to the question $(which in the Pāli version he does before Vassakāra’s arrival). 
The Gopakamoggallāna￾sutta concludes here, so it has no counterpart for the next question and the meal $offering reported in MĀ 145. 
$143 Adopting the variant 二 instead of 三. 
$144 The Pāli parallel is the Cūḷahatthipadopama-sutta, MN 27 at MN I 175; for a comparative $study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
189–192. 
$145 The Cūḷahatthipadopama-sutta does not report Pilotika’s visit to the Buddha, beginning $instead with his meeting with Jāṇussoṇi, which takes place at midday. 
$477$Notes$146 Adopting the variant 誦 instead of 讀. 
The Cūḷahatthipadopama-sutta does not mention $for what purpose Jāṇussoṇi was driving out of Sāvatthī. 
$147 The Cūḷahatthipadopama-sutta has no reference to four principles found in the sacred $texts. 
$148 Here and below, in the Cūḷahatthipadopama-sutta they even become the Buddha’s $disciples. 
$149 In the Cūḷahatthipadopama-sutta he speaks of this, along with the other three reasons, $as a “footprint.” $150 Abstention from alcohol is not explicitly mentioned in the Cūḷahatthipadopama-sutta. 
$151 The Cūḷahatthipadopama-sutta additionally mentions abstention from accepting raw $meat, from going on messages, from buying and selling, from cheating with false $weights and measures, etc., from accepting bribes and fraud, and from murder, brig￾andage, and violence. 
$152 Adopting the variant 掘 instead of 屈. 
$153 According to the Cūḷahatthipadopama-sutta, this is a footprint of the Tathāgata. 
$154 The Cūḷahatthipadopama-sutta describes attainment of all three higher knowledges, $including recollection of past lives and the divine eye. 
$155 In the Cūḷahatthipadopama-sutta he illustrates the nature of the exposition he has $received with a standard set of similes: setting upright what had been overturned, $revealing what was hidden, etc. 
$156 This set of verses has a parallel in the otherwise different Sumanā-sutta, AN 5.31 at $AN III 34. 
$157 The Pāli parallel is the Khattiya-sutta, AN 6.52 at AN III 362. 
$158 According to the Khattiya-sutta, warriors have strength (bala) as their support, they $rely on territory (paṭhavī), and their end (or final goal) is sovereignty (issariya). 
$159 In relation to renunciants, the Khattiya-sutta mentions patience and mildness instead $of truth, and nothingness instead of secluded places. 
$160 The Pāli parallel is the Esukārī-sutta, MN 96 at MN II 177, which has Jeta’s Grove $at Sāvatthī as its location; for a comparative study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study $of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
563–566. 
$161 In the Esukārī-sutta the Buddha instead queries if the whole world had authorized $the brahmins to prescribe these four types of services. 
$162 The translation follows an emendation of 直 to 值, suggested in the Foguang edition $of MĀ 150. 
$163 A comparable exposition by the Buddha in the Esukārī-sutta does not take the form $of a question-and-answer exchange. 
$478$Notes$164 In the Esukārī-sutta the Buddha points out that even someone having a high social $position or endowed with much wealth can commit unwholesome conduct. 
$165 Instead of inability to watch over cows, the Esukārī-sutta speaks of taking something $by theft. 
$166 The Esukārī-sutta instead mentions sickle and carrying pole for the case of the worker. 
$167 As in relation to the previous topic, here again the Buddha in the Esukārī-sutta instead $queries if the whole world had authorized the brahmins to prescribe these four types $of property or wealth. 
$168 In the Esukārī-sutta the Buddha just mentions the noble supramundane Dharma, fol￾lowed by comparing the four castes to fires that burn in dependence on different mate￾rials and noting that members of all four castes can go forth under him and become $accomplished in the Dharma. 
$169 The topic of being affected by empty space is not covered in the Esukārī-sutta. 
$170 In the Esukārī-sutta the simile of being able to wash oneself clean does not involve $a hundred types of people, which in the Pāli version are only mentioned in the simile $about the ability to make a fire. 
$171 This additional query about employing different fuel to feed the fire is not found in $the Esukārī-sutta.$172 The Pāli parallel is the Assalāyana-sutta, MN 93 at MN II 147; for a comparative $study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
549–556. 
$173 The Assalāyana-sutta does not report the brahmins’ claims to superiority, but only $their wish to dispute the Buddha’s proclamation of purification for all four castes. 
$174 The Assalāyana-sutta speaks of only three Vedas. 
$175 In the Assalāyana-sutta he agrees only after they have made their request three times. 
$176 In the Assalāyana-sutta, before referring to the two-class society in Yona and Kamboja, $the Buddha points out that brahmin women are seen to become pregnant, which con￾tradicts the claim that brahmins are born from Brahmā’s mouth. 
$177 In the Assalāyana-sutta the Buddha does not draw out the implications of the example $of the two-class society in this way. 
Instead, here and below after other arguments, $he questions what then constitutes the basis for the brahmins’ claim to superiority. 
$178 Here and below, the Assalāyana-sutta contains no acknowledgement of the Buddha’s $ability in swiftly coming out with a simile. 
$179 The topic of being affected by empty space is not covered in the Assalāyana-sutta. 
$180 In the Assalāyana-sutta the Buddha, before referring to the ability to practice lov￾ing-kindness, makes two arguments based on both retribution for evil and reward for $restraint being independent of one’s caste. 
$479$Notes$181 The simile of being able to wash oneself in the Assalāyana-sutta does not involve a $hundred types of people, which in the Pāli version are only mentioned in the simile $about the ability to make a fire. 
$182 This additional argument related to classifying fires according to the fuel used to feed $them is not found in the Assalāyana-sutta.$183 Before coming to the tale of the seers of the past, the Assalāyana-sutta has a simile $involving brothers, found later in MĀ 151. 
$184 Adopting the variant 屧 instead of 變. 
$185 In the Assalāyana-sutta he also speaks, asking where the brahmin seers have gone. 
$186 Instead of inquiring about the identity of their unexpected visitor, in the Assalāyana￾sutta they think that their asceticism is in vain, whereupon Asita tells them that this $is not the case and that they should let go of their hatred toward him. 
$187 In the Assalāyana-sutta they are instead not sure that their mothers only cohabited $with a brahmin. 
$188 Asita’s question in the Assalāyana-sutta is just about the caste of the one to be born. 
$189 Instead of referring to their clothing, in the Assalāyana-sutta the Buddha remarks $that Assalāyana and his teachers are not even fit to be the spoon-holder of those seers. 
$190 The corresponding simile in the Assalāyana-sutta (found before the tale of the seers) $speaks of two brothers only. 
$191 Instead of Assalāyana being prevented from paying respect, the Assalāyana-sutta describes his sitting in silent embarrassment at this point. 
It does not report that $Assalāyana received an additional teaching on the Dharma from the Buddha or that $he was later rebuked by the other brahmins for not standing his ground in debate. 
$192 The reference appears to involve a word play on akkha, translated here as 眼, which $can mean “eye” as well as “myrobalan fruit.” $193 The Pāli parallel is the Subha-sutta, MN 99 at MN II 196, which has Jeta’s Grove at $Sāvatthī as its location; for a comparative study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study $of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
572–579. 
$194 鸚鵡, “parrot,” corresponding to Suka, which must go back to an original that differs $from the name of this brahmin in the Pāli parallel, which is instead Subha. 
$195 The Subha-sutta does not describe the Buddha’s dignified appearance or compare it $to the moon. 
$196 In the Subha-sutta the Buddha on his own announces that he will give an analytical $exposition, vibhajjavāda, without being asked to do so by his visitor. 
$197 Here and below, the Subha-sutta does not provide a contrast to one-sided truth claims. 
$480$Notes$198 The text here uses the expression 熱行, but recapitulations of the list of five principles $later in MĀ 152 instead speak of 行施, “practice of generosity,” which judging from $the context must be the correct sense in the present passage as well; see also Anālayo, $A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, p. 
576, n. 
238. 
In fact, the Subha-sutta $names the same five principles, including generosity, differing only in the sequence $of listing them. 
$199 Here and below, the Subha-sutta does not record a rebuttal by the young brahmin $until after the Buddha has delivered the simile of the blind people, who in the Pāli $version are not specified as children. 
$200 In the Subha-sutta the Buddha queries if these brahmins should not better make state￾ments that accord with conventions, that are made thoughtfully, after reflection, and $that are beneficial. 
$201 The Subha-sutta instead lists the five hindrances. 
$202 Adopting the variant 倚 instead of 猗. 
$203 In the Subha-sutta the Buddha illustrates this type of pleasure with the example of $the first and second absorptions. 
He then inquires which of the five principles declared $earlier by his visitor is reckoned most fruitful by the brahmins, which receives the $reply that this is generosity. 
This then provides the background for the ensuing descrip￾tion by the Buddha of a brahminical sacrifice, also found in MĀ 152. 
$204 In the simile in the Subha-sutta those who come to the sacrifice are also brahmins. 
$205 In the Subha-sutta the Buddha reckons the five principles to be equipments of the $mind for cultivating a mind free from anger and ill will. 
$206 At this juncture in the Subha-sutta the brahmin inquires about the path to Brahmā, $and it is in reply to this inquiry that the Buddha, after illustrating his knowledge of $the path to Brahmā with the example of someone who knows the way to his home $village, teaches the brahmavihāras. 
$207 In the Subha-sutta the young brahmin expresses his appreciation and leaves. 
Thus $the Subha-sutta has no counterpart to the ensuing discussion on aspiration for rebirth $as a deva; instead it continues by reporting that the young brahmin met the brahmin $Jāṇussoṇi, to whom he expressed his favorable impression of the Buddha. 
$208 This inquiry and the simile by the Buddha occur earlier in the Subha-sutta, before $the Buddha teaches the brahmavihāras as the path to Brahmā. 
$209 The Subha-sutta does not report that the young brahmin took refuge. 
$210 The Pāli parallel is the Māgandiya-sutta, MN 75 at MN I 501; for a comparative study $see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
407–413. 
$211 The Māgandiya-sutta does not describe the manner of lying down. 
$481$Notes$212 The Māgandiya-sutta does not refer to the Buddha’s dignified appearance or compare $it to the moon. 
$213 According to the Māgandiya-sutta, he was so surprised that his hair stood on end. 
$214 The corresponding inquiry in the Māgandiya-sutta just takes up the case of being $oneself free from the former attraction of sense objects, without bringing in the seeing $of another who is under the influence of such attraction. 
$215 In the Māgandiya-sutta the Buddha directly relates his own experiences. 
$216 The Māgandiya-sutta describes three palaces in which the Buddha-to-be enjoyed $himself in the company of females. 
$217 In the Māgandiya-sutta he only states that heavenly sensual pleasures are more $sublime, without qualifying human sensual pleasures as foul and impure. 
$218 The sequence of similes in the Māgandiya-sutta differs, as here the first two similes $are about a healed leper who does envy another leper cauterizing his wounds and who $resists being dragged close to a fire. 
Third comes the simile that corresponds to the $present passage, followed by the simile of a king who partakes of sensual pleasures. 
$219 Adopting the variant 憧 instead of 慞. 
$220 In the Māgandiya-sutta this first instance of the verse spoken by the Buddha already $comes with a reference to the eightfold path. 
$221 In the Māgandiya-sutta he adds that he is now healthy and happy, without afflictions. 
$222 Adopting the variant 往 instead of 住. 
$223 The Māgandiya-sutta has no remark on foolish heterodox practitioners. 
$224 In the Māgandiya-sutta a teaching on the dependent arising of dukkha, based on cling￾ing, is found only later. 
$225 In the corresponding simile in the Māgandiya-sutta a doctor unsuccessfully tries to $heal the blind person. 
$226 The Māgandiya-sutta does not mention giving proper attention and thus recommends $only three practices. 
$227 Instead of an exposition of the four truths, in the Māgandiya-sutta the Buddha teaches $the dependent arising of dukkha based on clinging, etc. 
$228 The Māgandiya-sutta does not report his stream-entry. 
$229 In the Māgandiya-sutta the Buddha first explains that those who come from other $traditions need to go through a probation period of four months. 
Māgandiya then $states he is willing to accept being on probation even for four years. 
$230 The Pāli parallel is the Aggañña-sutta, DN 27 at DN III 80; for a comparative study $482$Notes see Konrad Meisig, Das Sūtra von den vier Ständen, Das Aggañña-Sutta im Licht $seiner chinesischen Parallelen (Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1988). 
$231 In the Aggañña-sutta they have not yet received full ordination. 
$232 In the Aggañña-sutta the abuse by other brahmins occurs only as a part of Vāseṭṭha’s $report to the Buddha. 
$233 Adopting the variant 困 instead of 自. 
$234 The Aggañña-sutta does not report such an evaluation of the position taken by the $brahmins; instead the Buddha points out that brahmin women are seen to become $pregnant, an argument similar to the one found later in MĀ 154. 
$235 A statement that the Buddha does not talk about superiority of birth, etc., and a contrast $to those who are getting married, is not made in the Aggañña-sutta.$236 A comparable exposition in the Aggañña-sutta deals with all four castes. 
It also differs, $here and below, in not taking the form of a question-and-answer exchange. 
$237 In the PTS edition of the Aggañña-sutta the king does think that the Buddha is superior $to him in terms of being well-born, having strength, being good-looking, and being $influential. 
$238 After the topic of Pasenadi’s respect, in the Aggañña-sutta the Buddha presents those $gone forth under him as his children in the Dharma, born of his mouth, etc. 
$239 Here and below, the translation is based on emending 不 to 亦; cf.

$244 The Aggañña-sutta just states that they were unable to meditate. 
$245 The Aggañña-sutta instead introduces the fourth caste of the workers, and then dis￾cusses renunciants from any of the four castes. 
$246 The Pāli parallel is the Velāma-sutta, AN 9.20 at AN IV 392. 
$247 The Velāma-sutta instead refers to him by his well-known name Anāthapiṇḍika. 
$248 Here and below the Velāma-sutta also mentions that one’s family and servants will $not listen to one (or in the case of giving carefully, they will listen to one). 
$483$Notes$249 In the Velāma-sutta the exposition takes up giving either coarse or excellent food together, $so that it only distinguishes between giving carelessly, etc., and giving carefully, etc. 
$250 In the Velāma-sutta at this point the Buddha explains that he was Velāma in a past life. 
$251 The Velāma-sutta does not mention giving to all worldlings in Jambudīpa. 
$252 Before referring to the construction of a monastery, the Velāma-sutta mentions an $offering given to the Sangha with the Buddha at its head. 
$253 The Velāma-sutta only mentions perception of impermanence, cultivated for the time $it takes to snap a finger. 
$254 The identification as a past life of the Buddha occurs earlier in the Velāma-sutta, $which concludes after the recommendation of perception of impermanence and thus $has no counterpart to the final section in MĀ 155. 
$255 The Pāli parallel is the Brahmaṇadhammika-sutta, Sn 2.7 at Sn 284 to 315. 
$256 The verses in the Brahmaṇadhammika-sutta show several differences. 
$257 Adopting the variant 去 instead of 法. 
$258 Adopting the variant 牛 instead of 馬. 
$259 Adopting the variant 老 instead of 者. 
$260 In the Brahmaṇadhammika-sutta they illustrate the nature of the exposition received $with a standard set of similes that describe setting upright what had been overturned, $revealing what was hidden, etc. 
$261 The Pāli parallel is the Verañjā-sutta, AN 8.11 at AN IV 172, which has the base of $a particular tree in Verañjā as its location. 
$262 A reference to flavors, which seems to have been lost in the original, is clearly required $by the context and also found in the Verañjā-sutta.$263 After the accusation of lacking taste, the Verañjā-sutta continues with seven other $accusations by the brahmin, each of which the Buddha takes up and reinterprets in $such a way that it expresses his realization of awakening. 
None of these seven cor￾responds to the present reference to fear; the last one in the Pāli list, apagabbho, cor￾responds to the third and last accusation in MĀ 157 of not entering a womb. 
$264 The Verañjā-sutta does not describe the preparation of the seat of awakening or the $resolve not to change posture until awakening had been reached. 
$265 No reference to the Buddha’s teaching activity is found in the Verañjā-sutta.$266 In the Verañjā-sutta he states only that the Buddha is the eldest and foremost. 
$267 In the Verañjā-sutta he illustrates the nature of the exposition received with a standard $set of similes that describe setting upright what had been overturned, revealing what $was hidden, etc. 
$484$Notes$268 The Pāli parallel is the Doṇa-sutta, AN 5.192 at AN III 223. 
$269 The Doṇa-sutta instead reports Doṇa complaining that the Buddha does not respect $elder brahmins. 
$270 The Doṇa-sutta speaks only of three Vedas. 
$271 Here and below, the list of possible occupations is shorter in the Doṇa-sutta, which, $for example, does not mention writing. 
$272 The Doṇa-sutta mentions going forth, after giving wealth to the teacher and before $the practice of the brahmavihāras. 
$273 The Doṇa-sutta instead describes getting married and subsequently going forth and $cultivating the four absorptions. 
$274 Adopting the variant 淫 instead of 婬. 
$275 In the Doṇa-sutta the overstepping of boundaries comes through engaging in sex for $sensual pleasure with any type of wife, even one who is pregnant or nursing. 
$276 In the Doṇa-sutta the outcaste brahmin not only takes up various kinds of employment, $but also seeks wealth for his teacher by means some of which are in accordance with $the Dharma and some contrary to it. 
He also has intercourse with any type of wife, $even with ones who are pregnant or nursing. 
$277 In the Doṇa-sutta the Buddha, before asking this question, refers again to the ancient $seers as the source of the fivefold classification of brahmins. 
$278 In the Doṇa-sutta he illustrates the nature of the exposition received with a standard $set of similes that describe setting upright what had been overturned, revealing what $was hidden, etc. 
$279 A part of MĀ 160 has a Pāli parallel in the Araka-sutta, AN 7.70 at AN IV 136. 
$280 The Araka-sutta does not mention the monks’ discussion, life conditions in the past, $a former king, and Araka’s going forth. 
It begins with the Buddha briefly introducing $Araka as a teacher who was free of sensual desire, then goes on to Araka’s teachings $on the brevity of human life. 
$281 The Araka-sutta speaks of a line drawn on the surface of water with a stick. 
$282 Adopting the variant 盂 instead of 杅. 
$283 This simile has no counterpart in the Araka-sutta.$284 The Araka-sutta, where this is the sixth simile, speaks of a piece of meat thrown into $an iron pan heated all day. 
$285 This simile has no counterpart in the Araka-sutta.$286 This simile has no counterpart in the Araka-sutta. 
$485$Notes$287 Adopting the variant 暴長 instead of 瀑涱. 
$288 Adopting the variant 駛 instead of 駃. 
The image of a quickly flowing river is the $fourth simile in the Araka-sutta.$289 This simile has no counterpart in the Araka-sutta.$290 After the similes, in the Araka-sutta the Buddha contrasts the long life span at the time $of Araka to the life span at present, and then divides this into fortnights, days and nights, $and meals, more or less as in MĀ 160. 
The Araka-sutta does not mention Araka’s $removal of the hindrances and cultivation of the brahmavihāras or the rebirths achieved $by his disciples; nor does it identify Araka as a past life of the Buddha. 
$291 The Pāli parallel is the Brahmāyu-sutta, MN 91 at MN II 133; for a comparative $study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
527–545. 
$292 The Brahmāyu-sutta, which has a similar description for Brahmāyu himself, speaks $only of three Vedas. 
$293 The Brahmāyu-sutta does not report that Brahmāyu had heard that the Buddha was $endowed with the thirty-two marks. 
$294 Adopting a variant without 世. 
$295 In the Brahmāyu-sutta Uttara inquires how he should verify the Buddha’s accom￾plishment. 
In reply to this inquiry, Brahmāyu speaks of the thirty-two marks and the $two destinies open to those who are endowed with these marks. 
$296 In the Brahmāyu-sutta he observes the Buddha for seven months. 
The Pāli version $does not report that he took leave after that from the Buddha. 
$297 Adopting the variant 平 instead of 牙. 
$298 After reporting on the thirty-two marks, in the Brahmāyu-sutta Uttara does not depict $the comprehensiveness of his observation, but right away describes the Buddha’s $behavior, starting with how the Buddha walked. 
This description shows some variations $in details compared to MĀ 161. 
$299 Adopting the variant 飯 instead of 飲. 
$300 Adopting the variant 暫 instead of 慚. 
$301 The Brahmāyu-sutta does not report Uttara’s wish to go forth under the Buddha or $this being granted. 
Instead it depicts Brahmāyu expressing his reverence for the $Buddha after having heard Uttara’s report. 
$302 In the Brahmāyu-sutta Brahmāyu sends someone to announce his visit as a matter $of propriety, not because he feels intimidated. 
$303 In the Brahmāyu-sutta the Buddha simply gives his permission, without expressing $a wish for the well-being of the visitor or others. 
$486$Notes$304 In the Brahmāyu-sutta the Buddha continues right away with the next stanza granting $Brahmāyu permission to ask a question. 
$305 The inquiry in the Brahmāyu-sutta takes up more epithets of a liberated one. 
$306 Adopting the variant 行 instead of 正. 
$307 Adopting the variant 訖 instead of 說. 
$308 In the Brahmāyu-sutta he even goes so far as to kiss the Buddha’s feet. 
$309 The Brahmāyu-sutta does not report the crowd specifying the qualities in which Brah￾māyu was foremost among brahmins of Mithilā. 
$310 In the Brahmāyu-sutta he illustrates the nature of the exposition received with a stan￾dard set of similes that describe setting upright what had been overturned, revealing $what was hidden, etc. 
$311 The Brahmāyu-sutta does not report the blessing given by the Buddha after the meal; $according to its presentation, Brahmāyu offered food for a whole week. 
$312 The translation is based on emending 生彼 to read 生(於)彼間, the formulation usually $employed in the Madhyama-āgama to describe the rebirth of a nonreturner. 
$Division 13$313 The Pāli parallel is the Dhātuvibhaṅga-sutta, MN 140 at MN III 237; for a comparative $study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
797–802. 
$314 In the Dhātuvibhaṅga-sutta the Buddha also asks Pukkusāti where his teacher is $dwelling at present. 
$315 The Dhātuvibhaṅga-sutta does not refer to the sublime nature of the Dharma or the $purity of the holy life. 
$316 According to the corresponding passage in the Dhātuvibhaṅga-sutta, one established in $the four foundations is not overwhelmed by conceiving and is reckoned a sage at peace. 
$317 The Dhātuvibhaṅga-sutta lists the six contacts by way of the respective sense organ, $without mentioning their objects. 
$318 The text refers to the brain stem, 腦膜, with brain marrow as a variant, 腦髓. 
Since $both are out of place in a list of bodily parts that belong to the water element, the $compound has been emended to brain fluid, on the supposition that 腦膜 is an error $for 腦液 or some equivalent term. 
$319 The Dhātuvibhaṅga-sutta lists only happy, painful, and neutral experiences. 
$320 The Dhātuvibhaṅga-sutta continues by describing how in this way liberation is attained. 
$321 Before turning to feelings that are limited to the body, the Dhātuvibhaṅga-sutta dis￾cusses the detached experience of happy, painful, and neutral feelings by one who $knows their impermanent and unsatisfactory nature. 
$487$Notes$322 Adopting the variant 設若 instead of 說施若. 
$323 The Dhātuvibhaṅga-sutta instead qualifies these various ideas as something “conceived,” $maññita, concluding that all such conceivings are a disease, a tumor, and a barb. 
$324 In the Dhātuvibhaṅga-sutta the result of going beyond conceivings is that the sage, $who is at peace, is not born, does not grow old, does not die, is not shaken or agitated. 
$325 The corresponding section in the Dhātuvibhaṅga-sutta does not mention Pukkusāti’s $attainment of stream-entry, although in its concluding part the Buddha states that $Pukkusāti passed away as a nonreturner. 
$326 The Dhātuvibhaṅga-sutta continues by narrating that Pukkusāti requested full ordi￾nation from the Buddha, which he could not receive as his bowl and robes were not $complete. 
Searching for the missing requisites, he was accidentally killed by a cow. 
$The monks reported this to the Buddha, who told them that Pukkusāti passed away $as a nonreturner. 
$327 The Pāli parallel is the Saḷāyatanavibhaṅga-sutta, MN 137 at MN III 215; for a com￾parative study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
781–787. 
$328 The Saḷāyatanavibhaṅga-sutta does not refer to the sublime nature of the Dharma or $the purity of the holy life. 
$329 The Saḷāyatanavibhaṅga-sutta lists the six internal sense spheres, the six external $sense spheres, the six types of consciousness, and the six types of contact. 
$330 The text reads 刀, literally “knife,” which appears to be a translation error that confuses $satta (Skt. 
sattva) with sattha (Skt. 
śastra). 
The Saḷāyatanavibhaṅga-sutta speaks of $thirty-two “positions of beings,” sattapadā. 
In order to render 刀 in a way that makes $some sense, the translation follows the indication in Hirakawa, Buddhist Chinese￾Sanskrit Dictionary, p. 
182, that 刀 can render āyudha, “weapon” or “implement.” $331 The Saḷāyatanavibhaṅga-sutta lists only the contacts, without their objects. 
$332 The Saḷāyatanavibhaṅga-sutta differs in speaking of joy related to “the household $life,” gehasita, instead of related to “attachment.” It also differs in first working $through all six senses in relation to the first of these two aspects before turning to $sense experience related to renunciation or dispassion. 
$333 The Saḷāyatanavibhaṅga-sutta qualifies such equanimity as transcending its object. 
$334 The Saḷāyatanavibhaṅga-sutta rather recommends overcoming sadness with joy (both $of course being of the type related to renunciation). 
$335 The Saḷāyatanavibhaṅga-sutta recommends relying on nonidentification, atammayatā, $to abandon and go beyond unified equanimity. 
$336 This part is without a counterpart in the Saḷāyatanavibhaṅga-sutta. 
The situation of $teaching four disciples has a parallel in the Mahāsīhanāda-sutta, MN 12 at MN I 82. 
$488$Notes$337 According to the Saḷāyatanavibhaṅga-sutta, the Buddha is not satisfied because of this. 
$338 According to the Saḷāyatanavibhaṅga-sutta, the Buddha is satisfied because of this. 
$Another difference is that in the Pāli version this is the third of the three establishments $of mindfulness. 
$339 The Pāli parallel is the Uddesavibhaṅga-sutta, MN 138 at MN III 223; for a comparative $study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
787–793. 
$340 The Uddesavibhaṅga-sutta does not refer to the sublime nature of the Dharma or the $purity of the holy life. 
$341 Here and below, the translation is based on emending 不受 to 受, which is clearly the $reading required by the context. 
$342 The Uddesavibhaṅga-sutta instead contrasts consciousness distracted externally to $its being stuck internally. 
$343 Here and below, the Uddesavibhaṅga-sutta does not discuss the immaterial attain￾ments. 
$344 The Uddesavibhaṅga-sutta instead brings in the four modes of construing a sense of $self in regard to each aggregate. 
It also differs inasmuch as the one who experiences $agitation is the unlearned worldling. 
$345 In the Uddesavibhaṅga-sutta the Buddha states that he would have explained it in $the same way. 
$346 The Pāli parallel is the Mahākaccānabhaddekaratta-sutta, MN 133 at MN III 192, $which has the Tapodārāma in Rājagaha as its location; for comparative studies see $Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
760–763, and Madhyama-$āgama Studies, pp. 
421–448. 
$347 In the Mahākaccānabhaddekaratta-sutta the deva asks if Samiddhi knows the summary $and analysis on an auspicious night, and afterward asks him again if he knows the $verses on an auspicious night. 
$348 In the Pāli version the deva states that these verses are beneficial and important for $the holy life, after which it disappears. 
It does not have Samiddhi’s question about $who knows the verses, as well as the deva’s reply. 
$349 In the Mahākaccānabhaddekaratta-sutta Samiddhi does not report the meeting he had $with the deva and the Buddha does not inform him of the deva’s name. 
Instead Samiddhi $directly asks about the verses and the Buddha replies by uttering them. 
$350 From here onward the verses in the Mahākaccānabhaddekaratta-sutta show several $differences. 
$351 Adopting the variant reading 作 instead of 學. 
$489$Notes$352 The qualification of the senses as “really existing,” 實有, is not made in the Mahā -$kaccāna bhaddekaratta-sutta.$353 In the Mahākaccānabhaddekaratta-sutta the Buddha states that he would have $explained it in the same way. 
$354 The Pāli parallel is the Lomasakaṅgiyabhaddekaratta-sutta, MN 134 at MN III 199; $for a comparative study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, $pp. 
763–767. 
$355 In the Lomasakaṅgiyabhaddekaratta-sutta the deva asks if Lomasakaṅgiya knows $the summary and analysis on an auspicious night, and afterward asks him again if he $knows the verses on an auspicious night. 
$356 According to the Lomasakaṅgiyabhaddekaratta-sutta, the Buddha had taught the $verses during a visit to the Heaven of the Thirty-three. 
$357 From here onward the verses in the Lomasakaṅgiyabhaddekaratta-sutta show several $differences. 
$358 The Pali version lacks Lomasakaṅgiya’s question about who knows the meaning of $the verses, and also the deva’s reply. 
$359 In the Lomasakaṅgiyabhaddekaratta-sutta he approaches the Buddha the next morning. 
$360 The Lomasakaṅgiyabhaddekaratta-sutta instead discusses the twenty modes of con￾struing a sense of self: identifying any one of the five aggregates as self, postulating $the self as the owner of the aggregate, assuming the aggregate to exist within the self, $or locating the self within the aggregate. 
$361 The Pāli parallel is the Ānandabhaddekaratta-sutta, MN 132 at MN III 189; for a com￾parative study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
755–759. 
$362 In the Ānandabhaddekaratta-sutta the Buddha joins the monks, is told about the $exposition given by Ānanda, and then asks Ānanda to repeat it. 
$363 From here onward the verses in the Ānandabhaddekaratta-sutta show several dif￾ferences. 
$364 Instead of a question and answer exchange between the Buddha and Ānanda, in the $Ānandabhaddekaratta-sutta all questions and explanations are given by Ānanda. 
Once $he has completed his exposition, the Buddha approvingly repeats it all. 
$365 The Ānandabhaddekaratta-sutta instead discusses the twenty modes of construing a $sense of self: identifying any one of the five aggregates as self, postulating the self $as the owner of the aggregate, assuming the aggregate to exist within the self, or $locating the self within the aggregate. 
$366 For MĀ 168, Chizen Akanuma, The Comparative Catalogue of Chinese Āgamas & $Pāli Nikāyas (1929) (Delhi: Sri Satguru, 1990), p. 
21, lists as a parallel the Saṅkhāru￾papatti-sutta, MN 120 at MN III 99. 
Yet these two discourses differ considerably $490$Notes from each other, making it difficult to consider them to be parallels properly speaking; $see the discussion in Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, p. 
678f. 
$367 The Pāli parallel is the Araṇavibhaṅga-sutta, MN 139 at MN III 230, which has Jeta’s $Grove at Sāvatthī as its location; for a comparative study see Anālayo, A Comparative $Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
793–796. 
$368 The reference to the Bhaggās appears to be an error, as the Bhaggā country is at a $different location from the Kuru country. 
$369 The Araṇavibhaṅga-sutta does not refer to the sublime nature of the Dharma or the $purity of the holy life. 
$370 Adopting the variant 不 instead of 求. 
$371 The Araṇavibhaṅga-sutta qualifies each of these two extremes as the wrong path. 
$372 The Araṇavibhaṅga-sutta does not have the theme of searching for happiness within $under the heading of blame and praise. 
$373 Instead of praising someone to his face, the issue in the Araṇavibhaṅga-sutta is speak￾ing roughly. 
$374 The Araṇavibhaṅga-sutta contrasts speaking hurriedly to speaking unhurriedly. 
$375 The verse is not found in the Araṇavibhaṅga-sutta.$376 The Pāli parallel is the Cūḷakammavibhaṅga-sutta, MN 135 at MN III 202; for a com￾parative study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
767–775. 
$377 The introductory narration on the Buddha’s meeting with the dog is not found in the $Cūḷakammavibhaṅga-sutta, which instead begins with the young brahmin approaching $the Buddha and inquiring about the cause for the diversity among human beings. 
The $Pāli commentary, Ps V 9, however, contains a report similar to the introductory account $in MĀ 170. 
$378 Insects are not mentioned in the Cūḷakammavibhaṅga-sutta.$379 The addition of “[either]” and “[or else]” seems to be required by the context, since $later on the exposition takes up issues such as giving gifts of asking questions, the $not doing of which could hardly be reckoned as something that certainly leads to $rebirth in hell. 
In fact in the Cūḷakammavibhaṅga-sutta rebirth among humans is $clearly an alternative to rebirth in hell. 
$380 In the Cūḷakammavibhaṅga-sutta he illustrates the nature of the exposition received $with a standard set of similes that describe setting upright what had been overturned, $revealing what was hidden, etc. 
$381 Such an invitation is not reported in the Cūḷakammavibhaṅga-sutta.$382 The Pāli parallel is the Mahākammavibhaṅga-sutta, MN 136 at MN III 207; for a comparative $study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
775–781. 
$491$Notes$383 In the Mahākammavibhaṅga-sutta Samiddhi does not quote any such saying by the $Buddha, nor does that version record three instances of the same exchange between $Potaliputta and Samiddhi. 
$384 In the Mahākammavibhaṅga-sutta Potaliputta first asks how long Samiddhi has been $a monk, and then inquires after the result of intentional deeds. 
$385 The Mahākammavibhaṅga-sutta does not mention Mahācunda; instead it reports that $Samiddhi himself related to Ānanda what had happened. 
$386 In the Mahākammavibhaṅga-sutta the Buddha also points out that he has never met $Potaliputta. 
$387 According to the Mahākammavibhaṅga-sutta, a remark of this type was made by $Udāyin instead of Ānanda. 
$388 The Mahākammavibhaṅga-sutta adopts a different sequence for these topics. 
It begins $with evil conduct leading to hell, followed by evil conduct leading to heaven, and $then discusses good conduct leading to heaven or to hell. 
$389 Here and below, the Mahākammavibhaṅga-sutta does not mention the possibility $that retribution for unwholesome (or later wholesome) conduct could have already $been experienced earlier. 
For the present case, the Pāli version mentions wholesome $conduct performed either before or after the unwholesome conduct (which had been $witnessed by others with the divine eye), as well as the holding of right view at the $time of death. 
The Mahākammavibhaṅga-sutta concludes by stipulating that the $results of the unwholesome (or later wholesome) conduct are to be experienced, be $it now, or in the next life, or at a later time. 
$390 The simile of the four types of fruit is not found in the Mahākammavibhaṅga-sutta. 
$Division 14$391 The Pāli parallel is the Ummagga-sutta, AN 4.186 at AN II 177. 
$392 The Ummagga-sutta begins with the monk visiting the Buddha and does not report $the monk’s earlier reflection while in seclusion. 
$393 The Ummagga-sutta does not describe the one who is not led by the mind. 
$394 As is usual in Pāli discourses, the Ummagga-sutta lists just nine aṅgas, not mentioning $nidāna, apadāna, or upadesa.$395 The Ummagga-sutta concludes with this exposition by the Buddha and does not $report what happened subsequently with the monk. 
$396 The Pāli parallel is the Bhūmija-sutta, MN 126 at MN III 138; for a comparative study $see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
723–726. 
$397 The emendation involves deleting a qualification of “practice” as being done “properly,” $a qualification that has its proper place only in the reply by the monk, when it is the $492$Notes introduction of this qualification that then causes the prince to be satisfied with the $monk’s reply. 
This is in fact how the Pāli parallel proceeds, supporting the impression $that the qualification of practicing the holy life “properly” originally only belonged $to the monk’s reply and would have become part of the preceding question by the $prince through an error in transmission. 
$398 The similar inquiry of the prince in the Bhūmija-sutta is concerned with inability to $get results. 
$399 The Bhūmija-sutta reports that the prince offered his own dish of milk rice to Bhūmija; $it does not report a formal invitation to a meal or a Dharma talk by Bhūmija. 
$400 In the Bhūmija-sutta the Buddha first acknowledges that Bhūmija had spoken correctly. 
$401 The Bhūmija-sutta begins with the simile on wrongly trying to get oil, followed by $wrongly trying to get milk, butter, and fire, and then has the four similes corresponding $to the case of doing these actions in the right way. 
$402 The Pāli parallel is the Cūḷadhammasamādāna-sutta, MN 45 at MN I 305; for a com￾parative study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
286–289. 
$403 The Cūḷadhammasamādāna-sutta has the second and third cases in the reverse sequence. 
$404 One of several differences in the description of ascetic practices is that the Cūḷa -$dhamma samādāna-sutta does not mention shaving off the hair and beard (a practice $in fact followed by Buddhist monastics themselves). 
$405 The translation is based on emending 生彼 to read 生(於)彼間, the formulation usually $employed in the Madhyama-āgama to describe the rebirth of a nonreturner. 
$406 Instead of the attainment of nonreturn, the Cūḷadhammasamādāna-sutta mentions $attainment of the four absorptions and rebirth in heaven. 
$407 The Pāli parallel is the Mahādhammasamādāna-sutta, MN 46 at MN I 309, which has $Jeta’s Grove at Sāvatthī as its location; for a comparative study see Anālayo, A Com￾parative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
289–291. 
$408 The Mahādhammasamādāna-sutta, instead of referring to the profundity of the $Buddha’s teaching, has the monks request the Buddha to explain the issue. 
It also $takes up the four ways of practice only later, after having described the ignorant $person and the wise. 
$409 In the Mahādhammasamādāna-sutta the sequence of these four is: pain leading to $pain, pleasure leading to pain, pain leading to pleasure, pleasure leading to pleasure. 
$410 Here and below, the Mahādhammasamādāna-sutta speaks of good and bad rebirth, $instead of evaluating the mode of conduct in terms of its conduciveness to nirvana. 
$411 Here and below, in the Mahādhammasamādāna-sutta the person is informed of the $properties of the drink, and consuming it results in his death or deadly pain. 
Another $difference is that all four similes are located together at the end of the discourse. 
$493$Notes$412 Adopting the variant 退具 instead of 所行, in keeping with the formulation found sub￾sequently. 
$413 The translation is based on emending the original, which reads “infinite space”; the $context shows this to be an error. 
$414 Adopting the variant 禪 instead of 離, in keeping with the formulation found in other $parts of the present description. 
$415 The Pāli parallel is the Nivāpa-sutta, MN 25 at MN I 151, which has Jeta’s Grove at $Sāvatthī as its location; for a comparative study see Anālayo, A Comparative Study $of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
167–169. 
$416 Adopting a variant reading that adds 便 before 隨. 
$417 In the Nivāpa-sutta, before deciding to forsake the fourth herd of deer, the hunter and $his following had tried to catch them with the same stratagem they had successfully $employed with the third herd. 
$418 The Nivāpa-sutta mentions only loss of their liberation of the mind, not of their lib￾eration by wisdom. 
$419 In the Nivāpa-sutta the renunciants and brahmins take up the ten types of undeclared $views (the world is eternal, the world is not eternal, the world is finite ...
a tathāgata $neither exists nor does not exist after death). 
$420 No such explanation is given in the Nivāpa-sutta.$421 The Nivāpa-sutta does not mention the brahmavihāras. 
$422 The Nivāpa-sutta adds that in this way one has become invisible to Māra. 
$423 Adopting the variant reading 止令 instead of 正命. 
$424 The Pāli parallel is the Samaṇamuṇḍikā-sutta, MN 78 at MN II 22; for comparative $studies see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
424–431, and $Madhyama-āgama Studies, pp. 
105–138. 
$425 In the Samaṇamuṇḍikā-sutta the child expresses its thoughts by sulking and its liveli￾hood is the mother’s milk. 
$426 According to the Samaṇamuṇḍikā-sutta, such a person is not even accomplished in $what is wholesome. 
$427 Here and below, in addition to bodily and verbal conduct the Samaṇamuṇḍikā-sutta speaks of livelihood. 
$428 Here and below, in the Samaṇamuṇḍikā-sutta the path to the cessation of conduct or $thoughts is to be found in the four right efforts. 
$429 The Samaṇamuṇḍikā-sutta adds understanding of liberation of the mind and liberation $by wisdom. 
$494$Notes$430 Following an emendation in the CBETA edition of 慈 to read 恚, in keeping with the $reading found in the rest of the passage. 
$431 The cessation of wholesome thoughts occurs in the Samaṇamuṇḍikā-sutta already $with the second absorption. 
$432 The Samaṇamuṇḍikā-sutta continues at this point with the ten path factors of an arahant. 
$433 This conditional sequence of the path factors is not mentioned in the Samaṇamuṇḍikā-$sutta; a similar presentation is, however, found in the Mahācattārīsaka-sutta, MN $117 at MN III 76 (which covers all ten path factors). 
$434 A description of the noble disciple who contemplates wisely, develops the factors $of the noble eightfold path, and attains liberation is not found in the Samaṇamuṇḍikā-$sutta.$435 The Pāli parallel is the Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga-sutta, MN 142 at MN III 253; for com￾parative studies see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
810–$819; Ingo Strauch, “The Bajaur Collection of Kharoṣṭhī Manuscripts: Mahāprajāpatī$Gautamī and the Order of Nuns in a Gandhāran Version of the Dakṣiṇāvibhaṅgasūtra,” $in Alice Collett, ed., Women in Early Indian Buddhism: Comparative Textual Studies $(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), pp. 
17–45, and “The Indic Versions of the $*Dakṣiṇāvibhaṅgasūtra: Some Thoughts about the Early Transmission of Buddhist $Āgama Texts,” in Dhammadinnā, ed., Research on the Madhyama-āgama (Taipei: $Dharma Drum Publishing Corporation, 2017), pp. 
327–373. 
$436 The Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga-sutta does not specify the color of the robe. 
$437 In the Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga-sutta it is Ānanda who lists the ways in which the Buddha $has benefited Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī. 
$438 The Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga-sutta takes these up in the reverse sequence, discussing first $the fourteen kinds of personal offerings and then the seven offerings to the Sangha. 
$439 The Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga-sutta instead speaks of a gift given to both communities $headed by the Buddha. 
$440 The emendation is guided by the context; the original speaks of the fifth, 第五. 
$441 In the Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga-sutta these are even described as “immoral and evil,” dussīla $pāpadhamma.$442 Here and below, the Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga-sutta distinguishes between donor and recip￾ients who are either of moral or else of immoral behavior. 
$443 No reference to offerings made by slaves and the poor is found in the Dakkhiṇā -$vibhaṅga-sutta.$444 The Pāli parallel is the Bahudhātuka-sutta, MN 115 at MN III 61; for comparative $studies see Anālayo, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, pp. 
645–654, and $Madhyama-āgama Studies, pp. 
249–288. 
$495$Notes$445 In the Bahudhātuka-sutta the contrast is between a fool and a wise person, and this $contrast is directly broached by the Buddha himself, without a preceding report that $Ānanda had been reflecting on this. 
$446 The application of the same principle to past and future times is not made in the $Bahudhātuka-sutta.$447 The Bahudhātuka-sutta does not mention that Ānanda was in tears. 
$448 In the Bahudhātuka-sutta Ānanda directly asks about a monk who is wise, without $bringing up the topic of a monk who is foolish. 
$449 In the Bahudhātuka-sutta Ānanda intervenes each time and asks if there could be still $another way of being skilled in the elements. 
$450 These four elements are not listed in the Bahudhātuka-sutta, which also has no counter -$parts for the sets of three elements, except the first set of three (sense sphere, etc.), $and for the two elements related to the taints. 
$451 This and the six following qualities have a single counterpart in the Bahudhātuka￾sutta, according to which a person who has right view will not follow another teacher. 
$452 The presentation here departs from the usual sequence of listing the four truths, which $has the cessation of dukkha as third and the path as fourth. 
$453 The impossibility of a stream-enterer experiencing an eighth existence is not discussed $in the Bahudhātuka-sutta.$454 This and the subsequent impossibilities are not mentioned in the Bahudhātuka-sutta. 
$455 The Bahudhātuka-sutta gives five names for the discourse: “Many Kinds of Elements,” $“Four Turnings,” “Mirror of Dharma,” “Drum of the Deathless,” and “Unsurpassable $Victory in Battle.”$496$Bibliography$Akanuma, Chizen.
